Hey, Mama. Mom! 
Look at that. 
Look, Mommy, look. 
Johnny! 
Now you let Mommy do the talking. 
Remember. 
Yes, Mom. 
But he has no horse. 
No talking. 
Good morning. 
- You look like you've had trouble. 
- Yep. 
I lost my horse a few days ago getting away from some Indians. 
Indians? 
We made dry camp last night above the llano. 
Sam here smelt more Apaches, nuzzled me up. 
So I thought I'd put some miles between us. 
But why? 
We're at peace with the Apache. 
- We have a treaty. 
- Yes, ma'am. 
Now I got to get me a new horse, borrow or buy one. 
I can pay you in United States script. 
I'm riding a dispatch for General Crook. 
- My name's Lane. 
- I'm Mrs. Lowe. 
I'm Johnny. 
- The water sure looks inviting. 
- Well, help yourself. 
Watch out for that dog, son. 
Could you hire me or sell me a horse, Mrs. Lowe? 
Of course. 
I've only got plow horses, and two that are only half-broken. 
The hand that was breaking them for me got hurt and had to go to town. 
- You mean you're staying here alone? 
- Oh, no. 
No, my husband is up in the hills, 
- working some cattle. - Oh. 
He would pick today to be away, when we have a visitor. 
I'd enjoy meeting him, ma'am. 
I wouldn't touch that dog, son. 
He don't take to petting. 
And now if you'll allow, ma'am, I'll take a look at those horses. 
Of course. 
You'll find a saddle over by the barn. 
In the meantime, I'll fix you something to eat. I imagine you're hungry. 
I could eat. Thank you. 
I'm so sorry my husband had to pick today to go hunting those lost calves. 
He would have enjoyed having a man to talk to. 
We welcome visitors. 
Must be right lonely around here. 
Especially for a woman. 
I don't mind. I was raised here. 
- What can I feed your dog? 
- Nothing, thanks. 
He makes out by himself. 
Can outrun any rabbit in the territory. 
It's no trouble at all. 
If you don't mind, ma'am, I'd rather you didn't feed him. 
I see. 
You don't want him to get in the habit of taking food from anyone else. 
Well, you can hand it to him. 
No, ma'am, I don't feed him, either. 
Sam's independent. 
He doesn't need anybody. 
I want him to stay that way. 
It's a good way. 
- Everyone needs someone. 
- Yes, ma'am. 
Most everyone. 
Too bad, isn't it? 
- You're a good cook, ma'am. 
- Thank you. 
A woman should be a good cook. 
Good cook myself. 
Why didn't you get on him when he was stuck? 
'Cause I didn't want him sitting on me from a standing start. 
Stay with him. 
You chose the most savage one. 
I won't give you an argument there. 
He's always been a fighter. 
I wouldn't give a plugged nickel for a horse that wouldn't fight. 
It lets you down when the going gets tough. 
It's a little dull. 
Well, I can do almost everything around a ranch, but I never could put an edge on an ax. 
Where is it? 
- What? 
- The grindstone. 
This ranch looks like it's been here a little while. 
Yes, I was born here. 
My husband was raised here, too. 
His parents got killed in a wagon-train massacre, so my father took him in. He's an orphan. 
- Handy. 
- What do you mean? 
Well, it seems the figures are against it. 
Only young fellow in 1, 000 square miles, only young girl in 1, 000 square miles. 
They get in a whirl over each other. 
That's what I meant. 
Handy. 
I guess it was quite a coincidence. 
But they say that the right two people are going to meet by an arrangement of destiny. 
You believe that, Mrs. Lowe? 
- Yes, I do. 
- Interesting. 
Always sink a blade into a log, son. 
Keeps the edge clean. 
Well, I guess I'd better quit stalling and get back to that horse. 
And can I play with Sam now? 
I've told you twice not to. 
But you do what you wanna do. 
Really, Mr. Lane, if you knew the dog would bite, I should think... 
Mrs. Lowe, people learn by getting bit. 
Youngster just learned. 
Johnny. 
Don't you ever touch that dog again! 
Now go in and take your nap. 
While I'm at it, I'll shoe those plow horses. 
Thank you very much. 
They do need a shoeing, I guess. 
They do. 
I guess my husband's having a hard time finding those strayed calves. 
I guess he is. 
Perhaps he won't be home until late tonight, or he may even camp in the hills and come in tomorrow after you're gone. 
He'll be so sorry to have missed one of our very few occasional visitors. 
I guess I'll go and look after Johnny. 
Mrs. Lowe, you're a liar. 
- And an almighty poor liar. 
- l don't understand you. 
These horses haven't been shod in a couple of months. 
It's a cinch that ax hasn't had an edge on it in two months. 
And your tea can, a five-pound tea can in your house is empty. 
Your husband's been gone a long time. 
Now, look here, Mr. Lane, I don't think you have any right to... 
I'm not talking about rights. I'm talking about lies. 
Why did you lie to me, Mrs. Lowe? 
Were you afraid that maybe you wouldn't be safe here with me with your husband away? 
- That it? 
- That's partly it. 
Women always figure every man comes along wants them. 
- Mr. Lane. 
- Yes, ma'am? 
You're right. I was lying. 
My husband is overdue. 
He should have been home long ago. 
Figure Apaches killed him? 
Of course not. 
There are a hundred possible explanations. 
Indians are one of them. 
But we're at peace with the Apache, except for a few... 
Mrs. Lowe, if you've got good sense, you'll pack up you and that boy of yours and come out with me. 
There's trouble brewing in the Apache lodges. 
Vittorio, their main chief, called a war council. 
A full report of it is in that dispatch I'm carrying. 
But you don't know, we've always gotten along splendidly with the Apache. 
They drink and bring their horses to our spring on their way north to the buffalo hunt. 
I've never seen the great Vittorio, but there've been plenty of Apaches here. 
I've seen the great Vittorio, before the treaty. 
His horse had 40 scalps hung in its mane. 
That was before the treaty. 
We broke that treaty, us Whites. 
There's no word in the Apache language for lie, and they've been lied to. 
If they rise, there won't be 
- a White left in the territory. 
- They won't bother me. 
Us, I mean. 
We always got along very well. 
People I know, man and his wife, got along real well for 20 years. 
Then one day, she upped and blew a hole in him, big enough to drive a stagecoach through. 
She got mad. 
The Apaches are mad. 
Well, I have nothing to worry about, I'm sure. 
Nice to be sure. 
Get out of the way. 
- Strange dog you have. 
- l don't have him. 
- The two of you are together. 
- He stays with me. 
- He can smell an Indian at a half a mile. 
- He smells Indians? 
I don't believe it. 
Sure, lots of dogs smell Indians. 
You can teach them. 
Teach them? 
How? 
First you get yourself a puppy and then, you hire yourself a tame Indian and cut a willow switch. 
Then you get the Indian to beat the puppy with a willow switch four or five times a day. 
And when he grows up, he'll always signal when he smells an Indian. 
Beat a puppy. 
How cruel. 
That's the way they do it. 
Anyway, I don't believe a dog can smell Indians. 
I mean, as different from anyone else. 
- You or me, for instance. 
- Well, they can. 
As a matter of fact, Indians can smell White people. 
- l don't believe it. 
- Well, it's true. 
I'm part Indian, and I can smell you when I'm downwind of you. 
- That's impossible. 
- No, it isn't impossible, Mrs. Lowe. 
You baked today. 
I can smell fresh bread on you. 
Sometime today you cooked with salt pork. 
Smell that on you, too. 
You smell all over like soap. 
You took a bath. 
And on top of that, you smell all over like a woman. 
I could find you in the dark, Mrs. Lowe, and I'm only part Indian. 
Mrs. Lowe. 
- l watered and grained the stock. 
- Thank you. 
I'll bed down near here someplace tonight. 
Mr. Lane? 
You can't sleep outside, there's a storm coming. 
I've fixed a pallet for you in the corner. 
It would be uncivilized to let anyone sleep outside, and after all, we are civilized, aren't we? 
Speaking for you, of course. 
But me? 
I guess you could call me civilized. 
That's your bed. 
I'm sorry it has to be on the floor. 
I have to set the batter for the morning. 
I hope the noise won't disturb you. 
It won't. 
Good night, ma'am. 
Put that gun down. 
You're Hondo Lane, the gunman. 
- l carry a gun. 
- Don't come any nearer. 
You killed three men in a gunfight last year. 
- We heard about it. 
Three men. 
- Yes, ma'am. 
- Just as quick as I could. 
- Don't come any nearer. 
It's not a very good idea to point one of these things at anybody with an empty chamber under the firing pin. 
You can see it plain as day. 
I keep it that way because of Johnny. 
Well, now it's loaded. 
Keep it that way, and keep it high. 
Please stay. I really want you to. 
I'm sorry. I should have realized from the beginning that you are a gentleman. 
Civilized? 
Gentleman? 
Well, a lot for one day. 
Night, ma'am. 
Morning. 
Getting an early start. 
Be sure and tell that little man goodbye for me. 
I ought to wake him to say goodbye to you. 
Was it me, I'd let him sleep. 
Youngsters grow sleeping, but you do what you want to. 
He was so delighted with that whistle you made for him. 
Glad to hear it. 
He and I got along just fine. 
It's more like a flute than a whistle. 
It ranges almost the full scale. 
I learned to make them when I was living with the Mescalero. 
My squaw used to make them for every kid in the lodge. 
- You lived with the Apache? 
- Five years. 
- And you had an Indian wife? 
- Wife, squaw... I took the liberty of borrowing a few feet of rope off of that coil in the lean-to. 
- Gladly pay you for it, if you let me. 
-' Course not. 
The hills are so beautiful today. 
Odd how clear they always are after a dust storm. 
Must have been very interesting living with the Apache. 
I liked it. 
- This Indian wife you have... 
- Had. 
She's dead. 
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up an unhappy memory. 
I can't remember anything unhappy about Destarte. 
Destarte? 
How musical. 
What does it mean? 
You can't say it except in Mescalero. 
It means morning. 
But that isn't what it means, either. 
Means more than just that. 
Indian words mean the sound and feel of a word, like, crack of dawn, the first bronze light that makes the buttes stand out against the gray desert. 
The first sound you hear of a brook curling over some rocks, with trout jumping. 
It's like when you get up in the first light, just you and her and you go out of a wickiup. 
Where it smells kind of smoky and private, just you and her, and kind of safe with just the two of you. 
Stand outside and feel the bite of the first wind coming down from the high divide that promises snowfall. 
Can't say it in English, but that was her name. 
Destarte. 
- You remind me of her some. 
- Of an Indian girl? 
Was she fair? 
Her hair was black as 1 0 feet down. 
Did you ever see a crow's wing, how black and gleaming it is? 
- Yes. 
- That's the way her hair shined. 
I'd like to pay you for that rope. 
Riding dispatch, I have the right to give U.S. script. 
- You loved her? 
- l don't know. 
I needed her. 
- But if she was dark and I'm fair... 
- Why you reminded me of her? 
- Yes. 
- l don't know. 
I thought about it. 
You don't look anything like her. 
I am fully aware that I am a homely woman, Mr. Lane. 
I didn't mean that. 
I have a bad habit of telling the truth. 
But being pretty isn't much. 
I know a lot of pretty people I wouldn't trust with a busted nickel-plated watch. 
But some others, something comes out of the inside of them and you know you can trust them. 
Destarte had that. 
And you've got it, too. 
- I'm a married woman. 
- l thought about that, too. 
I guess I kissed you because you remind me of Destarte. 
Or maybe it was because I hate to think of your hair hanging from the center pole of an Apache wickiup. 
Well, a long time ago I made me a rule. 
I let people do what they want to do. 
Sam! 
You are a strange man, Mr. Lane. 
I don't know about that. 
Goodbye, Mrs. Lowe. 
- You are Vittorio. 
- l am Vittorio. 
Your horses have been watered here. 
- You were told to go. 
- l couldn't leave. 
My husband is away, and I didn't think that I... 
Your people water their horses here. 
You leave my mother alone. 
Stop him! 
Stop him! 
- l ain't scared of you. 
- You're not fear Apache? 
No. 
He fear hurt to mother, but not death to self. 
He brave. 
Like Apache boy. 
Him now blood brother. 
I call him Small Warrior. 
Him belong Moon Dog Lodge, Chiricahua Apache. 
You care for him well. 
You now mother Chiricahua warrior. 
Live safely here. 
I hope someday, someone befriends your sons. 
My sons are dead. 
White man kill them. 
Figured your scalp would be hanging in some Apache wickiup by now. 
- Hi, Buffalo. 
- Been making bets on it. 
You're sure a disappointment to me, Hondo. 
You like to win your bet. 
I wore out some horses. 
You wore out you while you was at it. 
Here, let me get that. 
Where's that water? 
- Looks like I won a bet, Buffalo. 
- Hi, Dick. 
Yeah, I owe you a jug of red-eye. 
- This feels good. 
- There's times when water is good. 
That's exactly what I mean. 
I say I got a right to talk to this here bow-necked Major, 
- l don't talk to no underlings. 
- Major's asleep. 
That's just too bad about him. 
I'm a citizen and I want to see him. 
Major ain't had any sleep for three days. 
I can tell you everything just as well as he can. 
We ain't heard nothing from up north. 
If you ask me, the Cavalry's scared of Vittorio. I think the U.S. Cavalry... I am greatly interested in your opinion of the United States Cavalry. 
Continue, Mr... 
Whatever your name is. 
The Cavalry is supposed to support the settlers. 
I've got some cattle up north, I don't intend... 
C troop is making a sweep to the north to escort out any settlers they may find. 
C troop is now over a week late in returning. That's all I can tell you. 
C troop isn't coming back. 
I'd be obliged, sir, if you would leave. 
A fine business, the whole territory... 
- Sergeant! 
- Get! 
Get out of the way, you mangy... lf that's your cur, get him out of the way. 
Walk around him. 
I'll be hanged if I go out of my way for any cur dog. 
A man ought to do what he thinks is best. 
Quit blocking the door. 
Where did you get this? 
- Half a day's ride south of Twin Buttes. 
- How? 
Took it off a couple of Indians, Apaches. 
Running Dog Lodge of the Mescaleros. 
Mescaleros are up, too. 
That makes all the Apache lodges. 
Say, while I was south, did any settlers get in from the north basin? 
A few, the last couple of weeks. 
Handsome woman, fair, with a boy about six? 
No, mostly middle-aged or elderly people. 
Get some sleep, Lane, use my tent. 
Thank you. 
While you're sleeping, I'll move your possibles over to my tent. 
Pete Britton was scouting with C troop. 
Wintered with old Pete once up on the Divide. 
Ornery cuss. 
Them Indians you took that pennant offen. 
- Dead Indians? 
- Finally. 
- Hi, Pete. 
- Hi, Hondo. 
Broke my heart when I heard you made it. 
Your pap know you started out against this so-called whiskey? 
I ain't seen him for a month. 
I know you haven't. 
Come here, I got a message for you. 
Leave him be, Hondo, I can't make no money scouting. 
Aw, these other fellows'll excuse you. 
Come on over at the bar. 
I won't. 
I'm out almost $ 100. 
- That figures, with Buffalo in the game. 
- Wait a minute. 
These shirts are hard to come by. 
- What'd you hit me for? 
-' Cause I know you. 
Leather it. 
No, don't leather it. 
No wonder them Apaches call him Emberato. 
- What does it mean? 
- Bad temper. 
I should've let him shoot you. 
That's the second time I've tangled with that mouthy no-good... 
- What's his name? 
- Calls himself Lowe, Ed Lowe. 
Johnny. 
Johnny! 
Hi, Mommy. 
Vittorio says I'll make a good Apache. 
I thought... 
I didn't know he was with you, I didn't hear anything. 
- Apache no make noise. 
- Look what he gave me. 
- It is lodge token. His. 
- It's very pretty, thank you. 
He will ride well. 
And he no afraid. 
- l speak with your mother, go to house. 
- Yes, Vittorio. 
Lodge should have man. 
- My husband will be home any day now. 
- l no think so. 
I think he dead. 
Small Warrior should have father. 
See, Sergeant, just like I told you. 
That's my horse, all right. 
Got my brand on it." E.L." Ed Lowe. 
What he says true? 
- Yeah, that's his horse. 
- Where'd you get him? 
From his ranch, that's where I'm taking him back. 
That's where he can pick him up. 
But that's Indian territory, strict orders against any Whites going in there. 
You know something, Joe, I got a bad ear. I can't hear a thing you're saying. 
Aren't you gonna prefer charges against him? 
He may be a mean, ornery, son-of-anything-you-wanna-call-him, but he ain't no horse thief. 
And I'm not gonna call him one, to his face or his back. 
You stay here. 
I thought the Apache were always silent. 
Not when they seek squaw. 
You pick one. 
What? 
It's not good for Small Warrior to be without father to teach him how to be man. 
This is the one I was calling Emiliano. 
Very brave, has taken many scalps. 
He has six horses, and two squaws, but one old and will soon die. 
He's good hunter. 
Never hungry, his wickiup. 
This is one who is called Kloori. 
He has ten horses, one squaw. 
Sachito, brave warrior, many horses. 
Not much beat squaws, sings very loud. 
- Boy, go stand by my horse. 
- Yes, Vittorio. 
Small Warrior never to see tears, Apache does not weep. 
Chief, you can't make me do this, I'm married. 
You are fool, your man dead. 
Soon come planting rain. 
If your man come home by then, good. 
If not, you take Apache brave. 
Remember, time of planting rain. 
He's getting kind of deep into Indian territory. And so are we. 
What are you squawking for? 
You're getting well paid. 
He'll be making camp pretty soon. 
Don't get a chance at him then, we'll turn back. 
Quiet, Sam, I hear them. 
Come on, Sam. 
That's his camp, all right. 
Rifle's gone, must be out looking for camp meat. 
- You're all right, you're not hurt bad. 
- This tintype saved me. 
That did it. 
Now, every Apache between us and the ranch will be alerted. 
They'll have us cut off. 
No, there's nobody between us and Fort Seddon. 
Beat it, Sam! 
- White man understand Apache. 
- A little. 
He know now how he die. 
Your coup stick shows many scalps. 
Yes, many. 
Soon, you. 
Man's scalp would look out of place there. 
You took all yours from squaws, papoose, and dogs. 
Your lodge should be real proud of you. 
You will take long time die. 
Where are soldiers, White man? 
- How many? 
- l don't know, Vittorio. 
You know my name? 
I saw you once at the Treaty Council at Fort Meade. 
The treaty. 
The treaty was like rustle of wind to White man. 
- Now you tell, where are soldiers? 
- This, I do not know. 
- Hat. Soldier hat. 
- l was once a soldier. 
Why you here Apache land? 
This is for me to know. 
I'm told you speak insults to this one of my chiefs. 
The cougar screams insults and is brave. 
A coyote howls insults and is a coward. 
We shall see. 
Cougar or coyote. 
You will die bravely in silence, or you will wail like woman bringing forth child and cry out to us where pony-soldiers are. 
He claims the blood right, you understand? 
You mean, he says I shot his brother? 
I understand. 
So that life may ebb cleanly. 
Forget your blood right or join your brother. 
You think you buy your life now? 
I don't think. 
You may live or die, we see. 
Indians. 
Is this your man? 
Speak, is this your man? 
- Yes, this is my husband. 
- White man, you lived with the Apache, that's good. 
You know how Small Warrior should be taught that, he be honored son of wickiup of one who's called Vittorio. 
Watch like the hawk, be patient as the beaver, brave as puma, that he may learn well. 
Know it, then, or your dying will be long before you welcome death. 
- More coffee? 
- No, thanks. 
- What are you gonna do? 
- Gonna fix up your shirt. 
Not before I show you something. 
- Did Ed give you this? 
- l took it off his body. 
He's dead. 
Tried to tell you before. 
Funny, I'm not surprised. 
Perhaps because I knew all along, just wouldn't admit it to myself. 
- Hi, Emberato, you didn't die, did you? 
- Hello, Johnny. 
Be careful. 
I wanna show you something, Emberato. 
My Indian emblem. 
Vittorio gave it to me, didn't he, Mom? 
- He's taken a great liking to Johnny. 
- Probably saved your life and mine. 
Indians place great value on male children. 
They also place a great value on dying well. 
Did Ed die well? 
I keep it under my pillow. 
He died well. 
When Johnny's old enough, when he has to be told, it will make him proud. 
Here it is, Emberato. 
I'm a chief now. 
Isn't it wonderful? 
- Isn't it? 
- Yes, Johnny. 
- Where's your mother? 
- Picking watercress. 
- Any luck? 
- Not a bite this morning. 
See where the sun is? - Up there. 
- Yeah, on the back of your neck. 
You're casting a shadow. 
If you can see it, the fish can see it. 
Always fish with the sun in your face. 
The other bank's the place. 
- That is, if you want my opinion. 
- Gosh, Emberato, I want your opinion. 
But Mama won't let me go over there. 
- Why not? 
- l can't swim. 
- You can't what? 
- l can't swim. 
- How old are you? - Six. 
Help him, he can't swim. 
Time he learned. 
Everybody should swim. 
Just reach out in front of you and grab a handful of water. 
Pull it back towards you. 
Not too fast. 
That's the way I learned. 
- l did it, Emberato, I did it. 
- Good. 
- How will he get back? 
- Swim. 
Well, he might drown. 
- Well, then, you go get him. 
- l can't swim, either. 
Angie, there's something I've got to tell you. 
- And it isn't going to be easy. 
- Then don't say it yet. 
Just look at the moon. 
How odd it looks in this quarter. 
When I was a child, my mother used to tell me it was a teeter-totter. 
You know, the tilted plank a child plays on. 
I suppose the Indians have a word for it. 
Yeah, bermarga. 
It's the planting moon. 
Indians won't plant their corn unless the moon's like that. 
You liked living with the Apache, didn't you? 
Angie, I've just got to tell you this. 
I'm not much for lying. 
The last time I was here, before Vittorio brought me? 
Yes. 
I rode dispatch some after that, then came to Seddon. 
There was trouble. 
I killed a man. 
Stay still. 
Somebody in those willows. 
Don't shoot, White man. 
Small Warrior has knife. 
He sleeps with it. 
- You were in the house? 
- In house. 
Wickiup empty place without sons. 
Mine empty wickiup. 
You better tell that brave back at the creek bank not to walk in the water. 
I almost killed him a few minutes ago. 
Almost threw a shot at him. 
He very young. 
Will learn. 
- lf he lives. 
- You are Apache. 
Now, hear me, pony-soldiers are near. 
Soon will be fought remembered fight. 
They will come here first. 
- You will not go with them, White man. 
- l will not. 
Leader of pony-soldiers will question you. 
You will say you have seen Apache trailing to the west. 
This I won't do. 
- You will not? 
- l will not. 
You have good man, treasure him. 
They're mounting up now down by the butte. 
I don't hear a thing. 
There's eight of them I'd say, or maybe nine. 
There's something in those trees. 
That's a squirrel. 
Our talking woke him up. 
He's put out. 
There's nine of them. 
I love you. 
I suppose I shouldn't have said that, with my husband dead so short a time. 
I don't guess people's hearts got anything to do with a calendar. 
You were so wonderful, refusing to lie for Vittorio. 
He was testing me. 
Indians hate lies. 
And I guess I got to feel the same way, but, once in a while a fella's got to lie if it'll make it easier on someone else. 
Troop, halt! 
Prepare to dismount. 
Dismount! 
Madam and sir, may I present myself? 
Lt. McKay, Troop D, 8th cavalry. 
- Hi, Hondo, you old cabin robber. 
- Hi, Buff. 
Lieutenant, this here is Hondo Lane. 
He's scouted some and ridden dispatch some for the cavalry. 
- l don't reckon I know this here lady. 
- This is Ms. Lowe, Lieutenant. 
You people are lucky. 
Obviously, Vittorio and his renegade band just happened not to find this hidden valley. 
- Vittorio's been here lots. 
- And you lived? 
One lone man stood off Vittorio? 
No lone man stands off the Apache. 
He lets us live here. 
There are almost 1 00 dead settlers in the basin, scalped by this cowardly criminal. 
Vittorio may be a criminal by the books, I don't know. 
But if he's a coward, it hasn't showed up yet. 
- Amen, brother. 
- l must disagree with you, Mr. Lane. 
He's run before us for 200 miles. 
Indians have a story they tell their young ones about a hunter who chased a wild cat until he caught it. 
Then it was the other way around. 
The story goes back further than the Indians. 
It's originally attributed to the first Roman army to enter Tartary. 
The soldier caught a Tartar and yelled out. 
The officer called back for him to come in with his prisoner. 
And he replied," The Tartar won't let me." 
That was one of the favorite stories of Col Mays, who teaches cavalry tactics at the Point. 
The story is world-wide. 
How long have you been out of that school, Lieutenant? 
Graduated class' 69, sir. 
This is' 70, ain't it? 
I just can't seem to keep up with the years. 
I meant to get a calendar, but then I forget. 
Say, who's President of these United States now? 
Ulysses S. Grant. 
You know, I voted once. I was down in Independence around voting time. 
And a fellow come up to me and offered me $ 2 if I'd vote for a man named Taylor. 
And I was drinking, drinking a little at the time. 
And I... The $ 2 didn't last... 
Mrs. Lowe, Mr. Lane, my orders are to make a sweep as far as Twin Buttes. 
My men'll bivouac here tonight. 
We'll go on to Twin Buttes tomorrow, return tomorrow night to escort you and your boy out to safety. 
If you'll excuse me, madam, I must see that my men are properly encamped. 
Very nice and very young. 
He for doggone sure is, ma'am. 
- How long you been out on this patrol? 
- This is the 20th day. 
We've rounded up about eight families back there, that's all there are left. 
We're gonna pick them up on the way out. 
There've been many a scalp took, Hondo. 
- You know where Vittorio is, don't you? 
- l do. This boy Lieutenant's gonna get you killed. 
Us scouts has got to get these young officers educated. 
Johnny, go in and set out the plates for me. 
Hondo, if your friend would like to eat with us, Mr... 
Buffalo? 
Mr... 
I've known you for 8 or 1 0 years. 
You must have a last name. 
Well, of course I got a last name, what do you think I am? 
I know what you are, but there's a lady present. 
Mrs. Lowe, my name is Baker. 
That's what it is, Buffalo Baker. 
Well, you may eat with us then, Mr. Baker, and wash. 
There's a basin on the bench and a towel on the jug, and soap. 
You know, there is something about this place... 
- l know what it reminds me of. 
- My ranch. 
In California. 
I shot a deer right off your front porch on a butte just like that. 
With a crick down below and the mesas all spreading out. 
Made me pack it back. 
- You have a place that looks like this? 
- East of San Dimas. 
How wonderful. 
You're getting to where you kind of take to that water. 
Every time I wash my face I think of you and that night at Seddon's, when you whacked me. 
You busted off a jaw tooth, and it got to hurting so bad I had to go to the barber and have him dig out the rest of it. 
Did I catch you that day, I'd have set your sun. 
That's the last morning you'd ever seen. 
" Hondo Lane, first prize, Winchester Arms." 
Always liked this rifle of yours. 
Always wanted one of the new issue myself. 
Keep your hands off it. 
I've known him 1 0 years, and he's never spoken a friendly word to me. 
- l don't like you. 
- Figured that. 
But now I figure is how he might admire to give me that rifle. 
You see, about a half day out of Seddon, I come across some bodies. 
One of them was this here lady's husband. 
There was a lot of horse tracks around there. 
Some of them belonged to that there chestnut you were riding. 
That one with the cast-off horseshoe. 
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice little set-up you got yourself here. 
Nice ranch. Pretty woman. 
You could get yourself killed talking like this. 
Or I could get that new-fashioned Winchester since he bushwhacked this lady's husband. 
Did she know that, I figure she wouldn't look at him like he was the high cockalorum of every tribe from here to Salt Water. 
Hondo. 
I tried to tell you. 
Mrs. Lowe, we're ready to leave. 
Mr. Lane? 
- Stridon. 
- Yes, sir. 
- Form the troops, column of twos. 
- Yes, sir. 
I want you to accompany us as far as Twin Buttes. 
Haven't any time to lose, so I'd be obliged if you'd saddle up. 
- I'm not going. 
- You're not going? - That's right. 
- But why? 
- Gave my word. 
- Your word to whom? 
- Vittorio. 
- Surely a word given to an 
- Indian desperado wouldn't be... 
- Mister, when I give my word, I keep it. 
Now I'll give you a piece of advice, there's only one family between here and Twin Buttes, and you're too late to do them any good. 
So you better gather up what settlers you have and hightail it out of here. 
Sir, I have my orders, and these orders will be executed. 
Ma'am. 
Prepare to mount. 
Mount. 
Forward, ho! 
- Angie. 
- l can't talk now. I have to think. 
I'll put your things outside. 
- Before I go I want to explain something. 
- Yes? 
It didn't happen in the low way you heard it. 
- l didn't bushwhack. 
- l never for a moment thought you did. 
- But you killed him. 
- l didn't have any choice, 
- he cut loose at me... 
- l should have known that. 
I should have known you were lying to make me think well of him. 
Poor Ed. l guess he wasn't the sort of man to die well. 
Sorry now I hated him so much. 
I guess he couldn't help being weak and selfish. 
- l just didn't have any choice. 
- l know that. 
You're gonna feel differently about me? 
No one has any control over the way they feel. 
I'm never going to change the way I feel about you. 
But, what about him? 
Yeah. 
Guess there are some things that just can't... 
He's gonna be a good man. 
Good spread to his shoulders. 
Head works, too. 
Other night, after you went to sleep, he crawled up into my bunk and put his arms around my neck. 
Made me feel kind of funny. 
Like he was depending on me. 
Lot of things I'd rather do than this. 
You're going to tell him? 
If I don't, somebody else will. 
And I got a belly full of lies. 
Look what I got! 
- Hold him by the gills like I showed you. 
- Sure. 
- Johnny, I want to tell you something. 
- It's a nice perch, ain't it? 
Bass. 
Remember the shape of its head? 
Oh yeah, I forgot. 
Bass have a jaw that stick out like this. 
What I wanted to tell you is, while back, a man came at me with a gun. 
- l had to kill him. 
- Good. 
Indian? 
No, he was a white man, Johnny, but I didn't have any choice. 
He... I told you to press down on the shank, and then you won't stick yourself. 
Won't break the hook, either. 
That's the way Indian youngsters learn not to cry. Here, bite down on this stick. 
- Johnny, this man I killed... 
- No! 
Your ranch in California, it's far, too far for gossip to travel. 
Go wrap your thumb in some bayberry leaves. 
You and your silly ideals. 
You think truth is the most important thing. 
- It's the measure of a man. 
- Not for a woman. 
A man can afford to have noble sentiments and poses. 
But a woman only has the man she marries. 
That's her truth. 
And if he's no good, that's still her truth. 
I married a man who was a liar, a thief, and a coward. 
He was a drunkard and unfaithful. 
He only married me to get this ranch, and then he deserted Johnny and me for good. 
And that's your fine truth for you. 
- Could I bring Johnny up on that? 
- No, I guess you couldn't. 
And then you come along and you're good and fine, and everything that Ed could never hope to be. 
And now, with your vanity, you want to spoil Johnny's chances, and mine? 
- Varlebena. 
- What? 
When the Indians wind up their squaw-seeking ceremony, they only say one word. 
Varlebena. 
It means forever. 
Forever. 
Well, we caught the wild cat. 
Give us a hand, will you? 
I can't understand, we killed him on the last charge. 
Vittorio? 
They had us surrounded. 
Could've cut us to pieces, then they withdrew. 
That's why they pulled out. 
Anytime their leader is killed, that means their medicine's bad. 
- This poor child. 
- We're going out with this troop. 
- Vittorio's dead. 
- No, he can't be. 
Everybody gets dead, it was his turn. 
Now get your possibles. 
I have some medicine in the cabin. 
Thank you, Mrs. Lowe, I'd be eternally grateful if you'd pass among the men first. 
No, you're wounded, I'm going to fix you up. 
Thank you, ma'am. The men are in worse shape than I am. 
Come on, do as he says. 
We'll take care of him. 
- Sergeant. 
- Yes, sir? 
Dismount the men. 
- Hitch their horses up to the wagon. 
- Yes, sir. 
You'll find harness in the barn. 
Len. 
- What do you want? 
- Take four men and gather the settlers. 
We'll probably catch up with you at Errad Crossing. 
Wilson, McGrath, Lyon, Johnson. 
- How is he? 
- He'll make out. 
Don't know much. 
Led us into an ambush. 
But I ain't ashamed of him nohow. 
Bullet holes are in the front of him. 
All those youngsters from the Point are like that. 
They got to learn. 
Partly they learn, partly they die. 
But I gotta float my stick same as you. 
I never saw one of them I had to be ashamed of. 
Join in and keep moving. 
Move it along, there! 
Hurry up! 
Come on, move along here! 
Come on, hurry it up. Hurry it up! 
Circle the wagons! 
Wheel her around. 
Hold on! 
Stay in the wagon. 
Keep everybody in the wagons. 
And don't unhitch. 
Hondo! 
All this circle's doing is protect the horses. 
And stay here? 
That's what they expect. 
We gotta do what they don't expect. 
That's why all the heavy artillery's in Buffalo's wagon. 
Buffalo! 
Lieutenant, get down. 
Are you ready, Buff? 
- l was born ready. 
- Let's go. 
Circle the wagons. 
Close up. 
Stay down! 
Sergeant! 
- l don't want to be an Apache, Mama. 
- Now, you be quiet. 
We're going to get out all right. 
Now, help me, hurry. 
- Ready again, Buff? 
- As I told you, I was born ready. 
Throw me your knife. 
Get out of here! 
All right, Hondo! 
They're not following. 
Leader's dead. 
They'll powwow and pick a new one. 
We're out of trouble if we get a move on. 
And am I going to get to drive? 
Before we get to San Dimas, you'll be a top teamster, son. 
- How are you, Lieutenant? 
- Fine, thanks to you. 
And you're all right, thanks to Lennie. 
He shot that Indian offen your back. 
- Thanks. 
- With your rifle. 
It's his. 
Don't look like we'll be needing it much more today. 
General Crook will be here within a month with a large force. 
- That'll be the end of the Apache. 
- Yeah. 
End of a way of life. 
Too bad, it's a good way. 
Wagons forward! 
- Hello, Ed. 
- Where's Doc Holliday? 
Over at the hotel, more than likely. 
He's been expecting you... 
- Get word over there I'm waiting for him. 
- No need to do that, Ed. 
The whole town knows you're waiting for him by now. 
Before there's another killing... 
You just go on serving your watered-down liquor and keep out of my business, Shanssey. 
Your brother came in here stinking drunk, spoiling for a fight. 
- He drew a gun on Holliday. 
- Whiskey, over there. 
Have it your way, Ed. 
Check your guns if you want to stay here. 
Leave the bottle. 
You don't stand a chance, Doc. 
Bailey brought two men with him. 
Oh, come on, honey, let's cut out of here while there's still time. 
The whole town, including that no-good marshal, is laying for you. 
Right or wrong, they're gonna hang you for another killing. 
You know it. 
Doc. 
Oh, you ain't even listening to me. 
Now, Kate, Mr Bailey came all the way from Fort Worth 
- to see me on a gentleman's matter. 
- Gentleman! 
It wouldn't be hospitable for me to leave town now, would it? 
Oh, don't start that gentleman business with me again. 
I mean, it's a pure case of ethics, but... 
Well, that's something a person like you wouldn't understand. 
Why do you always have to treat me like I'm dirt? 
You ain't no better than me! 
- That's debatable. 
- Oh, is it? 
You and that magnolia dripping! 
Let me tell you something, Doc Holliday. 
All them fancy clothes and that smart talk don't make you no gentleman. 
You are dirt, just like me. 
And I'm tired of hearing about that Georgia plantation and all them lily-white friends of yours! 
They're all gone now! 
They're all gone! 
Yes, they are. 
Here I am with you. 
Your family scraped the barrel after the war wiped them out just to send you through dental school. 
You sure turned out fine. 
They'd be real proud of you. 
Don't you ever mention my family again. 
Please! 
Doc, please! 
Forget about Bailey. 
Let's get out of here while there's still time. 
Maybe we could even go to Laredo like you said, and do something about that cough of yours. 
It's getting worse all the time. Your concern over my health touches me deeply. 
- You know how I feel about you. 
- I know exactly how you feel. 
I don't know... 
I don't know what I'd do if anything happened to you. 
You'd lose your meal ticket, wouldn't you? 
That ain't nice to say to me, Doc. 
I've been good to you, ain't I? 
Why don't you think about me once in a while? 
All right, get over to Shanssey's and tell him I'll be there later. 
- Oh, please don't go there. 
- Do as I tell you. 
I need some money. 
Hello, Wyatt. 
Cotton Wilson. 
Been a long time. 
Man, I'm plain wore out. 
Hope you got some good news for me. 
Ike Clanton rode through here three days ago, heading east. 
Waco, I think. 
Johnny Ringo was with him. 
Rode through heading east? 
You didn't get my telegram. 
I got it. 
Well, why didn't you hold him? 
I had no quarrel with Ike Clanton, nothing to hold him for. 
Nothing to hold him for? 
Why, man, he's got a dozen charges against him. 
I played this whole thing so he'd be forced into Griffin. 
I figured if there was one man in Texas who could stop him, you'd be the man. 
Now don't go getting your blood heated up, Wyatt. 
Cotton, it's Wyatt Earp you're talking to. 
Ten years ago I watched you walk single-handed into a saloon in Oklahoma City and knock out three of the fastest guns in the territory. 
Ten years is a long time ago. 
Getting old, I guess. 
Anybody ever told me that Cotton Wilson had gone yellow, 
I'd have called him a liar. 
You've got no right to say that to me, Wyatt. 
I've bucked heads with the toughest gangs on the frontier. 
Then why didn't you stop Ringo and Clanton? 
Well, why didn't you? 
If you can't handle it anymore, turn in your badge! 
Turn in my badge. 
I've been a lawman for 25 years, worked every hellhole in the territory. 
You know what I got to show for it? 
A $ 12-a-month room in the back of a cruddy boarding house and a tin star. 
Think I like winding up in a place like this? 
It's the end of the line for me, Wyatt. 
It'll happen to you some day, just like it happens to all of us. 
- And where is that yellow-livered skunk? 
- Slow down, Ed. 
Holliday's only trying to rile you. 
- What do you figure's keeping Holliday? 
- Doc's gonna make him dangle a little. 
Wyatt Earp! 
Why you old son of a gun! 
Why didn't you let us know you was riding into town? 
- Good to see you, John. 
- Hi, Marshal. 
Come on, sit down. 
Cigar? 
I'll be a son of a gun. 
You've sure come a long way since the railroading days in Cheyenne. 
Ellsworth, Wichita and now Dodge City. 
Funny, I never figured you for a lawman. 
You was always pretty reckless and wild. 
I never figured myself for a lawman, either. 
- Fix a nice steak for Mr Earp. 
- Yes, sir. 
My personal stock. 
- How are the brothers? 
- Fine. 
- Virgil and Morgan are married. 
- Virgil and Morgan married? 
What do you know. 
- John, I need some help. 
- Anything I can do for you. 
Ike Clanton and Johnny Ringo rode through here three days ago. 
They got a dozen counts against them. 
I telegraphed Cotton to hold them, but he crossed me up. 
- Cotton's skidded a long way. 
- Do you know anything? 
I wish I did, but... 
Wait a minute, wait a minute. 
Doc Holliday played poker with him. 
Maybe he heard something. 
Bartender! 
Bartender! 
Let's have some decent whiskey around here! 
Ed Bailey. 
Doc Holliday killed his brother. 
The guy was begging for it. 
He came in drunk, cheated at cards, he pulled a gun on Doc. 
Did you ever meet Holliday? 
We crossed trails once. 
He was a dentist then. 
You know, I've yet to see the guy pick a fight. 
Trouble just naturally seems to find him. 
It's gotten so every would-be gunman on the frontier wants the honour of putting him in Boot Hill. 
You know how it is when a man gets a reputation. 
I sure do. 
Where is Holliday? 
I better get to him while the getting's good. 
He's at the hotel. 
- Keep that steak warm. I'll be back. 
- You ain't missing much. 
It's longhorn. 
Holliday? 
Sit down, make yourself at home. 
Just like you were invited. 
- I don't know if you remember me... 
- I remember you. 
Wyatt Earp. 
Pulled a tooth for you 10 years ago. 
If I knew when I had you in the chair what you were gonna turn out to be, I... 
I hear you've taken up a new occupation. 
- It's too bad, you were a good dentist. 
- My patients didn't like my coughing. 
I'd like some information. 
The name of this game is solitaire. 
I'm in a position to do a little horse-trading. 
Good evening, Mr Earp. 
I know something that would interest you. 
You don't know a thing that would interest me. 
Suppose I was to tell you that Ed Bailey has a small derringer hidden in his boot? 
- Left or right? 
- Left. 
I'd say that was good information. 
Bailey's left-handed. 
Ike Clanton and Johnny Ringo rode through here three days ago. 
You played cards with them. 
- Which way were they heading? 
- Beats me. 
I thought we were making a deal. That's what you said. 
I didn't make any deals. 
But you know where they went, don't you? 
Look, you're interrupting my game. 
Got a real big hate for the law, haven't you? 
There any reason why I shouldn't? 
Your brother Morgan ran me out of Deadwood last year and impounded $ 10,000 of my money. 
As a matter of fact, you've got brothers marshalling all over the frontier, haven't you? 
I'll see you again, Holliday, if you're around. 
- What did you find out? 
- Not a thing. 
It's my hunch they headed for Tombstone. 
Ike's old man has a big ranch there, but I can't be sure. 
Isn't your brother Virgil a marshal at Tombstone? 
That's right. 
I sent him a telegram asking him to be on the lookout for them just in case. 
- What are you gonna do? 
- There's nothing I can do. 
The trail's ice cold. 
I'm heading back for Dodge City in the morning. 
- Oh, Mr Holliday. 
- Yes? 
Would you care to settle up your bill now? 
What I mean, sir, is we didn't know whether you were checking out or not. 
You'll have word in 15 minutes. 
Doc, you're walking into a stacked deck. 
If Bailey don't get you, the marshal will. 
You'd be smart to get out while you can. 
You act as if you want to get killed. 
Maybe I do. 
Holliday, let's check your gun. 
Evening, Harry. 
Usual. 
Yes, sir. 
I understand there's a gentleman in from Fort Worth to see me. 
This gentleman should have taught his brother better than to deal with a marked deck. 
Well, if you happen to see this gentleman, tell him I'll be waiting for him at Boot Hill. 
He'll have only one direction to travel from there, down. 
Come to think of it, he's no gentleman at all. 
All right, Doc, let's go. 
Right on cue. 
What's the charge? 
- We'll think of one. 
- I'm sure you will. 
Thanks, Harry. 
All right, get him out of here. 
It's all over, folks. 
Break it up. 
Come on, step up to the bar. 
Free drinks on the house! 
Come on, give me some beer, bartender. 
It's always a mess after a killing. 
Looks like Doc spoiled everybody's fun. 
He's crazy, but he's got nerve though, plenty of nerve. 
Shanssey! 
Mr Earp! 
What are you gonna do about this? 
You saw what happened. 
They had no right to take Doc off. 
They're gonna do something to him. 
I know it. 
Kate Fisher, friend of Doc's. 
He's gonna be framed. 
You saw it. 
Bailey pulled a gun on him. 
Wait a minute, Miss Fisher. Take it easy. 
Why don't you just relax and let the law handle this? 
There ain't no law in this town. 
I never saw a man beg more to get his brains blown out. 
Please, you gotta help him. 
- Doc Holliday is none of my business. - Please, mister. 
I don't want any part of him. 
I don't even like him. 
I'm sorry. 
Good night. 
Kate, I can have a pair of saddle horses put' round back of the hotel. 
That's as much as I can do. 
With the feeling against Doc, 
I wouldn't stay in business 10 minutes if they knew I'd helped him. 
Ten, please. 
- Wilson live here? 
- Why, no, sir. 
They're just holding Doc Holliday upstairs in his room. 
Oh. 
- Mr Earp? 
- Look, Miss Fisher, 
I told you this is none of my business. 
I don't care what you think of me and Doc. 
There's a lynch mob starting across the street. 
That's your business, ain't it? 
Don't make no difference whether Doc is right or wrong. 
He don't deserve to be hung by a pack of animals! 
You're getting out of here. 
Since when have you taken to rescuing gamblers in distress? 
Don't take it personal, Doc. 
I just don't like lynchings. 
- What are we waiting for? 
- Not yet. 
I'd say now is a very good time. 
Hey, George's barn! 
Get the buckets! 
That's it. 
Get going down the back stairs. 
Much obliged, Marshal. 
I'll see you in Dodge City and thank you properly. 
You can thank me properly by staying out of Dodge City. 
More water! 
More water! 
Whoa! 
How about that? 
Can you take me to Mrs Deeds' boarding house? 
- Yes, ma'am. 
- I have a trunk and a bag. 
Little out of place for Dodge City, wouldn't you say? 
That's strictly big-city stuff. 
Looks like she's going to stay a while. 
Got a trunk. 
I gotta go on a posse. 
That's what I came to see you about. 
Chief Dull Knife is on a rampage again. 
I'm gonna have to borrow your deputies. 
You're always short of men. 
- Who's the girl? 
- Yeah, who's the girl? 
Girl? 
What girl? 
I was too busy finding out that Doc Holliday and his lady friend have just checked in at the Dodge House. 
Doc Holliday? 
I told him to keep out of Dodge City. 
I'd better get over there before he unpacks. 
- You gonna lend me your deputies? 
- Well, all right, but I'll have to keep Charlie here with me. 
- Giddap! 
- You can have the rest of the boys. 
Don't forget to get back before those cattle drives. 
You know how business picks up when the cowpokes hit town. 
Mario, go on out and get some fresh air. 
The Mayor's Welcoming Committee, huh? 
I thought I told you to stay out of Dodge City. 
I like a sharp razor, don't you? 
Care for a shave? 
There's a stage for Abilene in the morning. 
I want you to be on it. 
Can't. 
The Marshal of Abilene sent me here. 
As a matter of fact, I wish someone would write you fellows a new speech. 
I've had the same one in the last five towns. 
All right, you'll stay in your hotel room then, till day after tomorrow. 
I'll personally escort you to the westbound train. 
Wyatt, we've got to face a hard fact. 
I'm in a state of complete financial collapse. 
I don't even have the price of a ticket. 
Shanssey told me you had quite a bankroll back there in Griffin. 
Shanssey ought to know. 
He had $ 10,000 of mine in his safe. 
You know what that son of a gun did? 
You recall I had to leave town rather hastily. 
Those two horses in back of the hotel cost me $ 5,000 apiece. 
Now how about that? 
Towel, please. 
Oh, thank you. 
Everyone puts such an outlandish value on my life. 
Say, Wyatt, how much do you earn? 
About $ 100 a month and $ 2 an arrest? 
- You trying to bribe me? 
- Oh, no. 
Not you. 
I feel compelled to offer you an honest business proposition. 
That's not bad. 
- You got any money saved? 
- Some. 
Gonna buy a small ranch or a country store some day, huh? 
Well, I'll make it easy for you. 
You stake me to $ 1,000 and I'll split my winnings. 
The cowboys are coming and the stakes will be big. 
50-50, huh? 
Now, actually, any number of people would be glad to back me for 10 %, but I like you, Wyatt Earp. 
I like your cut. 
Why so generous with the split? 
Look, a barber needs this. 
You're a lawman, you need a gun. 
I'm a gambler. 
Money's just a tool of my trade. 
Of course, you will guarantee you won't lose. 
I never lose. 
You see, poker's played by desperate men who cherish money. 
I don't lose because I have nothing to lose, including my life. 
Is it a deal? 
Of all the low-down gall. 
Well, you're just gonna have to stake me to a railroad ticket. 
Holliday, I've done some foolish things in my life. 
I'm about to do another. 
I'm gonna let you stay in town. 
Why so generous? 
Let's say I like your cut. 
You can stay and you can play on one condition. 
No knives, no guns and no killings. 
- No knives, no guns, no killings. 
- That's it. 
- You have my word as a gentleman. 
- Just one more thing. 
You ought to treat that woman decent or leave her. 
Kate? 
Yes, poor old Kate. 
She stands for everything I hate in Doc Holliday. 
Oh, leave two bits for the barber, will you? 
Well, I found out all about your lady fair. 
- Hey, where'd you get the new gun? 
- Buntline made it for me special. 
- What lady fair? 
- Sure beautiful. 
- Isn't that barrel too long? 
- No, good balance. Just right. 
- What's beautiful? 
- Hand-tooled, too, huh? 
What are you talking about? 
Well, that girl that came in on the stage day before yesterday. 
Oh, yeah, I remember. What about her? 
Well, she's staying over at Mrs Deeds' place. 
They tell me she's got a trunk full of the most elegant clothes you've ever seen. 
Some of them dresses clean from Paris, France. 
She's 5' 6", weighs 120 pounds, red hair... 
- What is she doing here? 
- Gambler. 
Very funny. 
Well, if you think that's funny, why don't you take a little walk over to the Long Branch Saloon? 
You'll die laughing. 
Hello, Wyatt. 
What's the trouble? 
Kelly, I'm gonna have to break up that game. 
Can't do that, Wyatt. 
There's no law against women gambling. 
I know, but every time there's a woman at the tables, there's trouble. 
You know that. 
Sorry, game's over. 
- Wyatt, this is Laura Denbow. 
- Kelly, you're the mayor of this town. 
We agreed there'd be no women gambling on the north side. 
Miss Denbow's marker is respected for $ 10,000 anywhere in the West. 
- We all consider her an exception. 
- Not in Dodge City, she isn't. 
So you're the famous Wyatt Earp, lawman, judge and jury. 
That's right, Miss Gambler. 
Start with you and we'll have every tramp on the south side over here. 
Who's a tramp? 
- Shut up and keep out of this, cowboy. 
- You're talking to a lady! 
It appears the marshal hasn't met a lady before. 
You're in a saloon, playing a man's game. 
- Why should you be treated like a lady? 
- And you ain't no gentleman. 
- That's all for tonight, Miss Denbow. 
- Take your hands off her! 
Hold it, Charlie. 
I'm tired of you pushing people around. 
Now go for your gun. 
I'm gonna kill you! 
I don't have a gun, cowboy. 
I'm unarmed. 
Stay where you are! 
You're drunk. 
You don't know what you're doing. 
Now give me that gun before you get into real trouble. 
I don't stand for nobody talking like that to no lady. 
You stand real still and just give me that gun. 
I ain't no gunman. 
I couldn't kill anybody. 
I know that, cowboy. 
You were just trying to impress the lady. 
Charlie, take him down and sober him up and get him out of town. 
- You're under arrest. 
- For what, Mr Earp? 
- You just saw it, disturbing the peace. 
- Wait a minute, Wyatt. 
It's all right, Mayor Kelly. 
The marshal's only trying to save the good name of Dodge City. 
Besides, I might like to see the inside of a jail. 
Don't you think you better wait for a few of your deputies? 
I might be desperate. 
I'll let you go if you promise to do your gambling south of the deadline. 
South of the deadline? 
No, I think I'll stay. 
Perhaps the judge isn't as righteous as the marshal. 
Well, aren't you going to open the door? 
Oh, I won't be needing these while I'm here. 
Why don't you buy yourself a new halo? 
The one you're wearing's too tight. 
Close the door, Marshal. 
- Locked her up? 
- That's right. 
Disturbing the peace. 
- I could get her out. 
- $ 500 says you can't. 
Make it the $ 1,000 I owe you. 
Double or nothing. 
It's a bet. 
I'll be back in 30 minutes. 
- Good evening, Charlie. 
- Oh, hiya, Doc. 
Man, this 12 on and 12 off is sure ruining my homework. 
I spend half my life on that darned paperwork. 
Care for a nip? 
Doc, you know Wyatt don't allow drinking on duty. 
- What's the occasion? 
- I'd like to bail out Miss Denbow. 
Hit me. 
- I got 19. 
- 20. 
Can't do it, Doc. 
She's got to appear in court tomorrow. 
No bail's been set yet. 
Think I'll stand on these. 
21. 
Oh, I'll wait for Wyatt. 
I sure hope Bat gets back with our deputies before them cowboys hit town. 
- Blackjack! 
- I've got one, too. 
You know, Doc, if we was playing for real, 
I'd just be compelled to have a look at that deck. 
Oh, I'd be compelled to ask you to try. 
Use mine, huh? 
Good thing Wyatt don't let us go around drawing these things. 
Somebody might get hurt. 
Well, I gotta go have a look at the prisoners and horses. 
- Watch the office for me, will you, Doc? 
- Sure thing, Charlie. 
Never could get the hang of these things. 
What are you doing here? 
Wyatt, I'd like to bail out Miss Denbow. 
She happens to be a lady. 
No favours, Holliday. 
Let's say you release her in exchange for some information. 
You don't know a thing that would interest me. 
Suppose I were to tell you that Shanghai Pierce is bringing his herd here. 
Shanghai Pierce, huh? 
I take it you've had some run-ins with him. 
I had to bat him over the head once or twice when he got drunk and tried to shoot up Wichita. 
Not a bad guy, just forgot to grow up. 
Well, he's aiming to shoot up Dodge City and he's hired Ringo to make sure you don't spoil his fun. 
Oh, and what's more, he's put a price of $ 1,000 on your head, dead. 
What else is new? 
Well, I thought it was kind of amusing, a price on a lawman's head. 
Look, Holliday, as long as I'm the law here, not one of those cowpokes is going to cross that deadline with a gun. 
I don't care if his name is Shanghai Pierce. 
Well spoken. 
I'll repeat those words at your funeral. 
- How about releasing Miss Denbow? 
- Nothing doing. 
Look, you made a deal. 
You made the deal. 
I didn't agree to a thing, remember? 
- Charlie, you're working for a crook. 
- Oh, yeah? 
Go on home, Charlie, and turn in. 
I'll finish these reports. 
Thanks. 
Everything's quiet. 
- Night. 
- Night. 
Wyatt, you ought to turn her loose. 
She's got no business behind bars. 
I think Charlie's right. 
Let her out. 
- Conscience? 
- Maybe I like her. 
Tell Kelly she's to play in the side room. 
I don't want her gambling on the main floor. 
- Good evening, Miss Denbow. 
- Good evening, Doc. 
Come on, Laura, we've got business to take care of. 
Thank you. 
Marshal. 
- Good evening, Mr Earp. 
- Good evening, Miss Denbow. 
Good evening, Mr Earp. 
- Pair of deuces. 
- I'll check to the lady. 
- $ 50. 
- I'll stay. 
- Too steep for me. - I'm in. 
$ 50, and I'll make it $ 50 more. 
- I'm in for the $ 50. 
- Deal. 
- Doc, it's almost morning. 
- Queen of clubs, jack of spades, 
- three tens, three deuces. 
- You didn't answer me. 
- I'll make it $ 100. 
- Doc! 
Go buy yourself a drink. 
- And I'll raise you $ 100. 
- Too much for me. 
$ 200 to me, I'll call you. 
- I'll go along with the lady. 
- Four deuces. 
Gentlemen, we've been outclassed. 
Thank you, gentlemen. 
I think I'll call it a night. 
Will you cash me in, Frank? 
Good night. 
Good night, Mayor Kelly. 
- Good night, Miss Denbow. 
- May I see you home? 
No, thank you, Doc. Good night. 
Good night. 
- Well, how about a little draw, boys? 
- All right. 
I get a little ante in there and we'll... 
Good night. 
She's a real lady and lucky. 
That's true. 
And what have we here? 
Let's see. 
Kelly, I need Luke Short. 
Ritchie Bell and two of his boys held up the bank in Salina. 
They killed the cashier. They're heading this way. 
I sent Luke to Abilene, Wyatt. 
I'm sorry. 
How soon do you have to pull out? 
Right away if I expect to pick up their trail. 
Doggone it, Luke's the only one in town who can handle a gun. 
- What about Charlie Bassett? 
- Somebody's gotta mind the town. 
Want a gunhand? 
You? 
No, thanks. 
I do handle one pretty well. 
The only trouble is those best able to testify to my aim aren't around for comment. 
- I'll take care of it alone. 
- Suit yourself. 
Hold up your right hand. 
Do you solemnly swear to uphold... 
Oh, this is ridiculous. 
You're deputized. Grab some gear. 
I'll get the horses. 
Wait a minute. 
Don't I get to wear a tin star? 
Not on your life! 
Medicine. 
For a smart gambler, you sure play sucker odds. 
You're gonna be dead inside of a year. 
What do you know about odds, Preacher? 
This kind of cough doesn't go away. 
Why don't you get out of those stinking saloons? 
- Pack up and go live in the mountains. 
- Not me. 
You're just ornery enough to live to a ripe old age. 
No, I'm not gonna let it drain me out slow. 
Sure, play it hard and fast. 
Listen, Wyatt, the only thing I'm really scared of is dying in bed. 
I don't want to go little by little. 
Someday, somebody's got to out-shoot me, and it'll be over with real quick. 
Earp, I didn't come along to hear you preach a sermon. 
You know, I've been wondering about that. 
Why did you come? 
If I stick around long enough, sooner or later you've got to put your head in a noose. 
I'm gonna bail you out. 
I've only got one debt in this world, and I don't like owing it to you. 
You don't owe me a thing. 
I've never needed anybody in my life and I sure don't need Doc Holliday. 
You're pretty positive about that. 
As far as I'm concerned, you can get on your horse and keep riding. 
No, thanks. 
I think I'll stay. 
You know, Wyatt, you and I are pretty much alike, actually. 
Both of us live with a gun. 
The only difference is that badge. 
What's the matter, Preacher, don't you like being preached at? 
Shut up and go to sleep. 
Ritchie Bell won't be robbing any more banks. 
- I thought you were asleep. 
- No, I figured. 
Let's head back to Dodge. 
I want to get in a bed. 
What for? 
They're not going anyplace. 
Neither are we. 
I'm getting some sleep. 
Get out of those stinking saloons, pack up, live in the mountains. 
- Charlie. 
- Hi. 
I'll go in and fix up the coroner's report. 
Thanks a lot, Doc. 
You and I are even. 
Not yet. 
Not until the debt's paid in full, Marshal. 
I hear you did some pretty fancy shooting, Doc. 
Well, all in a day's work for a deputy. 
You all right? 
Find Kate and tell her to come up to the hotel right away, will you? 
Kate hasn't been around for a while, Doc. 
What do you mean? 
Well, I mean, nobody's seen her on this side of town since you rode out. 
Should I get a doctor? 
Morning, Laura. 
Oh, I never thought I'd be glad to see you. 
- Something wrong? 
- My horse has gone lame. 
Right forefoot. 
- Hoof's split. 
Better not ride him in. 
- Oh. 
Leave him here. 
He won't go far. 
- I'll send the blacksmith out. 
- Nice you happened along. 
I didn't happen along. 
I know you ride out this way every day. 
Come on, I'll give you a ride into town. 
Unless you'd rather walk six miles. 
Better hold on tight. 
Tighter. 
Doc, what are you doing up this time of day? 
It's only 3 : 00. 
I'm on a health bender, up before noon, take a 20-yard walk. 
What's the action here? 
Picking up the hardware as soon as the cowboys hit town. 
Sure don't look like Bat's gonna get back with our deputies soon enough. 
Where's Kate? 
Where is she, Charlie? 
It's kind of touchy, Doc, I... 
I... 
Yes? 
You promised Wyatt there wouldn't be any gunplay, Doc. 
Now you can't... 
Where is she, Charlie? 
Wiley's Hotel. 
Ringo blew into town and Kate's taken up with him. 
Sure is a lot of beef coming in here. 
This is just the beginning. 
Wait till the... 
Look, Doc, a gunfight right now could cause Wyatt a lot of trouble, a lot of trouble! 
Sure is a mess of cattle here. 
Get out and stay out, you no-good tramp and don't come back! 
So you got homesick. 
- Well, well, if it ain't the little deputy. 
- You've been gone for three days. 
I didn't think you'd notice. 
You've been gallivanting all over the country with Mr Virtue. 
I was sick, Kate. 
I needed you. 
Why don't you put a rope around my neck and pull on it when you want me? 
Can't stay away. 
Just can't stay away, can you? 
Oh, leave me alone, Doc. 
Always got to crawl back to your gutter. 
Maybe I wouldn't if you ever noticed I was alive! 
What difference does it make to you where I go or who I take up with? 
Shut up! 
Get your things together, you're leaving. 
She's staying here. 
Keep out of this, Ringo. 
You got no right to come busting in here. 
I'm talking to Kate! 
Take a walk. 
Anything you got to say, you can say in front of him. 
You slut. 
Wait a minute, Holliday. 
You don't talk to my woman like that. 
- Your woman. Anybody's woman. 
- I'm gonna blast you apart. 
I don't have a gun, Ringo. 
You got one now. 
Reach. 
- I'm not fighting. 
- He won't fight. 
He promised Wyatt Earp he'd be a good little boy. 
I heard you made your reputation against a bunch of drunks. 
Go on, reach. 
I'm not fighting. 
Well, have a drink then. 
Oh, Doc. 
It was a lovely dance. 
I'm sorry I have to leave so soon. 
You're breaking a lot of hearts. 
- Good night, Mayor Kelly. 
- Good night, Miss Denbow. 
- May I take you somewhere? 
- No, thank you. 
It's just a short way. 
It's early and I have to ride out for the bluffs. 
Oh, it is lovely here. 
I'm glad I came. 
You've lost your poker face. 
You look like a scared little girl. 
I'm not scared, and I'm certainly not a little girl. 
Why did you come out here with me? 
I wish I could answer that. 
I don't know. 
I'll tell you why you came. 
- Frisky bunch, eh, Ringo? 
- Yeah. 
This ought to learn them once and for all who owns the cowtowns! 
Yeah. 
Shanghai Pierce has hit town. 
His men are hoo-hahing Front Street. 
Now see if you can find Wyatt quick as you can and get some help. 
I'll try to hold them off. 
I don't want anybody out there on the streets. 
Pierce, call off your men before somebody gets hurt. 
Tell your boss I'm waiting for his personal invitation. 
You're under arrest, Pierce. 
- You hear that, Ringo? 
I'm under arrest. 
- I heard. 
Sure are noisy. 
Sure are. 
- Let's quit. 
I want to get out of here. 
- Just keep dealing. 
I'm not breaking this run. 
Hit me. 
- Doc, please! 
- Deal. 
Well, what have we here? 
A dance! 
Now ain't that nice? 
You folks gonna invite us in? 
Ain't very hospitable, are they, boss? 
You'd better get that scum of yours south of the deadline. 
Do you hear that, boys? 
These are respectable folks. 
They're good enough to take our money. 
I say my men are good enough to dance with your women! 
My boys want to dance! 
Piano player, make some music! 
- Hello, Shanghai. 
- Well, now my day is complete. 
You and me are gonna settle for this scar you gave me in Wichita. 
Unbuckle your guns, boys, and come on down to the calaboose with me. 
You better start praying, Earp. 
You pulled your last bluff. 
Start thinking straight, Shanghai, before you get into too much trouble and you can't get out of it. 
Let's work him over, boss. 
Yeah, that's a real good idea. 
Maybe your friends would like to see how tough you really are. 
I'd like to see you do a dance, Marshal. 
That's mighty brave talk, Shanghai, with 20 men behind you. 
Let's you and me step out into the street alone. 
Oh, no. 
You don't sucker me into that. 
Can't bluff your way out, huh? 
All right, boys, take the skunk. 
You gentlemen made such a racket, Frank Loving was too scared to deal. 
You busted my winning streak. 
Fun's over, boys. 
Unbuckle them. 
- Let's shoot it out. 
- All right, Shanghai? 
Go ahead, draw, all of you! 
- But you get it first, Shanghai. 
- And you second, Ringo. 
Well, call the play. 
I'll give you five seconds to unbuckle your guns. 
One. 
Two. 
Three. 
Four. 
We had enough fun, boys. 
Unbuckle them. 
Harry, Jackson, get the hardware. 
Get moving! 
Doc! 
Anybody else want to try their luck? 
Get moving. 
Come on, keep moving, all of you! 
All right, Doc. 
We ain't finished yet. 
You would have been, but I feel in a charitable mood tonight. 
Keep moving. 
Come on. 
Kelly, take them down and lock them up for the night. 
You heard the marshal. 
Come on, let's get moving. 
I don't suppose you want my thanks. 
Let's just say my account is paid in full. 
And don't take it personal, Marshal. 
- Morning, Doc. 
- Morning. 
Just thought you'd like to know there's going to be one less lawman in the territory. 
That's always good news to me. 
I'm heading for California, buying a ranch. 
Taking your good advice, getting out while there's time. 
Smart man. 
Laura's coming with me. 
We're getting married in a few days. 
We'd like you to come to the wedding, Doc, if it doesn't interfere with your poker. 
I'm not good at weddings, only funerals. 
Deal me out. 
Wyatt, this is a real lady. 
I wish you both a lot of happiness. 
You're lucky to be getting out of this country. 
Why don't you try your luck? 
So long, Doc. 
Take me back, Doc. 
Please? 
Give me another chance. 
Please take me back. 
I'll do anything you say. 
I don't care how you treat me. 
Doc, I'm sorry for what I done. 
It's not your fault, Kate. 
It's not my fault. 
It's not anybody's fault. 
It's just the way the cards fall. 
I never gave you much of a chance, did I? 
Yeah, maybe it could have been different if I was right to you, but... 
It ain't too late, Doc. 
I'll be good to you, I promise. 
It's too late for both of us. 
Do something better for yourself while you've still got the chance. 
Don't let me go, Doc. 
- Don't let me go back there. 
- Leave me alone. 
Just leave me alone. 
I'll see you dead. 
- Hiya, Wyatt. 
- Charlie. 
You got a letter from the Attorney General. 
What's he got to say? 
He says he can get you an appointment as US Marshal any time you want it. 
Wyatt Earp, United States Marshal. 
That's all I need. 
These are all dead, Charlie. 
Oh, before I forget. 
This is yours now. 
I'm through as a lawman for good. 
- Oh, you got a telegram, too. 
- Read it. 
Virgil's my brother. 
He's in trouble. 
He needs me. 
Try to understand, Laura. 
I understand I was foolish to fall in love. 
- Oh, if only I could... 
- Wyatt, when I first met you, 
I told you I wouldn't follow you from town to town, sitting in the darkness, waiting for someone to bring the news you've been killed. 
I won't live that way. 
We're not going to start a life together with a gun in your hand. 
I swear to you, Laura, I'm through after Tombstone. 
You'll never be through. 
Your reputation will follow you wherever you are. 
- Laura, he's my brother! 
- And I'm to be your wife. 
Don't ask me to let him down. 
Don't let me down then. 
I'll give up anything. 
I'll go anywhere for you. 
I'll work beside you in the fields. 
But you've got to meet me halfway. 
I must go to Tombstone. 
All right, go. 
Clean up Tombstone. 
There's 100 more Tombstones on the frontier, all waiting for the great Wyatt Earp. 
Go on, clean them all up! 
Go on! 
I love you, Laura. 
I love you, Wyatt. 
Ride on 
Ride on 
To hell And gone 
Wyatt's heart was sad 
He'd give all he had to stay 
Stay on 
Wyatt's lady fair, he left her crying there 
He broke his vow and rode away to Tombstone 
Afternoon, Marshal. 
Out for a little ride? 
About 700 miles worth. 
Tombstone. 
Tombstone, huh? 
I was heading that way myself. 
Understand the climate down there may be better for my cough. 
Since when have you gotten interested in your health? 
Well, it's really a matter of finances. 
The deck's gone cold here. 
Nobody will give me any play. 
Mind if I ride along? 
It's a free country, hop on. 
Where's your gear? 
- Boot Hill 
- On a hill, on a hill 
- Boot Hill 
- There's a chill, there's a chill 
- So cold 
- Mighty cold, mighty cold 
- So still 
- Mighty still, mighty still 
Will the Doc and his friend 
Will both of them end 
In the graveyard That's known as Boot Hill? 
Thanks for the ride. 
Sell my horse and get a good price. 
Doc... 
I know, no knives, no guns, no killings. 
Man, that's good. 
I'd just about forgot what a home-cooked meal tastes like. 
Betty, I'm going to steal you away from Virgil. 
By golly, Wyatt, you're going to be the only single one left. 
I got a family going in Deadwood. 
Even little Jimmy here is tying the knot when he gets back to California. 
What do you mean" little Jimmy"? 
I'll be 19 next month. 
Nineteen! 
Say, when are you gonna get hitched, Wyatt? 
Cigar? 
There's the signal for women and children to leave the room. 
Come on, Tommy. 
It's your bedtime now. 
- Aw, Mom, do I have to? 
- Yes, you do. 
Your uncles will all be here tomorrow. 
- Good night, Uncle Wyatt. 
- Good night, Tommy. 
- Good night, Uncle Morgan. 
- Good night, son. 
- Good night, Uncle James. 
- Good night, Tommy. 
- Good night, Daddy. 
- Good night, Son. 
It's nice to have you here. 
I only wish it were under happier circumstances. 
Seems pretty upset. 
Well, she's been asking me for a year to quit marshalling. 
You know how women are. 
All right. 
Now let's get down to business. 
Now, Morgan and Jimmy know the setup here. 
Now, Wyatt, you know Ike Clanton. 
He has a ranch outside city limits. 
Yes, I know. 
Well, he's organised the toughest bunch of gunslingers you ever laid eyes on. 
And he owns the County Sheriff. 
- Who is he? 
- Cotton Wilson. 
Cotton Wilson. 
So lke paid off on his deal, eh? 
Clanton's been rustling Mexican cattle by the thousands, and he has to move them. 
But he can only ship them out of Tombstone, and he can't do that while we control the city. 
That's about it. 
He's organised and he's mean. 
We can't keep him out of Tombstone forever. 
What about the people of Tombstone? 
John Clum, editor of the Epitaph, and some of the leading citizens will back us if they know you're calling the shots. 
We're all agreed, Wyatt, you should run the show. 
There's only one thing that bothers me, and I'm going to speak my piece now. 
There's gonna be a lot of bad talk about you riding with Doc Holliday. 
What about Holliday? 
He's the worst killer on the frontier, that's what about him. 
And it just don't look good, you coming here with him. 
Holliday saved my life in Dodge City. 
I don't forget that. 
What's more, he's a man of his word. 
As long as he plays his cards straight and keeps out of killings, we got no right to run him out of town. 
I didn't know you two were a team. 
We're not. 
It's just a case of square deal. 
Holliday stays. 
All right, Wyatt. 
He's your responsibility. 
That suits me fine. 
Now, do we have a map of the county here? 
Now the first thing we got to do is let the Clantons know that the city is closed to them. 
Then we got to control the county. 
Now, that's important. 
I'm gonna get a letter off to a man tonight who'll take care of that little matter for us. 
Now show me where the Clanton ranch is. - Here. 
- And where does he keep his... 
Hello, Cotton. 
I've been expecting you. 
You're looking fine, real prosperous. 
- Oh, I ain't complaining. 
- What's on your mind? 
Wyatt, Ike wants to make you a deal. 
He promises no trouble if you let him ship his cattle out of Tombstone. 
Well, that's mighty nice of Ike. 
Ike's a nice fellow. 
He's got a fortune tied up in cattle out there at the ranch. 
- And he's gonna move them. 
- Oh, he is, huh? 
There's $ 20,000 in it for you. 
Cash. 
$ 20,000? 
The wages of sin are rising. 
$ 20,000 against a six-foot hole in Boot Hill or a $ 20-a-month pension, if you live long enough to collect it. 
I've thought about those things. 
You know, Cotton, this is a nice little town. 
Good place to set a while. 
I might even run for County Sheriff in a couple of months. 
That don't scare me at all. 
I got a ranch now and $ 25,000 in the bank. 
And you know something? 
It don't bother my sleep not one bit. 
It would mine, though. 
Why don't you get off that pulpit, Wyatt? 
Ellsworth, Wichita, Dodge City, and what have they got you, but a life full of misery and a woman who walked out on you and the friendship of a killer? 
Take this message back to your boss. 
So that's the way he wants it, huh? 
He aims to pull the town out from under you, Ike. 
- Been a long time, Ike. 
- Too long. 
Hello, Ringo. 
Still renting your gun to the highest bidder? 
That's right, Marshal. 
Ain't you a little young to be packing a gun, son? 
Why don't you try me? 
Going someplace? 
We're taking in the show, Marshal. 
Any objections? 
No, soon as you check in your sidearms. 
Why don't you check it in for me, Marshal? 
Now! 
You boys know my brothers. 
Meet John Clum, head of the Citizens' Committee. 
You're a marked man, Wyatt. 
There's no place in this town for you, Ike. 
The next time you ride in armed, you ride out feet first. 
Now get moving. 
- Here comes trouble. 
- Who is she? 
That's Kate Fisher. 
She just couldn't stay away. 
- Four blues. 
- Call, you suckers. 
Barkeep, some whiskey down here. 
Leave the bottle. 
Two pair, aces up. 
- Hey, Doc, what've you got? 
- Three treys. 
Nice town, huh, Kate? 
Well, well, well, if it ain't the little deputy. 
Doc, your deal. 
Gonna say hello to an old friend? 
Draw. 
Give me some créme de menthe. 
Hey, little deputy. 
Would you like to have another drink with me? 
You're drunk, Ringo. 
That's the way you made your reputation, wasn't it, against drunks? 
Get your gun. 
I'll meet you in the street in five minutes. 
I'll be there. 
I said I'd see you dead. 
What kind of a sucker play is this? 
It's all Clanton needs to start a war. 
Look, I've had it up to here. 
You want to play patty-cake with them, go ahead. 
Give me your gun, Doc. 
You got no right packing it. 
Now you can... 
You can thank God you're Wyatt Earp's brother. 
Holliday, if you think anything about Wyatt, you'll get out of here. 
Having a killer like you around is the worst thing that can happen to him! 
- I hear you're leaving Tombstone. 
- You hear good. 
I'm taking a stage tomorrow. 
Kind of thought this climate was good for your cough. 
Listen, Preacher, being here is causing me a lot of embarrassment. 
Some people are even taking me as a lawman. 
You're not leaving on my account? 
Your account? 
You've got nothing to do with my leaving. 
Good luck, Doc. 
Too bad we won't be in on the finish together. 
- Hiya, Wyatt. - John. 
Here's that letter you've been waiting for. 
What do we got here? 
Young Clanton passed out drunk at the Alhambra. 
Throw him in the tank and let him sleep it off. 
Hold it a minute. 
John, how long is it going to take you to get those men you promised me? 
Any time you say. 
I think I'll take a little trip out to the Clanton ranch. 
- You crazy? 
- I don't think so. 
Well, take your gun. 
This is all the ammunition I'll need. 
If I'm not back in a couple of hours, Virge, have Clum's Citizens' Committee drag my carcass out. 
Billy! 
He's all right, ma'am. 
Just got himself a little liquored up. 
All right, on your feet. 
Billy, you get in the house! 
I don't know what I'm going to do with that boy. 
The way he's going now, he's going to end up like his father, shot down for stealing cattle. 
You think you're pretty tough, don't you, son? 
I never saw a gunslinger yet so tough he lived to celebrate his 35th birthday. 
I learnt one rule about gunslingers. 
There's always a man faster on the draw than you are, and the more you use a gun, the sooner you're gonna run into that man. 
You think I don't know what's inside of you. 
I had a couple of big brothers. 
They fought in the Civil War, and I was too young to go. 
I tried to live up to them the same way that you're trying to live up to Ike and Finn. 
- You know about that, huh? 
- You can bet I know about that. 
It's not that I want to be a gunfighter, exactly. 
It's just... 
I don't know, sometimes I get lonely. 
All gunfighters are lonely. 
They live in fear. 
They die without a dime or a woman or a friend. 
You know, I never thought about it like that. 
Well, think about it. Think about it. 
Billy, listen to the marshal. 
- I won't do it no more, Ma. 
- Oh, please don't. 
What are you doing here? 
Just brought your kid brother home, drunk. 
You should be proud, real proud. 
You'd better get riding. 
I wouldn't do that, Ike. 
Some of my friends in Tombstone might begin to worry if I'm not back soon. 
That don't cut no ice with me, Wyatt. 
You're out of your territory this time. 
Am I? 
My appointment, United States Marshal. 
Sorry to disappoint you. 
Now wait a minute, Wyatt. 
I'm not looking for a fight, but you've got to stop pushing me. 
Now why don't we sit down and talk it over? 
I'll make you any kind of deal you ask. 
The only deal I want is for you to run that stolen herd back to Mexico. 
- Did you see the judge? 
- I seen him. 
Well? 
There's no legal way you can keep a United States Marshal out of the county. 
Judge was packing up to leave when I got there. 
I think it's about time we all pack up and leave, Ike. 
Shut up, Frank! 
There's only one thing we can do. 
We didn't have no trouble till that Wyatt Earp got here. 
You're making sense now, Ike. 
All right. 
We got no choice. 
We'll ambush him tonight. 
Ain't you forgetting about the rest of the Earps? 
Now, look, we can handle the Earps if we make this a personal fight. 
- What if they bring in Clum? 
- They won't, they're too proud. 
They're gonna come to us the way we want. 
It's a law bigger than any law in the books. 
Family pride. 
We'll get that Wyatt when he makes his late round. 
Don't make no difference to me. 
Tired? 
Yeah, I guess I must have dozed a little. 
- Betty sent some coffee. 
- Well, that's gonna hit the spot. 
It's awful quiet. 
Too quiet. 
Wyatt, do you figure we're gonna have to fight it out with the Clantons? 
I wish I knew, Jimmy. 
Maybe lke will see how hopeless it all is. 
- You itching to get back to California? 
- I think about it all the time. 
- She must be quite a girl. 
- Yeah, she is. 
Well, I better get to work. 
Look, how about letting me make the rounds for you tonight? 
I get awful lonesome sitting here with nothing to do but think. 
Sure, you go ahead. 
I could use some sleep. 
Least when I'm making the rounds, it gives me something else to think about. 
Ike's called the play. 
We'll do it his way now. 
Don't do that, Wyatt. 
That's what they want. 
Don't let them push you into a personal fight. 
That's mighty funny coming from you. 
You're a lawman, Wyatt. 
Don't throw away a lifetime's work. 
Where's your logic? 
To hell with logic! 
That's my brother lying there. 
- Who is it? 
- Open the door! 
Start talking, Kate. Doc, 
- I don't know nothing about it. 
- Talk! 
Why? 
What difference does it make now? 
I sure messed everything up real good, ain't I? 
I wanted you back, because I love you. 
And... 
I thought if Wyatt was out of the way, you'd come back to me. 
And that's why I kept quiet when I heard them. 
I must've been out of my mind! 
Where? 
The Clanton ranch. 
Who was there? 
I didn't want that boy to be killed! 
Who was there? 
Ike, Finn, Cotton Wilson and the MacLowerys. 
And Ringo? 
Was Ringo there? 
Yes, Ringo was there. 
Don't, Doc. 
Don't, Doc. 
Oh, please don't, Doc! 
Doc! 
Doc! 
Please don't, Doc. 
Please don't kill me! 
Please! 
Please! 
Please! 
No, don't kill me! 
Doc? 
Doc. 
Doc! 
Oh, Doc. 
It's all right, honey. 
It's all right, honey. 
Wyatt, Ike sent me. 
I didn't have nothing to do with it. 
I didn't know nothing about James! 
You gotta believe me, you got to. 
I guess it's just because your name is Clanton. 
Ike sent me to see you. 
He wants to meet with you and your family, personal. 
- I've been expecting it. 
- With no interference from Clum. 
You have my word. 
How many men is he bringing? 
Six. 
There'll be lke and Finn and Ringo and the MacLowerys. 
Where and when? 
Sunup at OK Corral. 
You tell lke we'll be there. 
You said six. 
I'll be coming with them. 
Don't do it, Billy. 
Give yourself a chance to live. 
No, I thought about it. 
I thought real hard about it. 
No, sir, I can't run. 
Ike and Finn are my brothers. 
You understand that, don't you? 
Yes, Billy, I understand that. 
How can you sit there like you're playing checkers? 
How can you sit there like that? 
What's the matter with you? 
Why don't you go get John Clum and ask for some help? 
I told you, this is not Clum's affair. 
This is personal, between us and Ike Clanton. 
But you're lawmen. 
You are lawmen, all three of you. 
You have no right to put yourselves above the safety of this town! 
Your duty is to the people, not to your own pride. 
Proud, proud men. 
Look at you. 
Look at the proud men! 
Morgan, does your wife know she'll be a widow tomorrow? 
I think you'd better leave the room. 
Virgil, your son wants to kiss you good night. 
See you in the morning. 
Doc, wake up. 
Doc, it's me, Wyatt. 
Wake up! 
Do you hear me? 
You drunken sot! 
I need you, Doc. 
Don't let me down. 
Wake up, do you hear me? 
Wake up. 
Leave him alone. 
Can't you see he's dying? 
Leave them alone. 
Doc, how do you feel? 
The fight's this morning, isn't it? 
What? 
I don't know. 
Doc, you can't. 
You can't! 
Doc, you can't! 
Look, you can't even stand up! 
You're gonna die for sure if you go out there. 
If I'm gonna die, at least let me die with the only friend I ever had. 
We don't make no difference, huh? 
You and I? 
We don't matter, Kate. 
We haven't mattered since the day we were born. 
- Get the horses around back. 
- All right. 
Get going, Cotton. 
Frank, take the rifle, get inside the wagon. 
Up front. 
Morgan and Virgil are waiting. 
Ike wants to talk to you alone. 
He's unarmed. 
Wait a minute, Wyatt. 
Kate told me about the killing of your brother. 
It was the Clantons all right and you were in on it! 
I had nothing to do with it. 
Get back where you belong. 
- Believe me, Wyatt, if... 
- Get back with your friends. 
They're coming. 
- They got Doc Holliday with them. 
- Holliday, huh? 
Cotton, you get over with the horses. 
Ike, I can't take this kind of gunplay anymore. 
Let me out. 
Get over there. 
Seven of them with Cotton. 
I only see six. 
Spread. 
Frank. 
Hit the dirt! 
Cover me. 
Shotgun! 
- You all right? 
- All right, all right. 
Cotton, you chicken-livered, miserable... 
He killed my brother! 
- Tom, stay back, you fool! - He killed my brother! 
Come on, Earp! 
I'll kill you! 
Come on, Earp! 
Earp, come out and get it! 
Virge, hurt bad? 
Yeah, my legs. 
Doc. 
I'll take care of Ringo. 
Billy, throw down your gun and come on out. 
Give up, boy! 
You haven't got a chance! 
Come in and get me. 
Come in and get me! 
Don't make me do it, boy. 
Don't make me do it. 
I'm shoving off, Doc. 
How are the brothers? 
Coming along fine. 
They're gonna be all right. 
Another glass, Joe. 
I just want you to know I'd have never made it without you. 
- Where you heading? 
- California. 
Laura? 
I don't know. 
I hope so. 
She'll be waiting. 
Will you listen to me for just once? 
Will you get up to that hospital in Denver? 
At this rate, you can't last more than a couple of months. 
You crazy? 
And give up this winning streak? 
I'll see you around. 
So long, Preacher. 
- Good afternoon, gentlemen. 
- Hello, Doc. 
- Hi, Doc. 
- What's the name of this game? 
- Boot Hill 
- On a hill, on a hill 
- Boot Hill 
- There's a chill, there's a chill 
- So cold 
- Mighty cold, mighty cold 
- So still 
- Mighty still, mighty still 
Here they lie, side by side 
The killers that died 
In the gunfight at OK Corral 
OK Corral 
OK Corral 
Gunfight at 
OK Corral 
Is it finished? 
The engine still knocks when it's cold, but that's normal. 
Foucher! 
Can you stay an extra hour? 
Tonight, it's a problem. 
But I think Pierre is free. 
Pierre, can you stay tonight? 
Check the ignition on the gentleman's Mercedes. 
Are you coming to the game? 
No, I can't. 
Are you going? 
Sure. 
Aubin asked me to stay overtime... 
No way! Tonight is special! 
I'm going to the theater. 
What are they playing? 
Carmen! 
I don't like operas. 
Movies are better. 
I'm going dancing tonight. 
Give me a smoke. 
All that singing gives me a pain. 
I like movies better. 
You said that already. 
See you tomorrow. 
My love... oh, my love. 
Geneviève, my little Geneviève. 
Guy, I love you. 
You smell like gasoline. 
It's just another perfume. 
Guy, I love you. 
Oh, Guy, I love you. 
A customer. I have to run. 
See you at 8 : 00 in front of the theater. 
I've thought of you all day! 
Would you like to go dancing later? 
If you wish. 
Can I help you? 
An umbrella. 
Where were you? 
Just across the street. 
Have you decided which kind you would like? 
An umbrella. A black umbrella. 
Geneviève, show the gentleman the umbrellas. 
Is that you, Guy? 
Good evening, Aunt Elise. 
Good evening, my boy. 
How are your legs? 
Fine, my boy. 
What are you up to? 
I'm hungry. 
You'll spoil your appetite. 
I do what I please. 
Calm down and talk to me. 
I haven't much time. 
You seem very nervous. 
I'm going out. 
Alone? 
None of your business. 
I think it is. 
With a girl. 
Do you love her? 
It could be. 
Tell me the truth. 
Yes, I love her. 
What's the matter? 
You're crying! 
No, I'm not. 
I can see that you are. 
Is it because you're lonely? 
I'm not lonely. 
I have my books. 
Madeleine will give me my shot. 
She will keep me company. 
What, then? 
Maybe happiness makes me sad. 
That's silly. 
You big brute, you're messing up my hair. 
Good evening, Guy. 
Good evening, Madeleine. 
You are sad. 
You seem happy. 
Does it show? 
I had a terrible time... 
Why? 
Persuading Mother. 
It was getting late, and the seamstress was late. 
Look. 
Careful, it's still full of pins. 
You know, 
I think she suspects something. 
Who? 
Mother. 
When I said I was going to the theater with Cécile, she gave me a funny look. 
What kind of a look? 
Like that. 
She knows quite well that Cécile hates shows, and since I'm a very bad liar... 
That's what you say! 
I assure you, I'm very awkward. 
I stammered and blushed and immediately changed the subject. 
Something squeezed. 
Something? 
Lemon. 
The same. 
Do you love me? 
A mambo. Let's go! 
I should have changed shoes. 
We'll have children. 
I'll call my daughter Françoise. 
And if it's a boy? 
It will be a girl. 
We've always had girls in the family. 
One o'clock. 
If Mother's not asleep, what a scene there will be. 
I should wear makeup, don't you think? 
You're lovely as you are. 
A little bit here. 
Where? 
There. 
We'll sell umbrellas. 
No, not umbrellas. 
We'll sell the shop. 
We'll buy a gas station. 
Why? What an idea! 
All white, with an office. You'll see. 
You'll smell like gasoline all day. 
What happiness... 
We'll be very happy... 
And we'll stay in love... 
You haven't told your mother? 
Not yet. 
Why? 
You're a coward. 
You mustn't be angry. 
I know what she'll say. 
What? 
" My little girl, you're crazy. 
Thinking of marriage at your age!" 
My little girl, you're crazy. 
Thinking of marriage at 16! 
Seventeen. 
In love! 
Am I too ugly or too stupid? 
No, you're not ugly. 
You're not the fairest of them all, but you're neither ugly nor dumb. 
The thing is, you have plenty of time. 
You think you're in love. 
But love is something different. 
You don't just fall in love with a face that you've seen in the street. 
He's a young man I've met several times, and he loves me. 
We want to get married. 
You don't answer? 
I'm flabbergasted. 
I went with him to the theater last night. 
Great! 
First you lie to me, then you admit it without the slightest shame. 
There's no shame in wanting to get married. 
At your age, there is. Well, no... 
You're just a little girl. 
You know nothing. 
Well, what you've taught me sure won't take me very far. 
When I married your father, I knew nothing. 
That's nothing to brag about. 
The paint shop, please? 
Next door. 
How old is he? 
Twenty. 
Of course, he hasn't done his military service yet. 
He lives with his godmother, the lady who raised him. 
I'm all he has, and you'll see, he's very handsome. 
I'll see nothing of the kind. 
But Mother... 
Go upstairs to the apartment. 
It's time to fix lunch. 
Geneviève! 
We're ruined! 
You always exaggerate. 
I owe 80,000 francs by the 15th. Is that funny? 
And if you don't pay? 
They'll seize our property. 
I'll get a job. 
What sort of a job? 
Anything. 
Post office or city hall? 
Why not? 
You understand, if I get married, 
Guy and I will work, and we'll help you. 
But, my little girl, it's out of the question for you to marry. 
Take that away. 
You're in my way. 
Anyway, what can he do? 
Can he support you? 
Raise children? 
He's not rich. 
We'll live modestly, and we won't have children right away. 
No, but one at least. 
He's not the one who will pay my taxes. 
There isn't a penny left in the till. 
Sell your jewels. My jewels? 
Never! 
What good are they? 
You don't even look at them. 
What if there's an emergency? 
Isn't what's happening an emergency? 
If I sold my jewels, I'd feel... stripped and naked. Impossible! 
Find something else. 
Something else? 
We have nothing. 
Then sell the shop. Stupid! 
What will we live on? 
Then again, a jewel is just a jewel. 
Should I change my hairstyle? 
My engagement ring... 
It's atrocious. 
This bracelet... 
I could never wear it. 
Nobody will want that. 
What about your necklace? My necklace? 
You think? 
That'd be a crime. No, I'll never part with it. 
Anyway, it's probably fake. Come on! 
Then again, it's not that pretty. 
This afternoon we'll go see Mr. Dubourg. 
Then I'll have my hair done. 
How beautiful! 
Truly marvelous. Isn't it? 
This is an impressive stone... if I may say so. 
Here are rubies, sapphires, emeralds. 
Ali Baba's cave. 
The jewels... of Sleeping Beauty. 
Of Sleeping Beauty. 
Hello, Mrs. Emery. 
Hello, Miss Geneviève. 
Hello, Mr. Dubourg. 
Will you excuse me? 
Please. 
The young lady has become very pretty. 
It's been such a long time since I've had the pleasure. 
But what can I do for you? 
You may speak frankly. 
We are in an embarrassing situation. 
Geneviève helps me as much as she can. 
It has nothing to do with her. 
But I have heavy expenses and I thought... 
Well, I have a payment to meet and if I don't, consequences will be dire. 
So I come to you as to my savior. 
I hesitated a long time, and Geneviève, who is the voice of wisdom and reason, persuaded me. 
It breaks my heart to be forced to give up this jewel, which to me represents... 
I understand, dear madame, but my business involves risks and I've already taken too many. 
At best, I can put your necklace up for sale, but for much less than its real worth. 
I cannot buy it myself. 
Couldn't you at least give me an advance? 
Nothing, I told you. We can do nothing. 
Don't insist, Mother. 
This is a disaster. 
Excuse me, but I'm interested. I'll buy your jewel. 
I can save you from your predicament. 
Allow me to introduce myself. 
Roland Cassard, diamond dealer. But, sir... 
Don't worry, madame, 
I'm no philanthropist. 
I'll easily sell this necklace in Paris or London, where I often go on business. 
I don't know if I should. 
Please, I'm serious. 
I'm ashamed, and at the same time, delighted. 
I don't have enough cash with me. 
I can give you a check. 
There's no hurry. 
Could you come tomorrow to my shop? 
" The Umbrellas of Cherbourg." 
I'm always there. 
See you tomorrow. 
What time is it? 
6 : 15. 
How come he isn't here yet? 
He might be a crook. 
He could have been leading you on. 
Don't imagine things. 
What's the matter with you? Nothing, Mother. 
Then be quiet. 
I'm going to see Guy. 
I forbid you to see that boy. 
Stay here. 
I wouldn't want to be disrespectful... 
Well, that's good! But I'm going. 
You'll stay here. 
Anyway, Mr. Cassard will be here soon, and I want you to be present. 
Because! 
If he's a crook, as you said, we'd better face him together. 
You think we'll be smart enough? 
I don't know, but stay here. I can't. 
Don't leave. 
I don't want you to leave. Geneviève! 
I had given up waiting for you. Are you crying? 
It's nothing. 
Sometimes I don't have the courage to deal with my troubles and my debts. 
Am I not here to help you? 
It's most kind of you. 
I just saw Miss Geneviève. I would have liked... 
She's gone out. 
The life we lead is so sad for a young girl. 
This dreary shop... 
I no longer amuse her, and I fear she'll become depressed. 
You see, she's bored. 
Would you like some tea? 
With pleasure. 
We've just had a terrible fight about you. About me? 
She wanted to go out. 
I didn't want her to. We quarreled. 
We're so lonely since my husband died. 
Maybe you should... I don't know... 
take her to a show. 
Maybe. 
Will you come to dinner tomorrow? 
Geneviève would be happy to see you. 
Impossible. 
I must leave tonight. 
I'm going back to Paris, and tomorrow I'm off to London. 
Here's the money I promised you. 
Give Geneviève my best regards, and I shall not fail 
to visit you on my next trip. 
I was so afraid I wouldn't find you. 
I'm so happy to be with you! 
Now I'm laughing because I realize how foolish I am when I'm alone. 
I talked to Mother about our marriage. 
Of course, she said I'm crazy. 
And tonight she forbade me to see you. 
You see, I was so afraid. 
I'd go anywhere, I'd never see Mother again, rather than lose you. 
We'll marry in secret. 
It doesn't matter anymore now. 
We have plenty of time. 
I just received my draft notice this morning. 
I'll be gone for two years. 
So we'll have to talk about marriage later. 
With the war in Algeria, it will be a long time before I can come back. 
But I'll never be able to live without you. 
I won't be able to. Don't go. 
I'll die. 
I'll hide you... and keep you... but, my love, don't leave me. 
You know it's not possible. 
I won't leave you. 
My love, I have to go. 
I want you to know that I'll think only of you. 
And I know that you'll wait for me. 
Two years... 
Two years of our life! 
Don't cry, I beg you. 
Two years... 
No, I can't face it. Calm down. 
We have so little time left. 
So little time, my love, and we mustn't waste it. 
We must try to be happy. 
Of our last moments we must keep a memory more beautiful than anything. 
A memory to help us live. 
I'm so afraid when I'm alone. 
We'll be together again, and we'll be stronger. 
You'll meet other women... you'll forget me. 
I will love you until the end of my life. 
Guy, I love you. 
Don't leave me. 
My love, don't leave me. 
Come, my love. 
Good evening, Aunt Elise. 
I don't feel too well. 
Is there anything you want? Nothing. 
I just need to rest. 
Good night, my little one. 
With Guy. 
He'll be away for two years. 
I can't live without him. 
Stop crying. 
Look at me. 
People only die of love in movies. 
It's too cruel... 
Separation is cruel, that's true. 
But time fixes a lot of things. You speak of love. 
What do you know of love? 
Are you sure of your feelings? 
Mother, can't you see how unhappy I am? 
I know, darling, I know. 
I have also loved, and fought... and suffered. 
You should listen to me. 
I do listen to you. 
Isn't it better to wait? 
Two years from now, perhaps you will have forgotten Guy. 
I'll never forget him. 
If you still love him when he returns, you'll see. You must believe me. 
You must calm down and get this affair out of your mind. 
Yes, Mother. 
You need distraction. Go out and live a little. 
It's not difficult. 
You're young, pretty and witty. 
You'll make friends your age... or older. 
Mr. Cassard came by this evening. 
He was sorry he missed you. 
I'm certain he could give you good advice. 
I can do without his advice. You're wrong! 
For me, he's the kind of man... 
Don't bore me with his kind! 
You look terrible. Leave me alone, Mother. 
Give me a kiss at least. 
Have faith. You'll see. 
Look at me, my boy. 
When you return, I don't know if I shall still be alive. 
But Elise! 
Don't say" but." I've had a good life, and I can leave it without regrets. 
Nonsense! 
Of course. 
She's better already. 
I'll meet death before you do. 
It's the army, not the war. 
Before you go, I want you to know that everything I have will be yours. 
Don't ever forget me. 
Write me from time to time. 
Madeleine will keep you informed. 
Farewell, my little one. 
My love, I'll wait for you all my life. 
I'll think only of you. 
Stay. 
Don't go, I beg you. 
Stay, my love. 
It's not time yet. 
I'm leaving now. 
Don't look at me. 
I can't. 
I can't. 
PART TWO 
- THE ABSENCE 
Well? 
Well what? You're so pale. 
What did the doctor say? 
Practically nothing. 
You didn't need to see a doctor for that. 
I could have told you myself. 
What else? He gave me a prescription. 
Sedatives, tonics and stuff. 
Stuff! 
Then it can't be very serious. 
You see, Geneviève, if the shop were doing better, 
I'd be the happiest of women. 
It's freezing. 
Do you know whom I met in town? 
You'll never guess. 
Roland Cassard! 
What do you say to that? 
What do you want me to say? 
He's incredibly nice. 
We talked for over an hour this morning. 
He's back from the US. 
What a man! He told me a thousand stories. 
I invited him to dinner. 
What's the matter, Geneviève? 
Nothing, I'm just tired. 
That's no reason for sulking like that. 
You may be tired, but you're not dying. 
It's not the fatigue that saddens me. It's his silence. 
Guy left two months ago. 
He's only written me once. 
Don't start that again! 
If I knew where he was, I could write him. 
I'm sure they've sent him to some dangerous place where he's risking his life. 
It's simpler than that. 
Simpler than what? 
He's forgotten you. 
You don't know what you're saying! 
He doesn't think about you. 
If he did, he would write. 
One can write, no matter how far away one is. 
It's nothing. 
I got so frightened. 
I suddenly saw Guy laughing with another woman. 
Sit down. 
I'll close the shop. 
You're hiding something. 
I'm not. 
It's serious, isn't it? 
I'm pregnant, Mother. 
This is horrible. Pregnant by Guy? 
How could this happen? 
Same as with everyone else. 
Don't joke about it. This is serious. 
What are we going to do? 
What do you mean? 
With the child? 
Bring it up. 
What will we say? 
To whom? 
I don't know... 
our neighbors, our friends! 
We have no friends. 
And you never speak to the neighbors. 
And Roland Cassard is coming to dinner tonight! 
We'll have to make him feel welcome and put up a good front. 
The way you look... 
pregnant... 
You don't need to tell him. 
Be quiet. 
It makes me shiver... just to think of it. 
Go upstairs and lie down. 
I feel just fine. 
Don't argue. 
I'll cook dinner myself. 
Don't worry. 
Maybe you need some rest. 
Yes, Geneviève has been overdoing it somewhat lately. 
She's a bit pale. 
Why don't you go live in the country? 
The situation in which we find ourselves is such that we cannot, for the time being, take any rest. 
Geneviève wouldn't go alone, and I can't leave the shop. 
There's no way out of it. 
So you can't be separated? 
We've practically never been parted. 
I haven't found the bean. 
I have it. 
You must pick a king and make a wish. 
I have no choice. 
You are my king. 
Thank you, Geneviève. 
Put this crown on. 
Put it on, Geneviève, like he asked you to. 
You look like the Virgin with Child I saw in Antwerp. 
My cheeks are burning. 
How amusing! 
I think I drank too much. 
I'll leave you now. 
I'm not feeling very well. 
Then I'll be going. 
Please. 
Let's chat a bit more. 
Good night, my darling. 
I'm really worried. 
Geneviève is sad, secretive, independent. 
And I admit I'm probably not tactful or understanding enough. 
I'm always afraid of hurting her. 
I wouldn't want to sound ridiculous, and my feelings could seem insincere, however... although I am taking this step, I wouldn't want to give the wrong impression. 
My only desire is to bring happiness. 
Am I making myself clear? 
Actually, not really. 
Ever since dinner began, 
I've been trying to broach a subject that preoccupies me, but my feelings are equaled only by my shyness. 
I came to ask you for Geneviève's hand. 
I'm very clumsy, I know. 
Not at all, but this is so unexpected. 
Geneviève for me is still a child, and your abrupt request is somewhat unsettling. 
You see, I don't know Geneviève's feelings for you. 
She's only spoken of you as a friend. 
I wouldn't want to pressure her in any way. 
We know nothing about you. 
Long ago, I loved a woman. 
She didn't love me. 
Her name was Lola. 
It was long ago. 
Disappointed, I tried to forget her. 
I left France. 
I traveled to the ends of the earth. 
But I had no more taste for life. 
Then, by chance, our paths crossed. 
As soon as I saw Geneviève, 
I knew she was the one I'd been waiting for. 
Since I met her, life has new meaning. 
She's always before my eyes. 
I live only for her. 
I think only of her. 
I had to speak to you frankly. 
Don't be offended. 
Of course, I wouldn't think of influencing Geneviève. 
Geneviève is free. 
Tomorrow I go back to Amsterdam for three months. 
When I return, Geneviève can give me her answer. 
I don't know what to say. 
Don't say anything. 
Geneviève will decide for herself. 
You're not asleep? 
You can see that. 
Roland Cassard asked for your hand. 
I heard. 
You didn't tell him I'm pregnant? 
I didn't dare. 
I'm very proud of you. 
François is a pretty name for a boy. 
Time passes slowly here. 
Furloughs have been suspended, and I don't know if I'll be returning to France very soon. 
My love, I know you're waiting for me. 
Last night, one of our patrols fell into an ambush. 
Three soldiers were killed. 
All the same, I don't think that there's great danger here. 
But it is strange how sun and death travel together. 
Geneviève, come to dinner, darling. 
Dear Mr. Cassard, we greatly appreciated your postcard, 
Mother and I. 
I find these people ridiculous. 
I hate the carnival. 
It's incredible how big you are! 
You're carrying in front. 
It will be a boy, or twins. 
No, everything is normal. 
I feel wonderful. 
You're like me. 
I was delighted, never sick. 
The day before you were born, I was up on a ladder, changing the wallpaper in the shop. 
Has the postman come? 
There were only bills and some advertising. 
Why? 
In his last letter, he wrote he was sad because he wouldn't see me pregnant. 
And perhaps it's just as well. 
I look awful. 
A pregnant woman is always beautiful, my darling. 
That's true. 
Look at this. 
A vest. And I saw pretty rompers at the department store. 
Admit that you're pleased. 
I'd be more pleased if that child had a father, and if you had a husband. 
Guy will return. 
Guy or someone else. 
Absence is a funny thing. 
It feels as if Guy left years ago. 
I look at this picture, and I forget what he really looks like. 
And when I think of him, it's this picture that I see. 
It's all I have left of him. 
Don't smoke. 
What's that? 
A postcard from Hamburg. 
From Roland Cassard. 
For me? 
For us. 
You may read it. He says he'll be back soon. 
He asks if you've thought it over. 
It doesn't seem to me there's any hurry. 
No, but you must think it over. 
I am thinking it over, Mother. 
Here's a man, rich, refined, and enamored of you, and I think... 
What are you doing? 
Aren't you feeling well? 
I'm all right, Mother. 
You're eating. I can't help it. 
I'm always hungry. 
He's not a womanizer, a smooth talker on the prowl, but a man who has lived and suffered. 
I know, Mother, but don't give me a sales talk. 
You praise him like you praise your umbrellas. 
Because he'll protect you, Geneviève. 
Very funny. If you can't take a little humor, you're lost! 
Guy might have been your ideal, but what future did he offer you? 
You know, I too was once wooed by a young man who was not your father. 
You'd have done better to marry him. 
You're right. 
But understand that I want you to be happy and not ruin your life the way I ruined mine. 
Don't worry about my life, Mother. 
I have no intention whatsoever of ruining it. 
Do you think Cassard will want to marry me when he sees I'm knocked up? 
Watch your language! 
Deformed! 
Bloated! 
Since neither you nor I had the courage to confess the truth to him, now, at least, it will show! 
Do you believe he'll take me like this? 
If he refuses me as I am, it means he doesn't have deep feelings for me. 
But if, by some unlikely chance, he accepts me, 
I'll have no reason to doubt him, and I'd be a fool to reject him. 
So, you see, I'm thinking it over. 
But all this is so difficult. 
Why is absence so heavy to bear? 
Why is Guy fading away from me? 
I would have died for him. 
Why aren't I dead? 
Look. What is it? 
It's for you. 
Roland sent it for you. 
I can't accept it. 
Do as you like. 
We'll bring this child up together. 
He'll be our child. 
Please say yes, 
Geneviève. 
I don't want all this to upset you in the least. 
I love you, 
Geneviève. 
She accepts, since her present condition doesn't frighten you. 
But don't rush her. 
She's so fragile that the slightest mistake could compromise everything. 
PART THREE 
- THE RETURN 
NEW OWNER 
Madeleine told me everything. 
I didn't want to. I thought you knew. 
Didn't you suspect anything? 
Over the last few months, her letters weren't the same. 
She didn't answer my questions. 
She wrote without conviction. 
But from there to marrying another man! 
No, I thought she was mad at me, but I didn't know why. 
Then there was the hospital and my letters that went unanswered. 
Here nothing has changed. 
I have. 
I can let go now that you're here. 
I would have been so unhappy not to see you again. 
Don't talk nonsense. 
Come on, make yourself useful, my boy. 
Give me some herb tea. 
Everything's ready in the kitchen. 
There's water in the kettle. 
Something wrong with your leg? 
You see, I limp a little. 
It's like having a barometer in my knee. 
Especially when it rains. 
It was in the hospital that I suffered the most. 
But how did it happen? 
Returning one night from maneuvers. 
We were attacked. 
Hand grenades. 
It happened often. 
What about Madeleine? 
She's coming. 
She's been very good to me. 
Isn't she married yet? 
You know how well-behaved she is. 
Put it over there on the table. 
What will you do now? 
Work. 
Or maybe live off my pension. 
Aubin promised to take you back. 
You liked his gas station. 
Oh, his or someone else's. 
We'll see. 
I have time. There's no hurry. 
The child she was expecting... do you know anything about it? 
No. 
Geneviève left just after the wedding. 
Mrs. Emery stayed in Cherbourg a month or two. 
Then she sold the shop. 
I think they're in Paris. 
You haven't changed. 
I'm happy that you've returned. 
Did you service this gentleman's car? 
Complete checkup on the 26th, right, sir? Two thrown rods this morning. 
The engine is dead. 
A brand-new engine. Not a drop of oil! 
I'm not blaming anyone, but that's it. 
I'm real sorry. 
Did you check the oil gauge? 
Of course. 
You forgot to screw the cap on. I know my job. 
Don't talk to me like that! 
And apologize to the gentleman. 
I don't have to. It wasn't my fault. 
You don't give a damn about your work. Why don't you buy some new overalls? 
And shave before you come to work! 
I've had enough. 
Since he got out of the army, he acts like a hoodlum. That stupid ass. 
What's going on? 
I'm quitting. 
I had a fight with Aubin and quit before he could fire me. 
What will you do? 
Take it out of this. 
Don't you have anything smaller? 
You're all the same, with your big bills. 
What of it, you bum? 
Just do your job and lay off! 
What are you looking for? 
Then move your ass. 
Something wrong, baby? 
Come with me if you want. 
You're really a sweet girl. 
Evening, Madame Germaine. 
You can call me Geneviève if you'd like. 
You're going to say I remind you of someone. 
Good-bye, Jenny. 
Sorry, Madeleine. 
What's the matter? 
Elise died last night. 
I can't stay any longer in this apartment. 
I'm too unhappy. I want to leave soon. 
But where will you go? 
I don't know. 
You have no family. Don't you want to stay here? 
What would I do? 
You'd help me. I'll be lonely. 
You don't need anyone. 
I need you, Madeleine. 
Why don't you just say you don't like being alone? 
I don't see what I could do for you. 
I have no influence over you. 
That's not true. 
I don't like what you've become. 
You hang about with nothing to do. 
You're sad and bitter. You've changed a lot. 
It's not my fault. 
Since I came back, things don't make sense anymore. 
I don't think I can help you. 
You're too far away. 
What if I asked you to try despite everything? 
I wouldn't hesitate to stay. 
I'm asking you. 
Then I'll try. 
I'm a bit late. 
The lawyer took forever, and I stopped by the garage. 
Now everything is settled. 
Poor Elise. Nothing will be left of her. 
On the contrary. 
She'll be part of everything we do. 
Are you happy? 
Very. 
And it's all thanks to you. Madeleine, you know it's true. 
And you? 
Are you happy? I'm not unhappy. 
I wanted to tell you... 
That is, I've been thinking that if you wanted to share my life... if I weren't too much of a burden... and that... 
Are you crying? 
Did I say something wrong? 
Not at all... but it makes me so happy, and at the same time, it scares me. 
You're scared of me? 
No... a little... well... you understand... 
Have you given up thinking about Geneviève? 
Are you sure you really love me? 
I'm not scared, but I wonder if you're not acting out of despair. 
You're quite wrong. I don't want to think about Geneviève anymore. 
I assure you, I've forgotten everything. 
I want to be happy with you. 
Madeleine, don't cry. 
I don't have much ambition... but if I could make this dream come true : 
To be happy with a woman... in a life we've chosen together... 
I'm done. 
It's very beautiful. 
Your hands are cold. 
I'm going out now. 
If you want. 
Our son would like to see the toys in the store windows. 
He's been talking about it all week. 
I'll take him for a look before dinner. 
Stop that, will you? François, you'll make us deaf! 
I got you a lovely Christmas present. 
What is it? 
It's a surprise. 
Bundle up. 
I love you, Guy. 
François, come and put your coat on. 
Say hello to Santa Claus for me. 
Françoise, stop that. 
The horn isn't a toy. 
It's cold. 
Come into the office. 
It's warmer here. 
This is my first time back in Cherbourg since I got married. 
I went to pick up my daughter at my mother-in-law's in Anjou. 
On the way back to Paris, 
I decided to make a detour. 
I never thought I'd run into you. 
It's pure chance. 
Does madame want me to fill it up? 
Geneviève... 
Yes, fill it up. 
Super or regular? It doesn't matter. 
Which do you want? 
This is a pretty tree. 
Did you decorate it? 
No, my wife did. It's mostly for the kid. 
Of course. 
Are you in mourning? 
Mother died last autumn. 
What did you name her? 
Françoise. 
She's a lot like you. 
Do you want to see her? 
I think you're all set. 
Are you all right? 
Yes, I'm fine. 
Many strange legends are told Of these jungles of India... but none so strange as the story of a small boy named Mowgli. 
It all began when the silence Of the jungle was broken by an unfamiliar sound. 
It was a sound like one never heard before in this part of the jungle. 
It was a man cub! 
Had I known how deeply I was to be involved... 
I would've obeyed my first impulse and walked away. 
This man cub would have to have nourishment, and soon. 
It was many days travel to the nearest man village... and without a mother's care, he would soon perish. 
Then it occurred to me. 
A family of wolves I knew had been blessed with a litter of cubs. 
Oh, I knew there'd be no problem with the mother thanks to the maternal instinct, but... 
I wasn't so sure about Rama, the father. 
Ten times the rains had come and gone. 
And I often stopped by to see how Mowgli the man cub was getting along. 
He was a favorite of all the young wolf cubs of the pack. 
No man cub was ever happier. 
And yet, I knew that someday... he would have to go back to his own kind. 
Then one night, the wolf pack elders met at council rock... because Shere Khan the tiger... had returned to their part of the jungle. 
This meeting was to change the man cub's entire future. 
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy and all who try to protect him. 
Now, are we all in agreement as to what must be done? 
Now it is my unpleasant duty to tell the boy's father. 
Rama. Uh, come over here, please. 
- Yes, Akela? 
- The council has reached its decision. 
The man cub can no longer stay with the pack. 
- He must leave at once. 
- Leave? 
I'm sorry, Rama. 
There is no other way. 
But- 
- But the man cub is- - Well, he's like my own son. 
Surely he's entitled to the protection of the pack. 
But, Rama, even the strength of the pack is no match for the tiger. 
But the boy cannot survive alone in the jungle. 
Akela. 
Perhaps I can be of help. 
You, Bagheera? 
How? 
I know of a man village where he'll be safe. 
Mowgli and I have taken many walks into the jungle together, so I'm sure he'll go with me. 
So be it. 
Now there's no time to lose. 
Good luck. 
Bagheera. 
I'm getting a little sleepy. 
Shouldn't we start back home? 
Mowgli, this time we're not going back. 
- I'm taking you to a man village. 
- But why? 
Because Shere Khan has returned to this part of the jungle. 
And he has sworn to kill you. 
Kill me? 
But why would he wanna do that? 
He hates man. 
And Shere Khan is not going to allow you to grow up to become a man- - just another hunter with a gun. 
Aw, we'll just explain to him that I'd never do a thing like that. 
Nonsense. 
No one explains anything to Shere Khan. 
Well, maybe so. 
But I'm not afraid. 
- And besides, I- - 
- Now that's enough. 
We'll spend the night here. 
Things will look better in the morning. 
Man cub? 
Man cub! 
Now come on, up this tree. 
Be safer up there. 
I don't wanna go back to the man village. 
Go on. 
Up you go. 
- That limb way up there? 
- That's right. 
Is that all the better you can climb? 
I- - Oh- 
- It's too big around. 
And besides, I don't have any claws. 
Now, get some sleep. 
We've got a long journey ahead of us tomorrow. 
I- 
- I wanna stay in the jungle. 
Huh? 
You wouldn't last one day. 
I'm not afraid. 
I-I can look out for myself. 
Say now, what have we here? 
It's a man cub. 
A delicious man cub. 
Oh, go away and leave me alone. 
Oh, that's just what I should do, but I'm not. 
Now, now, please go to sleep, man cub. 
Yes, man cub. 
Please go to sleep. 
Please go to sleep 
Sleep, little man cub 
Rest in peace 
Sleep. 
Sleep. 
Ba- 
- Ba-Bagh-gheera. 
Oh, now- 
- Now look, there's no use arguing any more. 
Oh! 
Now no more talk till morning. 
He won't be here in the morning. 
Hmm? 
Oh, yes, he will. 
I- 
- Kaa! 
Hold it, Kaa! 
Oh! 
My sinus. 
You have just made a serious mistake, my friend. 
A very stupid... 
- Now, now, now, now, Kaa, I was- - - mistake. 
Look me in the eye when I'm speaking to you. 
- Oh, please, Kaa. 
- Both eyes, if you please. 
You have just sealed your doom. 
Look, Bagheera! 
Look, Bagheera. 
Wake up, Bagheera. 
Just you wait till I get you in my coils. 
Bagheera, he's got a knot in his tail! 
" He's got a knot in his tail." 
Ooh, this is going to slow down my slither. 
So, you can look out For yourself, can you? 
So you want to stay in the jungle, do you? 
Yes. 
I wanna stay in the jungle. 
Oh! 
Now, now, now for the last time, go to sleep! 
Man cub. 
Man cub. 
A parade. 
Oh, no! 
The dawn patrol again. 
Company, sound off! 
Hello. 
What are you doing? 
Shh! 
Drilling. 
- Can I do it too? 
- Sure. Just do what I do. 
But don't talk in ranks. 
It's against regulations. 
To the rear! 
March! 
The other way. 
Turn around. 
To the rear! 
Ho! 
Company, halt! 
That means stop. 
Company, left face! 
March, march, march. 
My feet are killing me. 
I'm puttin' in for a transfer to another herd. 
Silence in the ranks! 
Dress up that line. 
Pull it in, Winifred. 
Inspection! 
Arms! 
Stick your nose out. 
- Like this? 
- That's right. 
A dusty muzzle. 
Soldier, remember, in battle, that trunk can save your life. 
- Take good care of it, my man. 
- Yes, sir! 
Very good. 
Cary on. 
- Let's have a little more spit and polish on those bayonets. 
Esprit de corps. 
That's the way I earned my commission in the Maharajah's fifth pachyderm brigade. 
Back in' 88, it was. Uh, or was it? 
Here it comes. 
The Victoria Cross bit again. 
It was then I received the Victoria Cross... for bravely above and beyond the call of duty. 
Those were the days. 
Discipline. 
Discipline was the thing. 
Builds character, and all that sort of thing, you know. 
Oh, oh, where was I? 
Oh, yes. 
Inspection. 
Well, very good. 
Wipe off that silly grin, soldier. 
This is the army. 
Eyes front. 
Lieutenant, that haircut is not regulation. 
Rather on the gaudy side, don't you think? 
There. 
That's better. 
And as for you- - 
Oh, there you are. 
Let's keep those heels together, shall we, son? 
Okay, Pop. 
Sir. 
Yes, now that's better. 
Well, a new recruit, eh? 
I say, what happened to your trunk? 
Hey! 
Stop that! 
A man cub! 
Oh, this is treason! 
Sabotage! 
I'll have no man cub in my jungle! 
- I-It's not your jungle! 
- Hold it! 
Hold it! 
I can explain, Hathi. 
Colonel Hathi, If you please, sir. 
Oh, yes, yes. 
Colonel Hathi. 
Uh, the man cub is with me. 
I'm taking him back to the man village. 
- To stay? 
- You have the word of Bagheera. 
Good. 
And remember, an elephant never forgets. 
I don't know what the army's coming to these days. 
These young whippersnappers, who do they think they are? 
Let's get on with it! 
Right face! 
Forward march! 
Dear, haven't you forgotten something? 
Nonsense, Winifred old girl. 
An elephant never forgets. 
Well, you just forgot our son. 
Uh, uh, son- 
- Son? 
Son! 
Oh, yes, yeah, yeah! 
Quite right. 
To the rear! 
March! 
When I grow up, I'm gonna be a Colonel, just like my- - 
- If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times- - 
- Oh! 
Pop! 
Look out! 
Gee, Pop, you forgot to say" halt." 
He said an elephant never forgets. 
It's not funny. 
Now let's get out of here quick before anything else happens. 
Bagheera! 
Where are we goin'? 
You're going back to the man village right now. 
- I'm not going. 
- Oh, yes, you are! 
I'm staying right here! 
You're going if I have to drag you every step of the way. 
- Let go, you- - 
- You let go of me! 
Oh, that does it. 
I've had it, man cub! 
From now on, you're on your own alone! 
Don't worry about me. 
Foolish man cub. 
Well, now. 
What have we here? 
Hey, what a funny little bit of a- - 
- Oh! 
- Go away! 
Oh, boy, I've seen everything in these woods. 
Hoo! 
What have I run on? 
What a pretty thing this is. 
- Leave me alone. 
- Well, now. 
That's pretty big talk, little britches. 
I'm big enough. 
Pitiful. 
Hey, kid, you need help. 
And old Baloo's gonna learn you to fight like a bear. 
Now come on, I'm gonna show you. 
Yeah! 
All right, now, kid, loosen up. 
Get real loose and then start to weave. 
Weave a little. 
Now move! 
That's it! 
Now give me a big bear growl. 
Scare me. 
Oh, boy. 
I'm talkin' about like a big bear. 
He's in trouble! 
Why, I-I shouldn't have left him alone. 
- A big one. 
Right from your toes. 
- How's that? 
- Yeah, you're gettin' it, kid. 
- Oh, no! 
It's Baloo. 
That shiftless, stupid jungle bum. 
Weave about now and look for an opening. 
Keep movin'. 
Keep- - 
Yeah, you're gettin' it, kid. 
Come on, that's it. 
He's a dandy. 
Fine teacher you are, old iron paws. 
- Oh, thanks, Bagheera. 
- Eh, tell me, tell me, uh... after you knock your pupil senseless, uh, how do you expect him to remember the lesson? 
Hmm? 
Well, I- 
- I, uh- 
- Well, I didn't mean to lay it on him so hard. 
I'm not hurt. 
I'm all right. 
I'm a lot tougher than some people think. 
You better believe it. 
Now let's go once more. 
Now I want you to keep circlin' or I'm gonna knoc kyour roof in again. 
You better keep movin'. 
Hey! 
Right on the button. 
No, no-no, no-no. 
Now you're tickling'. 
No! 
No. 
N-N-Now, now we don't do that here in the jungle. 
No, you're tickling'. 
I-I can't stand that tickling'. 
- Help, Bagheera! 
- Oh, boy, that's all he needs. 
More confidence. 
- Give up, Baloo? 
- I give up, I told ya. 
Ooh! 
I give- 
- Hey! 
You know somethin'? 
You're all right, kid. 
What do they call you? 
Mowgli. 
And he's going back to the man village right now. 
Man village? 
They'll ruin him. 
They'll make a man out of him. 
Oh, Baloo, I wanna stay here with you. 
Certainly you do. 
Oh? 
And just how do you think he will survive? 
" How do you think he will- -" What do you mean," How do you think he- -" 
He's with me, ain't he? 
And I'll learn him all I know. 
Well, that shouldn't take too long. 
Look, now it's like this, little britches. 
All you've gotta do is- - 
You eat ants? 
You better believe it. 
And you're gonna love the way they tickle. 
Mowgli, look out! 
- Have I given you a clue? 
- Golly. 
Thanks, Baloo. 
Pawpaw. 
Of all the silly gibberish. 
Come on, Baghee, get with the beat. 
How' bout scratching' that ol' left shoulder while you're up there, Mowgli? 
Now just a hair lower. There. 
Right there. 
That's it. 
Oh! 
This is beautiful. 
That's good. 
Kid, we've got to get to a tree. 
This calls for some big scratching'. 
You're lots of fun, Baloo. 
Right on it. 
Yeah! 
That's delicious. 
Just a little bit- - 
Yeah! 
Yeah. 
Oh, man, this is really livin'. 
So just try and relax. 
Yeah. 
Cool it. 
Fall apart in my backyard. 
'Cause let me tell you somethin', little britches. 
If you act like that bee acts... uh-uh, you're workin' too hard. 
And don't spend your time lookin' around... for something you want that can't be found. 
I give up. 
Well, I hope his luck holds out. 
Mowgli, how' bout you sing? 
- Yeah! - With just the bare necessities of life 
Yeah, man! 
Beautiful! 
That's real jungle harmony. 
- I like being a bear. 
- That's my boy. 
And you're gonna make one swell bear. 
Why, you even sing like one. 
Hey, Mowgli, how' bout you flicking' that old, mean fly... of fo' your papa bear's nose? 
Ouch! 
Boy, when you flick a fly, you really- - 
Why you flat-nosed, little-eyed, flaky creep! 
Hey! 
Let go of me! 
Take your flea-pickin' hands Of fo' my cub! 
Come on and get him, champ! 
- He ain't no champ. 
He's a chump! 
- Baloo! 
Yeah! 
A big hothead! 
Okay, you guys asked for it. 
I'll- - 
That'll cool him off. 
Gimme back my man cub! 
Here he is. 
Come and get him! 
That's how a bear can rest at ease. 
Here's some bare necessities. 
Now just try that again, you- - 
- What's that you hit him with, son? 
- That was a bare necessity. 
Look, monk, you turn him loose or I'll jerk a knot in your tail- - 
We give up! 
Here he comes! 
Baloo! 
Catch me! 
- Baloo! 
- Back up! 
Back up! 
Faster! 
Faster! 
Faster! 
A rolling bear gathers no hair! 
Baloo! 
Help me! 
Baloo, they're carrying me away! 
Bagheera! 
Bagheera! 
Well, it's happened. 
Took a little longer than I thought, but it's happened. 
Bagheera! 
Oh, you heard me, huh? 
Mowgli. Mowgli! 
All right, what happened? 
Where's Mowgli? 
They ambushed me. 
Thousands of'em. 
I jabbed with my left. 
Then I swung with a right. 
And then I let- - 
Oh, for the last time, what happened to Mowgli? 
Like I told ya, them mangy monkeys carried him off. 
The ancient ruins. 
Oh, I hate to think what'll happen when he meets that king of theirs. 
- We got him, King Louie! 
- Here he is. 
Man, we got him. 
We got him! 
So you're the man cub. 
Crazy. 
I'm not as crazy as you are. 
Put me down! 
You cut that out! 
Cool it, boy. 
Unwind yourself. 
Now come on, let's shake, cousin. 
What do you want me for? 
Word has grabbed my royal ear- - Have a banana- - that you wanna stay in the jungle. 
Stay in the jungle? 
I sure do. 
Well, good. 
And old King Louie- - 
That's me- - can fix it for you. 
Have two bananas. 
- Have we got a deal? 
- Yes, sir. 
I'll do- 
- I'll do anything to stay in the jungle. 
Well, then. 
I'll lay it on the line for you. 
What? 
Gee, Cousin Louie, you're doin' real good. 
Now here's your part Of the deal, cuz. 
Lay the secret on me of man's red fire. 
But I don't know how to make fire. 
Fire? 
So that's what that scoundrel's after. 
I'll tear him limb from limb. 
I'll beat him. 
I'll- 
- I'll- - 
Yeah! 
Well, man, what a beat. 
Will you stop that silly beat business and listen? 
This will take brains, not brawn. 
You better believe it, and I'm loaded with both. 
- Will you listen? - Oh. 
Yeah, yeah. 
Now, while you create a disturbance... 
I'll rescue Mowgli. 
Got that? 
I'm gone, man. 
Solid gone. 
Not yet, Baloo! 
Hey! 
Get mad, baby. 
Take me home, daddy! 
- One more time! - Yeah, can learn to be 
- Man! 
- It's Baloo, the bear! 
Yeah, that's him! 
How'd that square get in there? 
Baloo, it's you! 
Man, that's what I call a swingin' party. 
And furthermore, Baloo... 
Mowgli seems to have man's ability to get into trouble. 
And your influence hasn't been exactly- - 
Shh. 
Keep it down. 
You're gonna wake up little buddy. 
- Dah. 
- Well, he's had a big day. 
It was a real sockaroo. 
You know, it ain't easy learning' to be like me. 
Pah! 
A disgraceful performance. 
Associating with those undesirable, scatterbrained apes. 
Unh. 
I hope Mowgli learned something from that experience. 
Scooby-dooby, dooby-doo. 
That's my boy. 
Oh, nonsense. 
Baloo. 
Over here. 
I'd like to have a word with you. 
A word? 
You gonna talk some more? 
All right, what's up, Bagheera? 
Baloo... the man cub must go back to the man village. 
The jungle is not the place for him. 
I grew up in the jungle. 
Take a look at me. 
Yes, just look at yourself. 
Look at that eye. 
Yeah. 
It's beautiful, ain't it? 
Yeah. 
Frankly, you're a disreputable sight. 
Well, you don't look exactly like a basket off ruit yourself. 
Ohh. 
Baloo, you can't adopt Mowgli as your son. 
Why not? 
H-H-How can I put it? 
It- 
- Baloo... birds of a feather should flock together. 
You wouldn't marry a panther, would you? 
I don't know. 
Come to think of it, no panther ever asked me. 
No. 
Baloo, you-you've got to be serious about this. 
Oh, stop woryin', Baghee. 
Stop woryin'. 
I'll take care of him. 
Yes. 
Like you did when the monkeys kidnapped him, huh? 
- Can't a guy make one mistake? 
- Not in the jungle. 
And another thing. 
Sooner or later, Mowgli will meet Shere Khan. 
The tiger? 
What's he got against the kid? 
He hates man with a vengeance. 
You know that. 
Because he fears man's gun and man's fire. 
But little Mowgli don't have those things. 
Shere Khan won't wait until he does. 
He'll get Mowgli while he's young and helpless. 
- Just one swipe and- - 
- No. 
Well- 
- Well, what are we gonna do? 
- We'll do what's best for the boy. 
- You better believe it. 
You name it, and I'll do it. 
Good. 
Then make Mowgli go to the man village. 
Are you out of your mind? 
I promised him... he could stay here in the jungle with me. 
Well, that's just the point. 
As long as he remains with you... he's in danger, so it's up to you. 
- Why me? 
- Be-Be-Because he won't listen to me. 
I love that kid. 
I love him like he was my own cub. 
Then think of what's best for Mowgli and not yourself. 
Uh, well, can't- 
- Well, can't I wait until morning? 
It's morning now. 
Go on, Baloo. 
Uh- - 
Oh, boy. 
Mowgli. 
Mowgli. 
Uh, it's time to get up. 
Oh. 
Hi, Baloo. 
Hi. 
Hey, rub that old sleep out of your eyes. 
You and me, uh, we got a long walk ahead of us. 
Swell. 
Gee, we'll have lots of fun together. 
Sure. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Uh- - 
All right, let's hit the trail, kid. 
See ya around, uh, Bagheera. 
Well, goodbye, Bagheera. 
Me and Baloo, we've got things to do. 
Goodbye, man cub. 
And good luck. 
Come on, Baloo. 
All we gotta do is- - 
I like bein' a bear. 
- Where we goin', Baloo? 
- Well, uh, it's, uh- - 
Um, well, it's sort of new and, uh- - 
Oh, I don't care, as long as I'm with you. 
Mowgli, uh, look, buddy, uh... there's somethin I gotta tell ya. 
Tell me what, Baloo? 
Gee whiz. 
Now how did old Baghee put it? 
It's, uh- - 
Uh, uh, Mowgli? 
Ha! 
You wouldn't marry a panther, would you? 
Gee, I don't even know what you're talkin' about. 
Mowgli, don't you realize that you're a human? 
I'm not any more, Baloo. 
I'm a bear like you. 
Little buddy, look, listen to me. 
- Come on. 
Come on, Baloo. 
- Now, Mowgli, stop it now. 
Now hold still. 
I-I want to tell you something. 
Now listen to me. 
- What's the matter, old Papa Bear? 
- Look, Mowgli... 
I been tying' to tell ya. 
I been tying' all morning to tell ya. 
I've got to take you back to the man village. 
- The man village! 
- Now look, kid... 
- I can explain, and- - 
- But, but you said we were partners. 
- Now believe me, kid, I-I-I- - 
- You're just like, like old Bagheera! 
Now just a minute. 
That's goin' too far. 
Hey, Mowgli, where you goin'? 
Wait a minute! 
Stop! 
Wait! 
Wait! 
Listen to old Baloo. 
Mowgli. Mowgli! 
Mowgli! 
- Mowgli. Mowgli! 
- Now what's happened? 
Well, you, you, you're not gonna believe me, Bagheera... but look, now I used the same words you did, and he ran out on me. 
Well, don't just stand there. 
Let's separate. 
We- 
- We've got to find him. 
Oh, if anything happens to that little guy... 
I'll never forgive myself. 
I gotta find him. 
Mowgli! 
Mowgli. 
What beastly luck. 
Confound that ridiculous Colonel Hathi. 
Company, sound off. 
The jungle patrol. 
Stop! 
W-Wait a minute. 
Halt! 
Who said halt? 
I give the commands around here. 
- Now speak up. 
Who was it? 
- Oh, it was me, Colonel. 
What do you mean, sir, taking over my command? 
- Highly irregular, you know. 
- Oh, Colonel, I-I'm sorry... 
- but, but I need your help. 
- Oh, absolutely impossible. 
- We're on a cross-county march. 
- But it's an emergency, Colonel. 
- The man cub must be found. 
- Man cub? 
What man cub? 
- How interesting. 
- The one I was taking to the man village. 
Good. 
That's where he belongs. 
Now, sir, If you don't mind... we'd like to get on with the march. 
No, no, no, you, you don't understand, Hathi. 
He is lost. 
He ran away. 
How delightful. 
Well, serves the young whippersnapper right. 
But, but Shere Khan, the tiger- - 
He's sure to pick up the man cub's trail. 
Shere Khan. 
Nonsense, old boy. 
Shere Khan isn't within miles of here. 
Oh, sorry, Bagheera. 
Fortunes of war, and all that sort of thing, you know. 
This has gone far enough. 
Far enough. 
Now just a minute, you pompous old windbag. 
Winifred! 
What are you doing out of ranks? 
Never mind. 
How would you like to have our boy... lost and alone in the jungle? 
Our son? 
W-Well- - 
But, Winifred old girl, that's an entirely different matter. 
- Huh! 
- Different, entirely. 
That little boy is no different than our own son. 
Now you help find him, or I'm taking over command. 
What! 
A female leading my herd? 
Utterly preposterous. 
Pop? 
The man cub and I are friends. 
He'll get hurt If we don't find him. 
Please, Pop? 
Sir? 
Please? 
Now don't you worry, son. 
Your father had a plan in mind all the time. 
Sure you did. 
Troopers! 
Company, left face! 
Volunteers for a special mission... will step one pace forward. 
That's what I like to see. 
Devotion to duty. 
Now, you volunteers will find the lost man cub. 
Oh, thank you, Colonel. 
Now there's no time to lose. 
Yes, yes. 
Well, bugler. 
When the man cub is sighted, you will sound your trumpet... 
- three times. 
- Yes, sir. 
Not now, soldier. 
Sorry, sir. 
Lieutenant, our strategy shall be the element of surprise. 
You will take one squad... 
- and cover the right flank. 
- Yes, sir. 
And I shall lead the other squad... on the left flank. 
Very well. 
Company... forward march! 
Element of surprise? 
Oh, I say. 
And now for my rendezvous with the little lost man cub. 
Kaa! 
It's you! 
Yes, man cub. 
So nice to see you again. 
Oh, go away. 
Leave me alone. 
Let me look at you. 
You don't want me to look at you? 
Then you look at me. 
No, sir. 
I know what you're tryin' to do, Kaa- - 
You do? 
Uh, I mean... 
- you don't trust me. 
- No. 
Then there's nothing I can do to help. 
You wanna help me? 
Certainly. 
I can see to it that you never have to leave this jungle. 
How could you do that? 
Oh, I have my own... subtle little ways. 
But first, you must trust me. 
I don't trust anyone any more. 
I don't blame you. 
I'm not like those so-called... fair-weather friends of yours. 
You can believe in me. 
You're snoring. 
Sorry. 
Oh, now what? 
I'll be right down. 
Yes? 
Yes? 
Who is it? 
It's me, Shere Khan. 
I'd like a word with you If you don't mind. 
Shere Khan. 
What a surprise. 
Yes, isn't it? 
I just dropped by. 
Forgive me if I've interrupted anything. 
Oh, no, no, nothing at all. 
I thought perhaps you were entertaining someone up there in your coils. 
Coils? 
Someone? 
Oh, no. 
I was just curling up for my siesta. 
But you were singing to someone. 
Who is it, Kaa? 
Uh, who? 
Oh, no. 
Well, I was just singing, uh, to myself. 
- Indeed. 
- Yes. Yes, you see... 
I have trouble with my sinuses. 
- What a pity. 
- Oh, you have no idea. 
It's simply terrible. 
I can't eat. 
I can't sleep. 
So I sing myself to sleep. 
You know, self-hypnosis. 
Let me show you how it works. 
No, I can't be bothered with that. 
I have no time for that sort of nonsense. 
Some other time perhaps? 
Perhaps. 
But at the moment I am searching for a man cub. 
Man cub? 
What man cub? 
The one who's lost. 
Now where do you suppose he could be? 
- Search me. 
- That's an excellent idea. 
I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me your coils, would you, Kaa? 
Uh, certainly not. 
Nothing here. 
And nothing in here. 
My sinuses. 
Hmm. 
Indeed. 
And now, how about the middle? 
The middle? 
Oh, the middle. 
Absolutely nothing in the middle. 
Really? 
Well, if you do just happen to see the man cub... you will inform me first, understand? 
I get the point. 
Cross my heart, hope to die. 
Good show. 
And now I must continue my search for the helpless little lad. 
Ooh, who does he think he's fooling? 
" The helpless little lad." 
Ooh, he gives me the shivers. 
Picking on that poor little helpless boy. 
Oh, yes. 
Poor little helpless boy. 
You told me a lie, Kaa. 
You said I could trust you. 
It's like you said. 
You can't trust anyone. 
If I never see that skinny little shrimp again... it will be too soon. 
Ooh, my sacroiliac. 
Hey, Flaps, what we gonna do? 
I don't know. 
What you wanna do? 
I've got it! 
Let's flap over to the east side of the jungle. 
They've always got a bit of action, a bit of a swingin' scene all right. 
Ah, come off it. 
Things are right dead all over. 
You mean you wish they were. 
Very funny. 
Okay. 
So what we gonna do? 
I don't know. 
What do you wanna do? 
Look, Flaps, first I say," What we gonna do?" 
Then you say," I don't know. 
What you wanna do?" 
Then I say," What we gonna do?" You say," What you wanna do?" 
" What we gonna do?"" What you want- -" Let's do something! 
Okay. 
What you wanna do? 
Blimey. 
There you go again. 
The same notes again. 
I've got it! 
This time I've really got it. 
So you've got it. 
Then what we gonna do? 
Hold it, lads. 
Look. 
Look what's coming our way. 
Hey, what in the world is that? 
What a crazy-looking bunch of bones. 
Yeah, and they're all walking' about by themselves. 
Yeah. 
- So what we gonna do? 
- I don't know. 
Hey, now don't start that again! 
Let's have some fun with this little fella... this little blokey. Come on, lads. 
Come on. 
Blimey. 
He's got legs like a stork, he has. 
Like a stork. 
But he ain't got no feathers, he ain't. 
Go ahead. 
Laugh. 
I don't care. 
- What's wrong with him? 
- I think we overdid it. 
We were just having a bit Of fun, that's all. 
Oh, just look at him. 
Why, the poor little fella. 
You know, he must be down on his luck. 
Yeah, or he wouldn't be in our neighbourhood. 
Hey, new kid, wait a minute! 
Hey! 
- Just leave me alone. 
- Oh, come on. 
What's wrong? 
You know, you look like you haven't got a friend in the world. 
- I haven't. 
- Haven't you got a mother or a father? 
No. 
Nobody wants me around. 
Yeah, we know how you feel. 
Nobody wants us around either. 
Ah, we may look a bit shabby, but we've got heart. 
And feelings too. 
And just to prove it to you, we're gonna let you join our little group. 
Kid, we'd like to make you an honouray vulture. 
Thanks, but I- 
- I'd rather be on my own, alone. 
Aw, now look, kid. 
Eveybody's got to have friends. 
Hey, fellas, are we his friends? 
Ha-ha. 
You take it, kid. 
- Whoop, whoop. 
Take it easy, lads. - We'll keep you safe 
- Steady, steady. 
Watch it! 
- In the jungle 
Bravo, bravo. 
An extraordinary performance. 
And thank you for detaining my victim. 
Uh, do-don't mention it, Your Highness. 
- Boo. 
- Let's get out of here. 
Give me room! 
Gangway! 
Run, friend! 
Run! 
Run? 
Why should I run? 
Why should you run? 
Could it be possible that you don't know who I am? 
I know you, all right. 
You're Shere Khan. 
Precisely. 
Then you should also know... that everyone runs from Shere Khan. 
You don't scare me. 
I won't run from anyone. 
Ah. 
You have spirit for one so small. 
And such spirit is deserving Of a sporting chance. 
Now, I'm going to close my eyes and count to ten. 
It makes the chase more interesting... for me. 
One, two... three... four- - 
You're tying my patience. 
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! 
Run, Mowgli. 
Run! 
Let go, you big oaf. 
Take it easy. 
Take it- - Whoo! 
Ho-Hold it, hold it. 
Whoa. 
Slow down. 
Ooh! Yow! 
Whoa! 
Slow! Easy now. 
Ooh. 
Oh, boy. 
Easy. 
He's got a tiger by the tail, he has. 
And he'd better hang on too. 
Take that, ya big bully. 
Let him have it again, kid. 
Hit him again, kid. 
Go on! 
Baloo! 
Help me! 
Somebody do somethin with that kid. 
Come on, lads. 
He's safe now. 
You can let go, Baloo. 
Are you kiddin'? 
There's teeth in the other end. 
I'll kill you for this. 
Let go! 
Baloo needs help! 
Fire! 
That's the only thing old Stripes is afraid of. 
You get the fire. 
We'll do the rest. 
- Charge! 
- You there, punch and blow. 
Stay out of this, you mangy fools. 
Yeah, yeah. 
Missed me a mile, he did. 
- Yeah! 
- Yeah! 
Pull his blinking' whiskers. 
He's a bloomin' pussycat, he is. 
Look behind you, chum. 
Well, that's the last of him. 
Old Stripes took off like a flaming comet, he did. 
Well, come on. 
Let's go congratulate our friend. 
Hold it, fellas. 
Now's not the time for it. 
Look. 
Baloo? 
Baloo, get up. 
Oh, please get up. 
Mowgli, try to understand. 
Bagheera, what's the matter with him? 
You've got to be brave, like Baloo was. 
You- 
- You don't mean- - 
Oh, no. Baloo. 
Now, now. 
I know how you feel. 
But you must remember, Mowgli... greater love hath no one... than he who lays down his life for his friend. 
When great deeds are remembered in this jungle... one name will stand above all others- - our friend, Baloo, the bear. 
- He's crackin' me up. 
- The memory of Baloo's... sacrifice and bravey... will forever be engraved on our saddened hearts. 
- Beautiful. 
- This spot where Baloo fell... will always be a hallowed place in the jungle... for there lies one of nature's... noblest creatures. 
I wish my mother could've heard this. 
It's best we leave now. 
Come along, man cub. 
Hey, don't stop now, Baghee. 
You're doin' great! 
There's more, lots more. 
Why, you big fraud! 
You, you, you four-flusher! 
I-I'm fed up, and I-I- - 
Baloo! 
You're all right! 
Who, me? 
Sure I am. 
Never felt better. 
You sure had us worried. 
Ah, I was just takin' five. 
You know, playin' it cool. 
Yeah, but he was too easy. 
Good old Papa Bear. 
It's going to be a bit dull without the little bloke, isn't it? 
Yeah. 
So what we gonna do? 
I don't know. 
Hey, now, don't start that again! 
Hey, Baghee, too bad you missed the action. 
You should have seen how I made a sucker out of old Stripes with that left up in his face. 
Boom, boom, I was givin' him. 
Whang! 
You wanna know somethin'? 
We're good sparring' partners. 
You'd better believe it. 
Yes, sir. 
Nothin' or nobody is ever gonna come between us again. 
- Look. 
What's that? 
- Oh, it's the man village. 
No, no. 
I mean that. 
Forget about those. 
They ain't nothin' but trouble. 
Just a minute. 
I've never seen one before. 
So you've seen one. 
So let's go. 
I'll be right back. 
I want a better look. 
- Mowgli, wait a minute. 
- Ah, Baloo. 
Let him have a better look. 
She did that on purpose. 
Obviously. 
Mowgli, come back. 
Come back! 
Go on! 
Go on! 
He's hooked. 
Ah, it was inevitable, Baloo. 
The boy couldn't help himself. 
It was bound to happen. 
Mowgli is where he belongs now. 
Yeah... 
I guess you're right. 
But I still think he'd have made one swell bear. 
Well, come on, Baghee buddy. 
Let's get back to where we belong... and get with the beat. 
Beware the beastman, for he is the Devil's pawn. 
Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed. 
Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land. 
Let him not breeding great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. 
Shun him, for he is the harbinger of death. 
Nova. 
Where will you go? 
Follow the shoreline. 
Don't try to follow us. 
I'm pretty handy with this. 
All my life I've awaited your coming and dreaded it. 
You're afraid and you hate me. Why? 
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. 
Your greed made a desert of it ages ago. 
That doesn't tell me why. 
A planet where apes evolved from men? 
There's got to be an answer. 
Don't look for it, Taylor. 
You may not like what you find. 
Zira, Cornelius, untie me. 
What will he find out there, Doctor? 
His destiny. 
{ c : $ 0000ff } Beneath The Planet { c : $ 0000ff } Of The Apes 
Damn you all to hell! 
No, Skipper. 
It's me. 
J ust me. 
Brent... did you contact Earth? 
I tried to, sir. 
Not a crackle. 
Skipper... 
I took an Earth time reading just before reentry. 
What did you get? 
3955. 
3955? 
A.D. 
Almighty God. 
Well, we were following Taylor's trajectory. 
So whatever happened to us must have happened to him. 
What about us? 
Where... where are we? 
In my opinion, Skipper, we passed through a Haslein Curve, a bend in time. 
I don't know what planet we're on, but we're both here, we're breathing, we're conscious, we got plenty ofoxygen and water. 
We're going to be all right, Skipper. 
As soon as you feel better, we'll.. we'll run a navigational lesson. 
God, if I could only see the sun. 
It's up there all right. 
You can feel it. 
Yes... but which sun? 
I don't know. 
I don't know. 
Our computer's shot. 
We're lucky to be alive. 
Lucky? 
No. 
If it's 3955 A.D.... 
Oh, my God. 
My wife... my two daughters... dead. 
Everyone I ever knew. 
Everyone. 
Hey! 
Who are you? 
I.. 
Don't be afraid. 
I just... 
Just tell me where I am. 
Can you understand me? 
My name's Brent. 
Brent. 
I don't want to hurt you. 
I just want to know where I am. 
Where are you from? 
I mean, your people, where are they? 
How do I.. 
How do I get to them? 
Which way? 
Can you... 
Can you talk? 
Right, right, so you can't talk. 
Taylor! Taylor! 
Where is he? 
Taylor. Taylor. Taylor. 
Nova. Nova. 
Nova. Nova. Nova. 
Come on. 
That's the idea. 
Taylor. 
Nova. 
Here. 
Taylor. Taylor. 
Taylor. Taylor. 
OK, here's the prize. 
Go to the head of the class. 
Why don't we settle down and found a colony? 
The kids will learn to talk. 
Sure they will. 
Now, where in hell do we go from here? 
We might make it yet. 
Taylor. Taylor. Taylor. 
Just tell me what happened to him. 
Is he hurt? 
ls he alive? 
Where is he? 
It wasn't here. 
A minute ago, that wasn't here. 
I'm not the only one. 
She sees it, too. 
Listen. 
Listen now. 
If you lose me... 
If you lose me... me, try to find Zira. 
Remember? 
Zira. 
Go find Zira. 
Zira. 
This tag, did he give it to you? 
Where did you get this? 
Look, is there... is there someone... some other... someone who can talk? 
Look. 
You... take me... to Taylor. 
Taylor. 
Taylor now. 
Which way? 
My God, it's... 
It's a city ofapes. 
I'll tell you one thing every good soldier knows. 
The only thing that counts in the end is power. 
Naked, merciless force! 
Members of the Citizens' Council, 
I am a simple soldier, and as a soldier, I see things simply. 
I don't say all humans are evil simply because their skin is white. 
No. 
But our great Lawgiver tells us that never will the human have the ape's divine faculty for being able to distinguish between evil and good. 
The only good human is a dead human! 
It's a bloody nightmare. 
But those fortunate enough to remain alive will have the privilege of being used by our Minister ofScience, the good Dr. Zaius. 
Zira, stop. You're in danger. 
So is the future of science, with him fomenting a senseless military adventure. 
The Forbidden Zone has been closed for centuries, and rightly so. 
However, we now have evidence that that vast barren area is inhabited. 
By what or by whom we don't know, but if they live, and live they do, then they must eat. 
Now we must replenish the lands that were ravaged by the humans with new improved feeding grounds, and these grounds we can obtain in the once Forbidden Zone. 
It is our holy duty to enter it, to put the marks of our guns, wheels, and flags upon it! 
To expand the boundaries ofour ineluctable power. 
And to invade. 
Invade! Invade! Invade! 
As your husband, please, I beg you to stand. 
Only for my principles. 
All right, foryour principles and mine. 
Only please stand! 
I got to get out. I got to get back up there. 
I don't know how or what with, but I'm not staying here. 
General, I only pray you know what you're doing. 
How can you have any doubt? 
You're aware of reports we've been receiving ofstrange manifestations in the Forbidden Zone, manifestations which you, if I might add, as Minister ofScience, have been unable to fathom. 
12... 12 of my finest scouts just disappeared, vanished into thin air. 
11. 
Very well, 11... 11. 
And the 12th returned with incredible stories of huge walls of fire, strange violent earthquakes, his.. his mind gone, shattered no doubt by some unsimian torture. 
Well, General, 
I still think you're being hasty. 
No, Doctor. 
Decisive. 
Now we invade or we starve. 
It's as simple as that. 
And as dangerous. 
What is more dangerous than famine, Doctor? 
The unknown. 
If I had any proper sense of scientific purpose, Cornelius, 
I shouldn't be cutting up the healthy heads of humans. 
I should be dissecting the diseased brains of gorillas to find out what went wrong. 
And how would you put it right? 
I've wet-nursed their babies on the milk of chimpanzees and the milk of kindness. 
At least our child, when it's born, won't be breast-fed on bile. 
You know, my dear, the trouble with us intellectuals is we that have responsibilities and no power. 
I think I'll make chocolate icing. 
Do you like chocolate? 
What, dear? 
No, you don't. 
But I do. 
Ifwe had that power here in our hands, we'd be worse than them. 
I don't agree. 
Gorillas are cruel because they're stupid.. 
all bone and no brains. 
Zira, my dear, 
I wish you would not talk like that. 
Somebody is liable to hearyou. 
Nova! 
What are you doing here? 
Taylor? 
No, not Taylor. 
My name's Brent. 
You talked! 
That's impossible. 
In a whole lifetime devoted to the scientific study of humans, 
I've only found one other like you who could talk. 
Taylor. 
Is he alive? 
Have you seen him? 
Where? 
Where? 
Tell us. 
Where? 
Where? 
I don't know where. 
I'm trying to find him. 
The longer I stay, the less I care. 
Oh, now, we loved Taylor. 
He was a fine, a unique specimen. 
Why, if it had not been for Zira here, he.. he would still be here, a stuffed specimen in the great hall of the Zaius Museum, with his two friends. 
With his two friends? 
Well, I don't plan to stay around here quite that long. 
Look, can you get me some food, some.. some water, a map.. a map, so at least I'll have some idea where I'm heading? 
You'll want that taken care of, too. 
I'll get the map. 
Now, if you will look up here, ah, yes, towards the north. 
This was the last place that we saw Taylor. 
What is that damn stuff? 
You wouldn't know if I told you. 
J ust relax. 
Among other things, I'm a trained vet. 
Oh, great. 
Go on, go on. 
Taylor was riding with Nova here, between the lake and the sea. 
Yes, they were heading deep into the territory we call.. 
Yes, I know. The Forbidden Zone. 
Who told you that? 
Hmm? Your glorious leader back there. 
Quick! 
Cornelius, open the door. 
Put the things away. 
Open it! 
Dr. Zaius, how nice. 
We werejust about to have something to eat. 
Not until I talk some sense into your headstrong wife. 
Where is she? 
Good day, Dr. Zaius. 
Has there been an accident? 
Cornelius hit me for my bad behavior at the meeting. 
I don't blame him. 
I don't resent it, but his nails need clipping. 
Enough of this nonsense. 
Are you so blind, you two psychologists that you're unaware that we're on the verge ofa grave crisis? 
You heard Ursus' speech. 
Militaristic tripe. 
Zira! 
But now he has the incident he requires to go on a rampage ofconquest. 
But that is appalling! 
To remain silent while this bully Ursus is permitted to.. 
to destroy everything in his path is no longer possible. 
As Minister of science, it's my duty to find out whether some other form of life exists. 
Where are you going? 
Into the Forbidden Zone with Ursus. 
Another manhunt, Doctor? 
Someone or some thing has outwitted the intelligence of the gorillas. 
- That shouldn't be difficult. 
- Shh, Zira. 
We apes have learned to live in innocence. 
Let no one, be it man or some other creature, dare to contaminate that innocence. 
Why, is innocence so evil? 
Ignorance is! 
There's a time for truth. 
And the time is always now. 
Are you asking me to surrender my principles? 
I am asking you to be the guardians of the higher principles of science during my absence. 
I am asking for a truce with your personal convictions in an hour of public danger. 
And you shall have it, Dr. Zaius, or I shall hit her again. 
Let us have no violence, Cornelius. 
Now, I'm relying on you both. 
We are counting on you, too, Doctor. 
If I should fail to return from the unknown, the whole future ofour civilization may be yours to preserve or destroy, so think well before you act. 
Good-bye, Dr. Zaius, and good luck. 
Let me finish this up and get you out of here! 
Yeah, get me out of here, please. 
I've seen the delicate, humane way they treat humans here. 
I don't much care for it. 
Have you a horse? 
Yeah, out in the scrub. 
I'd better get you another set ofclothes, the kind fit for humans, like yourself. 
You'll pass. 
Get rid of this. 
And this, too. 
If you are caught by the gorillas, you must remember one thing. 
What's that? 
Never to speak. 
What the hell would I have to say to a gorilla? 
But you don't understand. 
Only apes can speak. 
Not her, and not you. 
If they catch you speaking, they will dissect you and they will kill you in that order. 
Cornelius is right. 
Be very careful. 
And get out of these things you're wearing as soon as you can. 
Thanks. 
Thank us by finding Taylor. 
Yeah, if he's still alive. 
Scissors. 
Sergeant, wait! 
This is a type-E cranium. 
Very unusual. 
With occipital development. 
Substandard lobe. 
Female. 
It's been a long time since we've been able to study specimens of such extraordinary clinical interest. 
Bring them inside. 
No! 
No, you can't have them. 
They are marked for target practice. 
Take them away. 
I'll take the key. 
To the target range! 
Uh, wait! 
Wait! 
I'd better double lock the door. 
Good luck. 
All right! 
God Almighty. 
This used to be my home. 
I... 
I lived here, worked here. 
What.. What happened? 
What.. What could've happened? 
My God, did we finally do it? 
Did we finally really do it? 
O God, bless, we pray You, our great army and its supreme commander on the eve of a holy war undertaken for Your sake, and grant, in the name of your Prophet, our great Lawgiver, 
that we, Your chosen servants, created and born in Your divine image, may aspire the more perfectly to that spiritual Godliness and bodily beauty which You, in Your infinite mercy, have thought fit to deny to our brutish enemies! 
So be it. 
There they go, 
Dr. Zaius trotting along beside them. 
Don't be too hard on the old boy, Zira. 
His motives are honest. 
He has only one motive.. to keep things exactly as they have always been. 
I say that it's time for a change. 
We chimpanzees are too few. 
How can we take initiative when they're in control? 
Love, yes! War, no! 
No more lies! 
No more crying! 
No more guns! 
No more blood! Stop! 
Stop! 
Stop the war! 
Freedom! 
Freedom! 
Whoa! 
Freedom! 
Peace! 
Peace and freedom! 
Get off the road, young people. 
Freedom! 
Peace! 
Get them out of the way. 
Wait. 
We don't want martyrs, do we? 
We want peace! 
We want freedom! 
Major, do it quietly. 
We want peace! 
We want freedom! 
Peace! 
Freedom! 
Peace! 
Freedom! 
Peace and freedom! 
Battalion. 
Are you what we were before we learned to talk and made a mess of everything? 
Did any good ever come from all that talk around all those tables? 
I wonder where the hell they are? 
I wonder where the hell we are? 
I think we're near the Forbidden Zone. 
That's where the army's headed. 
They'll roll right over us. 
Why can't we go back to our outfits? 
Because the sarge says to keep looking until we find them. 
Nova. 
Nova, Nova, wake up. 
We've got to go. 
Come on. 
That hum... 
You hear it, too? 
All right, come on, we're going to follow it. 
Well, whoever or whatever... something's guiding us. 
Whatever they are, they breathe air. 
Well, there's an intelligence working in this place. 
That sound, good or bad, it's either a warning or a directional device. 
It doesn't matter. 
They know we're here. 
Put my hands... around her throat. 
. Hold her throat! 
She... dies! 
Get out! 
Get out of my head! 
I reveal my inmost self unto my God. 
What did you say? 
What do you mean there's no point? 
Will they hurt her? 
No, maybe not physically, but here. 
Here, you can hurt here. 
Your lips... don't move. 
But I can hear. 
No, I mean... 
I know what you're thinking. 
Nothing. I... 
I saw nothing. 
Who are you? 
It's Brent. 
Who are you? 
Oh, I see. 
The only reality in the universe. 
That's nice to know. 
I got here by accident. 
How did you get here? 
You got it all wrong. 
Why would I want to spy on you? 
I'm not even sure you exist. 
Ofcourse I know who I am! 
I'm an astronaut! 
I was sent here on a rescue mission to find a fellow astronaut, Taylor. 
We're from this planet, but from another time, 
2,000 years ago. 
I know I... 
I know I sound insane. 
And it's my insanity. 
No, I don't know how to get back. 
We came through a defect, a slippage in time. 
That's what must have happened to Taylor. 
I'm sure he tried to get back. 
Yes, my Skipper is dead. I'm.. 
I'm alone. 
Who? 
Nova? 
What's that? 
Some star? A galaxy? 
What's Nova? 
All right, all right, yes! 
I know her. I know her. 
No, no. 
She's harmless. 
Let her alone. 
Tell me what you want to know. 
Tell me. 
She helped me to break out ofape city. 
No! Wait a minute! 
Stop it! 
I can't understand you. 
You're all screaming at me at the same time. 
I can't separate it! 
He's right. 
He has only limited intelligence. 
We should speak aloud, and one at a time. 
You were in the city of the apes? 
Yes, two days ago. 
What sights did you see? 
You're talking. 
Certainly we can talk. 
We use speech when we must. 
When we pray. 
When we sing to our God. 
You mean that.. that thing out there, an atomic bomb, your god? 
You don't understand. 
The Bomb is a holy weapon of peace. 
Holy weapon of peace! 
Peace. 
Mr. Brent, we're a patient people, but we are determined to know what the apes want.. 
war or peace. 
Try to understand. 
The only weapons we have are purely illusion. 
You just imagined that he hurt you. 
Traumatic hypnosis is a weapon of peace. 
Like the visual deterrent.. 
or the sonic deterrent.. 
Let me make a last appeal to your reason before we inflict more of this on you. 
These are weapons of peace, Mr. Brent. Like all our weapons. 
Mere illusions. 
Mere illusions? 
Damn your hypocrisy! 
Is that bomb out there, is that an illusion? 
It's operational, isn't it? 
The firing mechanism.. it's intact, isn't it? 
We very much need your help, Mr. Brent. 
Why? 
We are the keepers of the Divine Bomb. 
It is our only reason for survival. 
And yet, as you see, we are defenseless, defenseless against the slaughtering, monstrous, materialistic apes. 
I'll help nobody. 
So go ahead. Annihilate each other. 
I forgive you your language. 
Sometimes your sanity is about to give way. 
I hope that does not happen. 
I hope you can tell us.. 
Exactly what the apes are planning. 
We've caught some of their scouts. 
They're hideous creatures. 
We've had them here, standing precisely where you are now. 
Either their skulls were too thick, or they really knew nothing at all. 
Neither do I. Can't you understand that? 
I don't know anything! 
You make us very sad, Mr. Brent. 
She can't help you. 
She can't even talk. 
Don't harm her. 
We never harm anyone, Mr. Brent. 
You're going to harm her. 
The apes sent me out to you. 
You're lying. 
How do you know? 
How do you always know? 
Nova. 
Now.. 
Tell us of the apes. 
The apes... are marching on your city. 
Bugler, sound the advance. 
Ursus! 
Ursus, I warned you. 
Look what we're faced with! 
I told you you should wait! 
Brutal butchery! 
I swear, those responsible shall pay with torture and with death. 
If you have any pity, give orders to shoot our poor people. 
I can't order them to do what the Lawgiver has forbidden. 
Ape shall not kill ape. 
Hold your positions! 
He bleeds. 
The Lawgiver bleeds! 
The spirit of the Lawgiver lives! 
We are still God's chosen! 
This is a vision! 
And it is a lie! 
The vision was false! 
Bugler, sound the advance. 
Advance! 
Stupid animals. 
They don't have the brain to hold our illusions. 
We have no defense. 
Except our Bomb. 
Call our people to the high sanctuary. 
Do you know the range of their city? 
Yes. 
Set in the mechanism and wait for me. 
I want a public thought projection at adult and infant level. 
Adults to the cathedral, infants indoors. 
Is nowandevershallbe 
World without end 
Amen Amen Amen 
Amen 
The heavens declare the glory of the Bomb, and the firmament showeth His handiwork. 
His sun has gone out unto all the land. 
And gives light unto the end of the world. 
He descendeth from the outermost part of heaven, and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. 
There is neither speech nor language, yet His voice is heard among them. 
Praise Him. 
Praise Him. 
My strength and my redeemer. 
Glory be to the Bomb and to the holy fallout as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. 
Amen. Amen Amen 
Amen 
Almighty and everlasting Bomb, who came down among us to make heaven under Earth, 
Iighten our darkness. 
Instrument ofGod, grant us Thy peace. 
Almighty Bomb 
Who destroyed all heavens 
And created angels 
Behold His glory 
Behold the truth that abides in us. 
Reveal that truth unto that Maker. 
I reveal my inmost self unto my God. 
Unto my God. Unto my God 
All things bright and beautiful 
All creatures great and small 
All things wise and wonderful 
The good Bomb made us all 
He gave us eyes to see with 
And lips that we might tell 
How great the Bomb Almighty 
Who made all things well 
Let everyone go to his private shelter. 
Empty the streets. 
They're to find the city of the dead. 
May the blessing of the Bomb Almighty and the fellowship of the Holy Fall out descend on us this day and forever more. 
Amen 
I trust this simple ceremony convinced you of our peaceable intentions, and I'd like to thank you for your cooperation. 
When may we hope to be set free? 
You may hope whenever you please, Mr. Brent. 
How could we hope to let you go on the eve ofwar, Mr. Brent? 
You know too many of our secrets, 
like your friend. 
Taylor! 
You're Brent. 
My God, Taylor! 
Brent! How in the hell did you get here? 
Spaceship, ape city, subway.. 
By yourself? 
No, Nova found me. 
Nova? ls she with you? 
Where? 
I don't know. 
They separated us. 
They tried to make me kill her. 
Mr. Taylor, Mr. Brent, we're peaceful people. 
We don't kill our enemies. 
We get our enemies to kill each other. 
I'm fighting it. 
I'm fighting it off. 
Taylor. Taylor. Taylor. 
Taylor! 
Unto God... 
I reveal my inmost self. 
This isn't exactly sterile. 
We'll do the best we can. 
Taylor. 
Taylor, they've got a bomb.. 
Atomic bomb. 
It's operational. 
They intend to use it. 
What type is it? 
I don't know. 
I don't know what type. 
I've never seen it before. 
Didn't you see a series number? 
No numbers, just some letters on one of the fins, 
Greek letters. 
Alpha... 
And omega. 
What? 
The doomsday bomb. 
My God. 
Another lovely souvenir from the 20th Century. 
They weren't satisfied with a bomb that could knock out a city. 
They finally built one with a cobalt casing, all in the sweet name of peace. 
Those bloody fools. 
They don't know what they've got. 
They pray to the damn thing. 
If they shoot it off, it could set off a chain reaction in the whole atmosphere. 
Burn the planet to a cinder. 
How's that for your ultimate weapon? 
This must be what your scout reported, a subterranean passage. 
I think it's worth exploring. 
What will you do, Holiness? 
Everything necessary. 
Are you thinking what I'm thinking? 
I'm thinking just that. 
Nova. Nova. Nova. 
Ah, God! 
Should let them all die.. 
the gorillas, every damn... 
When it comes time. 
It's time it was finished. 
Finished. 
Taylor. 
Come on, come on. 
The bomb. 
Yeah. 
Why not? 
They're obscene! 
Follow me! 
Sergeant! 
Arrest that creature. 
This is the instrument of my God. 
He can speak. 
Your God, eh? 
Sergeant. 
Your God didn't save you, did he, huh? 
Ursus! 
That weapon is built by man. 
You can't shoot it down with bullets. 
If we can't shoot it down, we'll pull it down. 
Rope! 
Block and tackle! 
You don't know what you're doing. 
It will kill us all! 
I'll find a way to stop it. 
Men, over there! 
Ursus, someone at the pillar! 
Zaius. 
Taylor! 
It's dooms day. 
The end of the world. 
Help me. 
You ask me to help you! 
Man is evil, capable of nothing but destruction! 
You... bloody bastard. 
In one of the countless billions of galaxies in the universe 
lies a medium-sized star. 
And one of its satellites, a green and insignificant planet, now is dead. 
Come, come. 
Are you authorized to dress him like that? Oh, yes, sir. 
- A circus ape, huh? 
- The only one to have been trained as a bareback rider in the entire history of the circus. 
- Circuses are past history. 
- Not while I live and breathe. 
- All right, Señor Armando. Go ahead. 
- Thank you. 
Come, come. 
- Did I do all right? 
- Yes, yes, yes. 
But try to walk a little more like a primitive chimpanzee. 
Your arms should move up and down from the shoulder... 
Yes, that's better. 
After 20 years, you've picked up evolved habits from me. 
That could be dangerous. Even fatal. 
- Armando, I don't understand. 
- Listen to me, Caesar. 
There can be only one talking chimpanzee on Earth. 
The child of the two talking apes, Cornelius and Zira, who came to us years ago out of the future and were murdered for fear that one distant day apes might dominate the human race. 
Yeah, but outside of you, nobody even knows I exist. 
And we must keep it that way, for the fear remains. 
The mere fact of your existence would be regarded as a great threat to mankind. 
Come. Come.

But how did it happen? 
Go! 
Go! 
No! 
No! 
Go! 
You go! 
But you said humans treated apes like pets. 
- They did, in the beginning. 
- They've made slaves of them! 
They all died within a few months, eight years ago. 
Every dog and cat in the world. 
It was like a plague. 
The disease that killed them was a virus brought back from space by an astronaut. 
- Didn't the disease affect humans? 
- We were immune. 
And so, it was discovered, were simians, even the smallest ones. 
That's how it began. 
Humans wanting little household pets to replace the ones they had lost. 
Then, when people realized how quick they were to learn, how easy to train, the pets became larger, and larger, until now... 
It's monstrous. 
Now you understand why I've kept you away. 
Yes, Lisa. 
A Young Queen Falls for Mrs Riley. 
No! 
Lisa. 
Yes? 
Could you possibly be so kind as to display it in your window? 
- When I have the time. 
- Thank you. 
The labor demonstration on the South Plaza will be terminated in ten minutes. 
Repeat : the labor demonstration on the South Plaza will be terminated in ten minutes. 
Thank you, Frank. 
Funny. Now that I know they won't kill me, I don't enjoy them. 
Well, for heaven's sakes! A circus! 
Home, Lisa. 
- Yes? 
- Oh, I was wondering, would you be kind enough to display a couple of these posters? 
- Stop it! 
- No, Zelda! 
Home, Zelda. 
I'm so sorry, Mrs Riley. I'll have someone to comb you out in a minute. 
I wanna be combed out now. 
I have a luncheon. 
- Thursday, then. 
- Thursday. 
I... 
I forgot the waiter and I'm all out of raisins. 
- Take mine. 
- Thank you. 
You're overtipping. 
No! No! 
No! 
And I told them to condition him to fire. 
Attention. The labor demonstration on the South Plaza will be terminated in five minutes.

Failure to comply with this order can result in a one-year suspension of your right to bargain collectively. 
- What's his job? 
- He's a messenger. 
For the governor, so get! 
No! No! 
No! 
- Stop that at once! 
All of you! 
- Yes, sir, Mr MacDonald. We were just... 
I saw what you were doing. Now sedate the animal and get him out of here. 
- Who the hell's that? 
- The governor's number-one assistant. 
- He love apes or something? 
- Don't it figure? 
Hold him. 
Lousy human bastards! 
Who said that? 
I did. 
He's a performing ape for my circus. 
- A talking ape? 
- No! 
No, no. 
No, that's impossible. It was I who spoke. 
It didn't sound like your voice. 
Yell" Lousy human bastards." 
- That's not what I said. 
- That's what I heard. 
Now, look, mister, you yell" Lousy human bastards." 
- Lousy human bastards. 
- We said yell! 
Lousy human bastards! 
- Yeah, yeah. Could be. 
- I don't think so. 
- It's right. The ape spoke. 
- Yeah! 
No! 
No, they're mistaken. 
I admit my behavior was inexcusable and I am deeply sorry. 
I think we better take him to headquarters for interrogation. 
Guard! 
Move him on. 
- Armando, forgive me. 
- Oh, no, no. 
You only said aloud what I was thinking. 
I'm sorry. I was so angry. 
I might have bluffed it through if you hadn't run away. 
Now they suspect you of understanding all that was said. 
- Armando, let's go back to the circus. 
- No, no, no. 
- Oh, no, please. 
- No, that's the first place they'll look. 
Here's what we'll do. 
I'll go to the police. 
- Oh, no, no! 
- It's the only way! 
I'll say that... that I couldn't find you. 
That... you've run away before. 
- That big cities frighten you. 
- But, Armando, where would I go? 
You wait right here! 
If this works, I'll be back by nightfall. 
- But what if they don't let you go? 
- Oh, they will. They will. 
But just in case, if I am not back by then... 
Now, these steps go down to a tunnel that leads to the harbor. 
Cargoes of apes are frequently unloaded at night. 
- You must try to infiltrate one of them. 
- But, Armando... 
Apes imported from overseas arrive naked, so you'll have to get rid of these clothes. 
- Well, I don't want to. 
- We must have an alternate plan! 
Right now, the only safe hiding place for you is among your own kind. 
I shouldn't be long. 
Why would you say" human"? 
" Human." That's a very odd thing for another human being to say. 
I didn't say" human," Mr Governor. I said" inhuman." 
Lousy inhuman bastards. And by the blessed St Francis, who loved all animals, I meant it. 
- You see, I run a circus... 
- We know that. 
- From 20 years back. 
- Since the talking apes arrived on Earth and conceived a baby whose survival could have threatened the future of the human race. 
Mr Governor, I understand the baby was shot dead with its parents. 
Or so it was believed, Mr MacDonald. 
However, since this morning, I'm beginning to wonder if they shot the right baby. 
The apes could have switched their baby with one from the zoo. 
Or perhaps a circus. 
Surely, Mr Governor, you can't be serious! 
Hoskyns, the cassette, please. 
These are the recommendations made to the then president of the United States by the chairman of the Presidential Committee. 
And we believe that the male and female talking apes, Cornelius and Zira, have come to us out of the future. 
We believe their spoken testimony, that some 2,000 years hence, their descendants will have all but exterminated the human race from Earth. 
And we know that the female ape is now pregnant with child. 
The commission therefore recommends that the birth of the female ape's unborn child should be prevented and that both the male and the female should be rendered incapable of begetting another. 
But, Mr Governor, every zoo, public and private, was searched by the police, and every circus, including my own. 
- But a small chimpanzee was found. 
- The only one ever to be born in a circus, and legally certified to have been born a month - a month - before the talking apes arrived on earth. 
- Where is he now? 
- I wish I knew. I've searched everywhere. 
Señor Armando! 
Let me remind you... of the seriousness of our problem. 
Now. 
Your circus travels mainly in the provinces? 
Yes, sir. 
Then, undoubtedly, you are unaware of the rising tide of disobedience, the outright defiance, among the servant apes in our cities. 
Mr Governor, on investigation, many of the offenses have been proved minor. 
The ape killed while trying to escape from the city last night, 
- would you call his offense minor? 
- No, sir, I would not. 
He physically assaulted his own master. 
But only after what must have been severe provocation. 
The ape's body was covered with welts and bruises inflicted by a beating. 
Which he no doubt richly deserved. 
How many more of them out there are just like that ape? 
All burning with resentment. 
Waiting for an ape with enough intelligence, with enough will, to lead them. 
Waiting for an ape who can think. Who can talk. 
Señor Armando, has your ape ever talked or shown any signs of being articulate in your presence? 
Never in my presence, or anyone else's. 
You can question my circus hands. 
We intend to. 
Meanwhile, you will remain in custody. 
Shipment 507, I for Indonesia, ex-Borneo, now arriving at gate number two. 
Shipment 509, A for Africa, ex-French Cameroons, now arriving at number four gate. 
After fingerprinting, shipment 507, I for Indonesia, ex-Borneo, will proceed direct to conditioning cage 90. 
After fingerprinting, shipment 507, I for Indonesia, ex-Borneo, will proceed direct to conditioning cage 90. 
Immigration personnel are reminded that, until further notice, police have requested one additional copy of all chimpanzee fingerprints for their files. 
Repeat : immigration personnel are reminded that until further notice, police have requested one additional copy of all chimpanzee fingerprints for their files. 
Do! 
Next! 
No! 
They're a bit uppity. I haven't fed them yet. 
Come on! 
Switch off. 
Switch on. 
Have you seen this ape before? 
Isn't it... 
Cornelius? 
I thought you didn't know him? 
B-But you told me yourself. 
T-The talking ape that was murdered... 
- Executed. 
- Executed. 
- Would you say there's a resemblance? 
- Oh, no. 
Look very carefully. 
- Like father, like son, eh? 
You'd do well to cooperate with us. 
I-I... Could I... 
Could I please have a glass of water? 
Do. 
No! 
Do. 
No! 
No! 
Do. 
Attention. 
Training Control. 
Four females have arrived for insemination - three gorillas and one chimpanzee. 
Please select four superior males - three gorillas, one chimpanzee - and send them to the breeding annex immediately. 
254 process for auction. 
Yes, ma" am, for immediate sale. 
One male gorilla, age seven. Fully conditioned bedmaker, grade A. 
Yes, yes. You will be credited after auction. 
So you're a member of Breck's party. Now I understand how you got those big contracts. 
He's good for this country. Good for all of us. 
You really think he's gonna make it? 
I don't know of anyone who could stop him. 
Bring up lot eight! 
Lot eight! 
One male chimpanzee! 
In early prime and perfect physical condition. 
Take a good look at this specimen. 
This has to be the buy of the afternoon. 
Early prime. Perfect physical condition. 
Under observation, he appeared so familiar, obedient, docile and intelligent with humans that conditioning was not considered necessary. 
But it certainly can be provided on request. 
We're gonna start the bidding on this specimen at $ 800. 
All right, ladies and gentlemen, what am I bid on this superb specimen? 
Bidding starts at 800. 800. 
What am I bid for this superb specimen? 
800. 800. 
- 850! 
- 850 over here. Do I hear nine? 
- 900! 
- I hear nine over there! 
Nine over there! 
- 1, 000 from the gentleman on the end. $ 1, 000. - 950. 
- 950 over there on the end. 
- 1, 000. 
- 1 1 00! 
- 1 1 00 over here. 
- 1 1 50. 
- 1 1 50 in the back row. 
- 1 200 - $ 1 200 from this gentleman. 
Going to this gentleman. Going! 
Going... 
- Buy him. 
- 1 500! 
1 500 from Mr MacDonald! 
For His Excellency, Governor Breck. 
Going! 
Going! 
Gone! 
Come. 
It's very good, Morgan, but simplify the wording in that last paragraph. 
Sir, we've received a disappointing report on the automated sanitation plan. 
- You have a meeting with Curfew Control. 
- Cancel it, Miss Greer. 
These figures, did you double-check them? 
- Yes, sir. 
- Triple-check them! 
- Come. 
- Hold all calls, Miss Greer. 
Here's the IQ profile on all apes tested within the last four weeks. It's risen by 3 2 / 3 points. 
Uh-huh! Show Mr MacDonald. 
He thinks I'm imagining things. 
I assembled that. You summarized the wrong part. 
So their output has increased about the same percentage, which I thought the governor might regard as good news. 
It's all right. We'll go over that later. 
No. 
Watch. 
Do. 
No, no, no. Clean. 
Clean. It seems the little fella's not so bright after all. 
No. But brightness has never been encouraged amongst slaves. 
Oh, don't be so touchy, Mr MacDonald. 
All of us were slaves once, in one sense of the word or another. 
If you feel the ape's unsatisfactory, we can have him reconditioned. 
- That isn't necessary. 
- You're quite right, Mr MacDonald. 
But not for any of your bleeding-heart reasons. 
Reconditioning. That's all any of you ever think of, isn't it? 
Don't you realize, if we were to take every ape who disobeyed an order and sent him back for reconditioning, Ape Management would become overcrowded. 
- It's the only thing that has any effect. 
- Just makes them worse. 
Some of them couldn't be worse. I've been having a comprehensive list compiled. 
- Mr Governor. 
- Yes, what is it you want? 
It's your meeting with the Defense Council. 
I'll be along in a moment. 
- Defense Council? 
- I'll tell you about it later. 
Is this related to the list you mentioned? 
You'll be given full details, Mr MacDonald. 
Meanwhile, we're going to set a good example and recondition this fella ourselves. 
- We haven't named him yet, have we? 
- No, Mr Breck. 
I'm going to revive a charming tradition established in her lifetime by my dear wife, and let you name yourself. 
'Caesar.' A king. 
Yes? 
They're waiting for you in the council chamber. 
I don't think we'll ever make a bartender out of Caesar. 
Have him detailed to the Command Post. 
No! 
Attention. 
There is a report of unescorted apes in the Plaza. Investigate. 
Can I help you, Mr MacDonald? 
This ape's assigned to the Command Post. 
- What's his name, sir? 
- Caesar. 
Start him off in the files. 
Low-priority traffic. Yes, sir. 
Do! 
Lisa. Lisa! 
Ah! 
Señor Armando! - This way, señor. 
This way. - Sit down, sit down. 
We have good news for you. 
- Good news? 
- Yes. You're to be released. 
Inspector Hoskyns and I believe that your ape is not the child of the talking chimpanzees. 
- You found him? 
- Not yet, but he'll turn up sooner or later. 
I'm sorry for the inconvenience we had to cause you. 
Do forgive us, but it was unavoidable. 
Oh, yes. Yes. 
Then I'm... 
I'm free to go? 
Oh, as soon as you sign this sworn declaration. 
What does it say? 
Only what you've been telling us all along. 
The circus ape is incapable of human speech and, to the best of your knowledge, he's never uttered a word. 
Certainly. 
Excellent. Now we'll check this with the authenticator, then you'll be free to go. 
The... authenticator? 
It's just a formality. Sit back down, please. 
It'll just take a moment. 
What does the authenticator do? 
Makes people tell the truth. 
It's quite painless. 
For example, you said you first heard the name Cornelius in this office. Was that true? 
- No. 
- Now, there! 
You see? That's not a bad black mark against you. 
You probably heard it somewhere else before. 
Now. 
About your statement, sworn statement, that the circus ape is incapable of speech. 
- No. I won't submit to this. 
- You will, Señor Armando! 
I have done nothing wrong! 
You are treating me like a criminal! 
Sit back, please. 
No! 
No, no. 
- Guard! 
I knew that circus owner was lying. 
They insist he fell to his death accidentally. 
While trying to escape! 
He knew he'd been exposed. 
Attention. Attention. 
Last night, several security forces apprehended and placed in custody a number of servant apes from widely scattered households throughout the city, who had gathered clandestinely in the unused building on the outskirts of the East Sector. 
Property owners are firmly warned that they bear sole responsibility for the behavior and whereabouts of their servant apes. 
Frank! 
Frank. 
No! 
" One dozen steaks, New York cut, for Mrs Van Thal." 
Add one gallon of... 
No. Two gallons of kerosene. 
Mr Governor. The latest ape-disobedience figures. 
There's been a marked increase in property damage. 
Couldn't all be carelessness, Mr MacDonald! 
Arrange for distribution of the Achilles list. 
Copies to each police precinct. 
Details are to be left to the individual commanders, but I want every ape on that list delivered to the reconditioning center by 0600 tomorrow morning. 
I'm sorry, 309. The cages are full. 
We cannot accommodate any new intakes until after Tuesday's auction. 
" Collect one repaired Colt 45." 
And... 1 00 rounds ammunition. 
The Achilles list, Mr MacDonald, referring to our Achilles heel, contains the name of every ape who, over the past year, has been overtly disobedient. 
The charge against them is nonsense. 
It will do for my purposes. 
They constitute the hard core of our problem and I'm going to crush them once and for all! 
Sir, you will only further aggravate the problem. 
This action is folly, and I wish to protest it in the strongest possible terms. 
Very well, Mr MacDonald. 
Your protest has been duly noted. 
From now on, you have but one assignment : to find that talking ape. 
- What is this? A red alert? 
- Sort of. 
Ape Management computer's come up with an intriguing error. 
Shipment 507, I for Indonesia, comprised three orangutans and one chimpanzee. 
- So? - There are no chimpanzees in Borneo. 
Yes, sir. 
State Security Chief Inspector Kolp on line three. 
Yes, Inspector. 
Give me the Indonesia file for last month. 
That's 507, ex-Borneo. 
Right, Inspector. 
Let me check. 507, ex-Borneo. Yes, sir. 
That chimpanzee was sold to Governor Breck. 
Good God! Just as I first thought. 
We've had him under our noses all the time! 
Sir, I'm willing to have the ape executed immediately on your verbal orders alone. 
- You'll have it in writing. 
- Thank you, sir. Get Mr MacDonald at the Command Post. 
However, suppose he can speak but won't? 
I don't understand. 
The chief inspector means there'd still be a doubt. 
If the chimpanzee keeps his mouth shut, the case stays open. We'd like to close the file. 
You shall. I promise you. 
Reconditioning applications have to be made out in triplicate. 
MacDonald speaking. Yes, sir. 
You want me to turn Caesar over to Inspector Kolp? 
Is he on your Achilles list? 
Mr MacDonald, do not question an order. 
No, sir, I'm not questioning the order. 
It's just that... Well, I sent him out on an errand. 
He should be back momentarily. 
Yes, sir. I'll do just as you say. 
Come. 
- No, this goes to Traffic Control! 
- Take it easy. They can't read. 
Not yet, they can't. 
Do. 
Mr MacDonald, are you near a phone? 
Mr MacDonald, it is imperative that you get to a phone! 
Come in, Mr MacDonald! 
Do you hear me? 
Get to a phone and come in! 
- Yes, Mr Governor. 
- Kolp is on his way down with the police. 
- Is Caesar back yet? 
- Not yet, sir. I'll keep a look out. 
Notify me the moment he's handed over to them. 
Yes, sir. 
I wish... 
I wish there was some way we could communicate, so you'd understand that I... 
I understand, 
Mr MacDonald. 
Yes, I... 
I'm the one they're looking for. 
I never believed it. 
I... 
I thought you were a myth. 
Well, I'm not. 
But I will tell you something that is. 
The belief that human beings are kind... 
No, Caesar. 
There are some... A handful, perhaps, but not most of them. 
They won't learn to be kind until we force them to. 
We can't do that until we are free. 
How do you propose to gain this freedom? 
By the only means left to us. 
- Revolution. 
- But... it's doomed to failure! 
Perhaps... this time. 
- And the next. 
- Maybe. - You, above everyone else, should understand. - But you'll keep trying. 
We cannot be free until we have power. 
How else can we achieve it? 
Go. 
Ah, Mr MacDonald, I have an order from the governor to take Caesar into custody. 
I know. I've been looking for him. 
- He's not in the Command Post? 
- No. Issue an order to round up all unaccompanied apes. 
I still don't see why he made a run for it. 
It's really quite simple, Mr MacDonald. 
The ape has intelligence. 
He knew that his friend Armando was dead. 
He assumed the man first betrayed him under torture. 
But we don't do that... to humans. 
Now. 
Talk! 
Have... 
Ha... Have pity. 
That's incredible! 
Well, there's your proof! 
We're convinced, Mr Governor. 
It's fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. Have him say something else. 
You heard the governor. 
Answer! 
- We could persuade him. 
- No. He's not responsible for what he is. 
Still, seeing him there, it's like looking at some deadly bacillus and... knowing you've got it bottled up at last. 
- Is that all, sir? 
- Not quite. 
I have an authorization here from the governor to have this beast destroyed. 
I'll notify the vet to inject him. 
- He is wired for electrocution, isn't he? 
- Oh, yes. Well, then, electrocute him. Now. 
- He's dead. 
- Good. 
- Good work, Inspector. 
- What happened to Mr MacDonald? 
I'm afraid his sensibility... 
Ah, there you are! 
- Is it over? 
- Yes, it's over. 
Shall we go back to work? 
Lisa. 
All keepers and handlers, attention. 
Attention! All keepers and handlers. 
There is $ 50,000 worth of apes in jeopardy. 
Get them out of here... alive! 
Yes. Commander, I understand the situation. 
Assemble as large a force as you can and follow them. 
Mobilize all security forces, police, militia and reserve defense units. 
See that every entrance into the city is cordoned off. 
Will control methods include tear gas and sedation darts? 
There will be but one control method : shoot to kill. 
A small group of apes, scheduled for intensive reconditioning, have escaped from Ape Management. 
Until they've been rounded up by the police, all citizens are requested to remain indoors. 
A further announcement will be made as soon as recapture is effected. 
And, I guess, here it is. 
Ape Management is in the hands of the apes. 
Many officials are either dead or held hostage. 
The main band of rioting apes are at this very moment marching on the city. 
It's been established that the ape mob is under the command of a supernormally intelligent chimpanzee who has... acquired the power of speech. 
That idiot! Get out a retraction immediately! 
Announce that the talking ape has been put to death! 
.. the child of the two talking chimpanzees, Cornelius and Zira, who came to us from outer space 20 years ago. 
As such, he constitutes a threat to the future of the whole human race. 
Governor Breck has just issued this order to all civilians : 
go to your homes. 
Stay in your home and lock your doors. 
Above all, do not panic. 
Repeat : go to your homes. 
Stay in your homes and lock your doors. 
The situation can be kept under control provided our defense forces are given complete freedom of movement. 
No! 
Go back! 
No! 
No! 
Go home! 
Back! 
Ready. 
Aim. 
Fire! 
Ready. 
Aim. 
Fire! 
Yes. 
Yes. 
Understood. Riot Control say the apes have broken through the cordon. 
Advance units are approaching the Plaza. 
Order units four and six into action immediately. 
No! 
They've reached the Plaza. 
- Good God! They're armed! 
- And organized. 
- No! 
Home! - Don't plead with them, you idiot! 
Ready! 
No! 
Home! 
Aim! 
Fire! 
What's the trouble down there? 
My God! 
There's more! 
- They're inside the building. 
- Alert all security posts! 
- Right, sir. 
- No! No! 
The circuits are dead. 
Take a message. To Riot Control, urgent. 
Command Post under attack! Repeat : 
Command Post under attack! 
It won't work, sir. 
No! 
But how? How? 
They don't have the intelligence to use such tools! 
Give me your gun! 
This is the Communication Center. 
We have no defense. 
If we lose this battle, that's the end of the world as we know it! 
We will have proved ourselves inferior. Weak! 
And all the groveling cowards left alive when the battle is over will be the weakest of all! 
This will be the end of human civilization and the world will belong to a planet of apes! 
No! 
No, go. Go! 
Caesar! 
Your servant. 
Your creature. Your animal! 
But I saw you die. 
The king is dead. 
Long live the king! 
Tell me, Breck, before you die, how do we differ from the dogs and cats you and your kind used to love? 
Why did you turn us from pets into slaves? 
Because your kind were once our ancestors. 
Man was born of the ape. 
And there's still an ape curled up inside of every man. 
The beast that must be whipped into submission. 
The savage that has to be shackled in chains. 
You are that beast, Caesar. You taint us. 
You poison our guts! 
When... 
When we hate you, we're... we're hating the dark side of ourselves. 
Take him. 
Go! 
Caesar. This is not how it was to be. 
In your view or mine? 
Violence prolongs hate. 
Hate prolongs violence. 
By what right are you spilling blood? 
By the slave's right to punish his persecutors. 
Caesar. I, a descendant of slaves, am asking you to show humanity. 
But I was not born human. 
I know. The child of the evolved apes. 
Whose children shall rule the Earth. 
For better or for worse? 
Do you think it could be worse? 
Do you think this riot will win freedom for all your kind? 
- By tomorrow... 
- By tomorrow, it will be too late. 
A tiny, mindless insect like the emperor moth can communicate with another 
- over a distance of 80 miles. 
- An emperor ape might do slightly better? 
Slightly? 
What you have seen here today, apes on the five continents will be imitating tomorrow. 
With knives against guns? With kerosene cans against flame-throwers? 
Where there is fire, there is smoke. 
And, in that smoke, from this day forward, my people will crouch and conspire and plot and plan for the inevitable day of man's downfall. 
The day when he finally and self-destructively turns his weapons against his own kind. 
The day of the writing in the sky, when your cities lie buried under radioactive rubble. 
When the sea is a dead sea and the land is a wasteland out of which I will lead my people from their captivity. 
And we shall build our own cities in which there will be no place for humans, except to serve our ends. 
And we shall found our own armies, our own religion, our own dynasty! 
And that day is upon you... now! 
" ln the beginning, God created beast and man so that both might live in friendship and share dominion over a world of peace." 
" But in the fullness oftime, evil men betrayed God's trust, and in disobedience to His holy word waged bloody wars, not only against their own kind, but against the apes, whom they reduced to slavery." 
" Then God in His wrath sent the world a savior, miraculously born oftwo apes, who descended on Earth from Earth's own future." 
" And man was afraid, for both parent apes possessed the power of speech." 
Come on. 
" So both were brutally murdered." 
" But the child ape survived, and grew up to set his fellow creatures free from the yoke of human slavery." 
No. 
" Yet, in the aftermath ofthis victory, the surface ofthe world was ravaged by the vilest war in human history." 
" The great cities ofthe world split asunder and were flattened, and out of one such city our savior led a remnant ofthose who survived in search of greener pastures, where ape and human might forever live in friendship, 
according to divine will." 
" His name was Caesar, and this is his story in those far-off days." 
- You're not gonna make it, Jake. 
- We'll make it. 
I'll show you how. 
- Thanks, Aldo. 
- You will call me by my proper rank. 
General. 
Yes, General. 
Don't put him in the corral. I won't be long. 
" Ape shall never kill ape." 
" Ape shall never kill ape." 
Shall ape ever kill man? 
You're late, General Aldo. 
Come and read this to the class. 
- l won't. 
- You won't because you can't. 
And you can't because you don't want to learn. 
And it is my duty to report this to Caesar. 
If my father were a gorilla, we'd all be learning riding instead ofwriting. 
Silence. 
Silence. 
Cornelius... 
Remember - you are Caesar's son and heir. 
Being a good rider isn't enough for being a good ruler. 
Though, in human history, quite a number of military dictators seem to have thought so. 
Now, all ofyou, take your charcoal sticks and parchments and copy down what I've written. 
The best shall be hung from these hooks. 
I can think of better things to hang from those hooks. 
- But, Virgil, can we tamper with time? 
- Accept my premise. 
- What premise? 
- Man learned to travel faster than sound. 
He could have learned to travel faster than light. 
- We accept. 
- Then imagine a musician giving a live broadcast from London to New York on a Wednesday. 
He then travels faster than light from London to New York, where he arrives, as physicists would confirm, on the previous Tuesday. 
Listens to his own broadcast on the Wednesday, dislikes its quality, then travels faster than light to London, in time for him to decide not to give his broadcast. 
Come. I'll prove it to you logically. 
Good, Cornelius. 
But you've made a mistake here. 
You have put a b in place ofthe second p. 
Teacher, have you forgotten your own name? 
Everyone has always called me" Teacher" - l had forgotten." Ape shall never kill Abe." 
Thank you, Cornelius. 
That was a very kind thought. 
Gorillas? 
All right, Aldo, let's start with you. 
General Aldo. 
With respect, General Aldo, this is barely legible and will have to be written again. 
Your capital A leans over like a tent in a high wind. 
And your capital K... 
" Ape shall never kill Abe." 
No, Aldo, no. 
Teacher! 
Teacher. 
You have spoken the unspeakable. 
In all our years of slavery," no" was the one word we were conditioned to fear. 
Caesar has forbidden you its utterance in perpetuity. 
An ape may say no to a human, but a human may never again say no to an ape. 
Tell him you're sorry, Abe, and go home. 
I'll put in a good word for you with Caesar. 
General Aldo, I'm... 
I'm sorry. The writing you destroyed was by Caesar's son. 
- l did not want you to suffer Caesar's anger. 
- What do I care for Caesar's anger? 
Let me give you a taste of mine. 
Stop him. 
Get him. Get the teacher. 
Stop! 
Stop. 
We'll teach the teacher a lesson. 
Throw him in the corral, where all humans belong. 
I said stop, Aldo. 
He broke the law. With his own mouth, he broke the First Law. 
- l am the law. What has he done? 
- Caesar. 
I... I was there. 
He... he spoke like a slavemaster in the old days of our servitude, when we were conditioned to mechanical obedience. 
He uttered a negative imperative. 
Could you put that into words which even Caesar could understand? 
He said" No, Aldo, no." 
- The schoolroom was wrecked. 
- The class is ended. 
The schoolroom is closed. 
Now we go back to riding horses. 
Aldo! 
You and your friends will return to the schoolroom and put it back in order. 
Abe, no gorilla is to be dismissed until everything is back in its place. 
- Yes, Caesar. 
- Father? 
Since there won't be any more school today, may I go out and play? 
- Well, can't you study in the house? 
- l could, Father, but... 
Run along and play. 
Where are my students? 
I was in the midst of explaining my theory oftime relativity. 
- lf Caesar permits, I would like to... 
- Caesar permits. 
- You look concerned, MacDonald. 
- l am, Caesar. 
I think that Aldo's hatred is not confined to humans. 
Look out! 
I think Aldo may be riding for a fall. 
If only my mother and father, whom I was too young to remember, if only they'd lived. 
Perhaps they would have taught me if it was right to kill evil so that good should prevail. 
But you know, Caesar, history shows... 
Now that is human history, not ape history. 
Ape never kills ape. 
Here's the list of our winter supplies so far. 
Well, I've gotta be getting along. 
I'm starving. I could eat a horse. 
- A horse? 
- You remember Lisa. 
They used to eat lots ofthings. Dead cattle, dead chickens, dead pigs. 
Now we live and chew nuts at our masters' command. 
- That will be all, Julie. 
- Thank you. 
We are not your masters. 
We're not your equals. 
MacDonald, I believe that when you truly grow to know and trust a person, you cannot help but like him. 
When we grow to know and trust your people, then we shall all be equals - and remain so until the end ofthe world. 
- Which may be sooner than you think. 
- You are such a pessimist. 
- Or a prophet? 
- Well, now that apes are at the helm, 
Earth will sail safely through space until the end oftime. 
And Virgil says" Time has no end." 
So you see, I cannot believe you. 
Would you believe it ifyou heard it from the lips ofyour own parents? 
- Are my parents alive? 
- No. 
But their images and their voices are. 
MacDonald. When you talk about my parents, please do not speak in riddles. 
I cannot see or hear them. They came out of the future. They cannot give me knowledge. 
Caesar... 
You can see them. 
You can hear them. 
- And they can give you knowledge. 
- How? 
Under the dead city where we once lived, in the archives near the old command post, there are tapes - sealed tapes - of Cornelius and Zira being examined by officials ofthe American government. 
When my brother was Governor Breck's assistant, he told me about them. 
I know where they are. And I know that they concern Earth's future, from which your parents came. 
But the city was flattened. 
The bomb left nothing. 
Except, I suspect, the archives section - indeed, many sections ofthe underground city were designed to survive the impact of a ten-megaton overblast. 
- Then the tapes and pictures of my parents... 
- Are still down there. 
MacDonald... I want to see what they look like. 
I... I suppose every orphan does. 
I want to hear what they thought and knew. 
The city's radioactive. 
Yeah, well... 
Let me see, who... 
who is there among your people who knows something about radioactivity? 
- No one. 
- Among mine? 
Who knows everything about everything? 
Virgil. 
Go and find him. 
Lisa, you remember your parents. 
I was too young when they died to remember mine. 
But I don't want to have to remember my husband. I want to love him now. 
Look, Virgil will be with us. 
Now, we'll take good care. 
Say goodbye to Cornelius. 
I don't want him to know I'm afraid. 
Cornelius? 
Cornelius. 
Father. 
- l'm going on ajourney. 
- What will you bring me back? 
What would you like? 
More nuts for my squirrel. He's growing fast. 
So are you. 
One day you will be as tall as a king. 
Mandemus? 
- He's asleep. 
- Not eternally, I trust? 
Mandemus. 
- Who's there? 
- Caesar. 
- What does Caesar want? 
- Weapons. 
- For what purpose? 
- Self-protection in the pursuit of knowledge. 
- Self-protection against whom or what? 
- We don't know. 
Why protect yourself against a danger of which you have no knowledge, in pursuit of a knowledge you do not possess? 
Oh, God! 
- ls it a knowledge for good or evil? 
- All knowledge is for good. 
Only the use to which you put it can be good or evil. 
- Well put. 
- Thank you. 
The sun is rising. I should like to get this matter settled before it sets. 
Caesar has appointed me not only as the keeper ofthis armory, but as the keeper of his own conscience. 
That is why I have asked six boring questions, and propose to ask a seventh before issuing or not issuing the weapons you require. 
What is the nature ofthe knowledge you cannot seek without weapons? 
The knowledge of Earth's ultimate fate, recorded on tapes in the forbidden city. 
Which is contaminated, but still may be inhabited by humans. 
Come in. 
- Name your protective pick. 
- Three submachine-guns. 
- For? 
- The removal of obstacles. 
One... 
Two... 
- And three. Now what? 
- Ammunition. 
I really don't hold with knowing the future - even my own, which is short. 
A Geiger counter. 
If we knew for a fact there was an afterlife, and that the afterlife was bliss eternal, we'd all commit suicide in order to be able to enjoy it. 
Pistols. 
- To remove smaller obstacles? 
- lt's a three-dayjourney. 
With Caesar's permission, MacDonald may want to shoot, cook and eat a rabbit. 
But who needs three pistols to shoot one rabbit? 
- Enjoy your meal. 
- Thank you. 
He may be old, but he's got a mind like a razor. 
When I was a boy, he was my teacher. 
Let's collect our stores and be on our way, huh? 
There it is - or was. 
Like a storm at sea, but solidified. 
By a bomb from an armory 1,000 times the size of ours. 
And nobody to keep its owner's conscience. 
This is the hell my forefathers used to speak about. 
Do you know where we are, MacDonald? 
Yes. Now, this is... 
I mean was, 11th Avenue. 
Ape Management was two blocks east from here. 
The archive section, two blocks west - corner of Breck and Ackerman. 
Get us there quickly. 
The Governor's very irritable lately. 
Who wouldn't be, living in this hell of radiation all these years? 
If the bomb hadn't killed the old governor, boredom certainly would have. 
Alma, I just want somebody to talk to. Anybody. 
We are at best brave and at worst mad to be here. 
This background radiation alone will give us 300 roentgens per hour. 
Meaning? 
That unless we leave this place within two hours, we shall become inmates. 
This is a ghost city. 
I want to put some flesh on it. 
Radioactive flesh? 
Well, we're all radiated, but at least we're active. 
Getting stronger. We must hurry. 
Governor, look. 
- F6. 
F6. - What now? 
Alert Mendez. 
Men... 
Mendez to Control Room. 
Mendez to Control Room. 
Mendez to ControlRoom. 
Somebody's breached the warning system at F6. 
- One of our scavengers. 
- No. lt's been locked for years. 
- lt must have been someone else. 
- lmpossible. There is no one else. 
Mendez, we have to act, and act quickly. 
- Alma? 
- Yes, sir? 
Work the B console. 
Quick, Mendez, quick. Quick. 
No, quicker. Faster. 
Keep going... 
No, no. Back. Back. 
This is the place. 
That's Caesar, come back to reconquer his kingdom. 
Doesn't he know that the bomb did that? 
We're still all right. 
This way. 
Quicker. Quicker. 
There. Hold it. 
Can anything live down here? 
I mean, for long? 
Yes. But in the end, not recognizably. 
The black man is the brother of my predecessor's personal assistant. 
He supervised the archives. 
I don't think I know the orangutan. 
- Look. 
- lt's been there for years. 
The late governor had this whole place equipped with cameras. 
To forestall ape conspiracies, as I remember. 
We haven't been in there since... I wonder what the devil they want in there. 
We'll find the tape we're looking for under the heading of" Presidential Commission." 
" Proceedings ofthe Presidential Commission on Alien Visitors, 1973." 
- ls this it? 
- Let's see. 
Yes, that's it. 
Now, ifthis thing works, the picture should come out on that screen over there. 
All security forces, alert. 
All security forces, alert. 
Check outallsections in areas M5. 
Apprehend three strangers you will find there. 
One human and two apes. 
But caution. lrepeat, caution. 
If they resist, you may shoot. 
But shoot to maim. 
We want them alive for interrogation. 
If we shoot, we break 12 years of peace. 
Yes, it has been rather boring, hasn't it? 
My mother. 
- Who won your war? 
- lt wasn't our war. lt was the gorillas' war. 
The date meter on the spaceship. What diditreadafterEarth's destruction? 
3950. 
And you talk to your pupils about eternity. 
There are only three. 
There must be more. But how many? 
That's the question we'll have answered when we get them. 
My father. 
That's my father. 
- How didapes acquire the power ofspeech? 
- Theylearned to refuse. 
On a historic day, there came an ape who spoke a word which hadbeen spoken to him time withoutnumberbyhumans. 
He said" No." 
No wonder all mankind thirsted for my blood and wanted my birth aborted. 
In the year 3950, apes will destroy the Earth. 
Not apes. Gorillas. 
- Besides, that's only one future. 
- How can there be more than one? 
You remember the old motorways? 
I believe that time is like an endless motorway, with an infinite number of lanes all running from the past into the future. 
It follows that a driver would try to change his lanes and change his future. 
If you left this room right now, you might wind up shot. Dead. 
If you left a minute later, you might survive. 
It's a blind choice, but you can change lanes. 
I know what it is I want to change. 
The camera. lt moved. 
Are you sure? 
Virgil's right. 
Governor? We just lost the TV monitor. Our 8-41 archive. 
- l'm not interested in equipment failures. 
- lt wasn't a failure. lt was destroyed. 
- We have to find another way out. 
- ls there another way? 
They gotpastyou? 
Then shoot on sight. 
Never mindaboutbringing them here. 
Just get them. Don't let anyone escape alive. 
Sections M5 and R7 and 8. 
Form a group here. Quick, quick. All right, move out. 
Move! 
Move! 
Hurry! 
Run! 
Run! 
Now you've got your guns, we need another patrol quickly. 
Quickly, men. Hurry. Hurry. 
The rest ofyou, take your weapons and go to M5. 
Go. Go. What are you waiting for? 
To R8. 
All forces into exit level 3. 
They're getting away. Kill them. 
Kill them. Kill them! 
You knew every bolt and nut in those corridors. 
You have a hundred armed men. 
How could you let them escape? 
They were fast and smart, Governor Kolp. 
Many of my men were sick. 
And the chimp surprised us. 
Yeah... 
He surprised me too, once. 
But he's an animal. He's only an animal. 
No, Governor, he's more than an animal. He can speak. 
- So can they all. 
- So speech makes them human? 
Speech makes them intelligent. 
And intelligence may make them not human, but humane. 
- Perhaps they came in peace. 
- Idiot. They were armed. 
From what we saw on the monitor, only for self-protection. Let them return in peace. 
- To where? 
- To wherever they live. 
So that they can come back and exterminate those of us the bomb has not exterminated? 
- Where do they live? 
- They came with few provisions. 
- lt can't be too far. 
- Which way did they head? 
- They headed north, Governor. 
- Organize scout parties. 
Assemble workable equipment and follow them to their camp. 
Yes, Governor Kolp. 
Why, Governor? 
So that we can exterminate them. 
- lt's Caesar. 
- What a welcome. 
- We should have stayed in the city. 
- The city is forbidden. 
- l know. I forbade it. 
- Then why? 
If a king forbids his subjects to wear a crown, that doesn't mean he can't wear one himself. 
Caesar is Caesar. 
He went to the city for a reason. 
What reason? 
I went looking for my past. 
But I found our future. 
Explain. 
- You wouldn't understand. 
- Aldo will make the future. With this. 
Well then, Aldo may very soon be in the past. 
Cornelius. 
Cornelius, are you all right? 
- No, Mother. I'm just dead. 
- Dead? 
- We were playing war. 
- War? 
Cornelius, hasn't your father explained to you that war is not a game? 
- Yes, Mother. 
- And also forbidden you to play with guns? 
- Yes, Mother. 
- Then you'll stop it. 
- Yes, Mother. 
- Now come along. Father wants us. 
My friends, I have convened this extraordinary meeting ofthe council in order that I may report upon an action which I deemed necessary : 
a reconnaissance expedition to the forbidden city, with Virgil and MacDonald as my aides. 
Why MacDonald? 
Why not a soldier? 
Because we went in peace to what we thought would be a dead city. 
But, in case there were some survivors, we took MacDonald with us so that he could parley with them and secure permission for our search. 
Survivors there are... 
Maimed, mutated, hostile and human. 
- Did the humans follow you here? 
- We saw no sign of it. 
But we must prepare for the day when they may come out ofthe city, when they may come to find us. 
No humans in council. 
No humans in council. 
No. No. No. 
Yes! 
They are here because I sent for them. 
Now that we know the danger, we need their help and counsel. 
No. No. 
- Yes. 
- Come. 
We shall not sit in council with humans. 
Now, let us reason together and make plans. 
Somewhere along the line of history, this bloody chain reaction has got to stop. 
A destroys B, B destroys C, C destroys A and is destroyed by D, who destroys E. 
Before anyone knows where they are, there won't be anyone left to know anything. 
Governor. 
Governor, the captain has come back. 
- We found it, Governor. We found Ape City. 
- Where? 
This... 
This is a gorilla outpost. 
Below is a valley with orchards and vineyards - enough to feed hundreds. 
- Here is Ape City. 
- Was it very large? 
- lt is of a size we can deal with. 
- Were you seen? 
No, sir. Caesar was busy with a council of war. One day soon they'll be coming for us. 
No, we're going after them - now. 
You have your orders. 
Caesar... 
On the Night ofthe Fires you swore an oath that in the future, apes and humans would live together in kindness and peace. 
Why are you now making every sort of preparation to break that oath? 
Because, unlike the humans in our city, those in the forbidden city are mad. 
Mad enough not to want peace and friendship, but enmity and war. 
- Did they tell you that? 
- Yes. 
Yes. By opening fire on us without giving us a chance to explain. 
You were trespassing on their territory. 
But Lisa, we didn't know the city was inhabited. 
But how, ifyou didn't speak to them, do you know its inhabitants are mad? 
Lisa, you didn't see them. 
They're... 
They're malformed. 
Like the freaks in your foster father's circus? 
Were they mad? 
What's" malformed"? 
Cornelius, go to bed. 
When I've given Ricky his water. 
Lisa, freaks are different. 
These humans are the end product of nuclear radiation. 
They're mutant, and they're mad. 
- Keep all emergency channels open. 
- Yes, Governor. 
All emergency channels will remain open. 
If anything should miscarry, I'll signal you as arranged. 
Yes, sir. 
Hurry, man. We need it. 
The school bus will be operational, Governor. 
The convoy will join us atjunction C. 
Get moving. 
Ricky? 
Without guns, we have no power. 
We shall take the guns, and we shall keep them. 
They equal power. 
Guns. Guns are power. 
We are an elite. We are a superrace. 
We have the right to lead. 
Without us, there would be no army. 
What is an army without guns? 
We need power. 
We deserve it. We deserve to have power. 
We need power. 
Guns. Guns. 
Guns are power. 
We shall get them, and we shall keep them. 
With guns, we will smash the humans. 
All humans. 
And then, we will smash Caesar. 
Look. 
- lt's Caesar's son. 
- And he overheard every word we said. 
Cornelius... 
Come down. 
Come down, or else. 
Father... 
Cornelius? 
Father! 
Cornelius! 
I only heard about it this morning. His squirrel is missing. 
- He must have been out looking for it. 
- How is Cornelius? 
Hurt. He's badly hurt. 
Speak the truth. 
Even ifwe had a hospital... I'm not going to tell Caesar. 
Not yet. 
He still believes he can change the future. 
Humans - going towards our city. 
I'll get him. 
Get ready to fire. 
Fire. 
The doctor is doing her best. 
I don't believe Cornelius can live. 
Caesar does. He... 
he refuses to leave his side. 
How can a benevolent God allow the branch of one of His own trees to crack and injure an innocent child? 
It didn't crack, Virgil. lt was cut. 
Order at council. Order. 
Order. The humans are attacking. 
They have killed one gorilla, and they have wounded another. 
Tell them. 
We were scouting desert approaches to the city and saw their army. 
They fired. My companion was killed. 
- l have come to warn you. 
- And how long before they get here? 
Soon. So now we must prepare. 
Take the humans out. Lock them all in the corral. 
Aldo. Aldo, you can't do this. 
You're acting against Caesar's orders. 
Caesar is not here. 
Hey. What the...? 
Jake... 
Strong man. 
Take him to the corral. 
Take all humans to the corral. 
Take all humans to the corral. 
All humans. Take them to the corral. 
Where are you going? 
Martial law has been declared. 
- Everybody is to stay in their homes. 
- By whose orders? 
Go home. 
We want guns. 
Guns are power. 
Now we go and get guns. 
- Mandemus. 
- Who's there? 
Aldo. General Aldo. 
- What do you want? 
- Guns. 
- Guns. 
- What will you do with them? 
- We shall do with them what we will. 
-" Do what you will" is the Devil's law. 
- And who are you, Mandemus? 
God? 
- l am the keeper of Caesar's conscience. 
- And I am the keeper of Caesar's army. 
- Under allegiance to Caesar. Where is he? 
Mandemus, as I speak, our city is being attacked by humans from without and within. 
- Who cares where Caesar is? 
- l care. 
There is a law that weapons may only be issued under direct orders from Caesar, not under threats from a thick-headed subordinate, for whom war means only personal glory. 
Now find me Caesar. I will listen to him. 
First, listen to this. 
Take every gun in the place. Everything. 
Get the ammo boxes. 
Get the handguns, grenades. 
Stop. 
Stop! 
Caesar forbids you. 
Well, there it is. Ape City. 
When we leave, I don't want to see one tree left standing, two pieces ofwood nailed together, or anything left alive. 
I want it to look like that city we came from. 
What the devil is all that rubbish down there? 
Some sort of barricade, sir. Nothing that a couple offlame bombs won't take care of. 
Caesar, forgive me, but I couldn't get here before now. Aldo has seized power. 
He's broken into the armory and imprisoned all humans. 
- MacDonald? 
- He was dragged away by Aldo's gorillas. 
I can't leave Cornelius. 
He needs me. 
Every ape and human in Ape City needs you. 
Now. 
I... 
I think you should go to Cornelius. 
Father? 
They hurt me. 
They want to hurt you. 
Who hurt you? 
The humans? 
No... 
Then who? 
Shall... 
Shall I be malformed? 
No. 
One day you are going to be as tall as a king. 
Captain, lay the smoke screen, and when I give the signal, start the bombardment. 
Men and equipment out ofthe bus. 
Deploy your weapons, quickly. 
- All is in order, sir. 
- All right, let's go. 
He said they hurt him. Who? 
Who would hurt him? 
I think you'll have your answer - and soon. 
What do you know? 
That's what I know. 
- You did this. 
- For security. 
Did you raid the armory for the same reason? 
- For security. 
- Caesar. 
I order you to stop this. I order you to stop it now and release those people. 
See? 
Aldo was right. 
War has come. Let's go. 
Go to the barricade. To the barricade. 
Come on. Go to the barricade. 
They're laying a smoke screen. 
Here they come. 
- Where's Aldo? 
- Probably the other side ofthe valley. 
Hurry! 
Fall back! 
Fall back! 
Fall back. 
Go back to the village. 
Get away from the fire. 
Fall back. 
Hurry! 
Flee the barricade. 
Fall back! 
Fall back! 
Get back to the village. 
You can't stay here any longer. 
You must save yourself. 
Caesar. 
Your people weakened our city by rebelling against your human masters. 
But we who survive will create a new race. 
And you and yours will be brought low. 
And you shall learn again what it is to have a master. 
You're learning already. 
Clever ape. 
Oh, no. 
Ape. 
Clever ape. 
But then you always were clever. 
I was told how you chose your own name. 
But every Caesar must have his Brutus. 
Did you know that, ape? 
Do you understand that, ape? 
And now Ape City is about to lose its king. 
No, Kolp! 
No! 
Now. Fight like apes. 
No. Stop. No killing. 
Take them captive. 
Let's get moving. 
No. No, no, no. Don't kill them. 
Take them prisoner. 
No. 
No, Virgil. 
All right, Virgil. 
Let's go home. 
No prisoners. No prisoners. 
Dismount. 
Caesar! 
Caesar! 
Hail, Caesar! 
Let the humans go, Virgil. All ofthem. 
No. 
- They stay. Aldo says what we do now. 
- They have done nothing. They shall go free. 
You like humans? 
You want them out ofthe corral? 
All right. Kill them. 
Kill them. 
Kill them all. 
Stop. Stop! 
No more killing, Aldo. 
Put down your weapons. 
- Take them back to the armory. 
- No. We shall keep the guns. 
Move, Caesar, or we shall kill you. 
Ape has never killed ape, let alone an ape child. 
Aldo has killed an ape child. 
The branch did not break. 
It was cut, with a sword. 
Aldo... 
You... 
You killed... 
Aldo killed. 
Aldo has broken our most sacred law. 
Our child... 
You killed our child. 
What's the matter with them? 
I guess you might say they justjoined the human race. 
Ape has killed ape. 
Ape has killed ape. 
You murdered my son. 
You murdered my son. 
No. 
Should one murder be avenged by another? 
Only the future can tell. 
So let us start building it. 
If we appear to be lacking in gratitude, Caesar, what have we to be grateful for? 
If you mean to set us free, then free us completely. 
- What do you mean? 
- We are not your children, Caesar. 
We have a destiny too. As equals. 
Respecting each other. 
Living together, with love. 
Love? 
The human way is violence and death. 
Aldo wasn't human, was he, Caesar? 
Virgil... 
You are a good and wise ape. 
And you, Caesar, are a good and wise king. 
We'll rebuild what's ruined and begin again. 
Tell me something, MacDonald. Can we make the future what we wish? 
I've heard that it's possible, Caesar. 
There. Every weapon is back in its proper place. 
Caesar, I want to ask a favor. 
This armory's been my home for 27 years. 
You may live in it for the rest ofyour days. 
But I don't want to live in it. No, no. 
Now that the danger is over, I want to see it destroyed, blown up. 
The greatest danger of all is that danger never ends. 
And so, Mandemus, we must be patient and wait. 
We still wait, my children. 
But as I look at apes and humans living in friendship, harmony and at peace 
now, some 600 years after Caesar's death, at least we wait with hope for the future. 
Lawgiver, who knows about the future? 
Perhaps only the dead.

They found us again. 
Another one has found us. 
We have to go further. 
Not yet. 
- Mr. Crockett? 
- Yes. 
My name is Mears. Ben Mears. 
I'm looking for a place to rent. 
For how long? 
Six months maybe. 
Family? 
No. 
- Furnished? 
- Yes. 
I can't think of any. 
- How about that house on the hill? 
- Which house? 
The one as you come into town. 
The Marsten house? 
Is that for sale or rent? 
It's sold. 
I can't think of anything, not offhand. 
You might try Eva Miller's boarding house. 
It's real nice. 
It's on Railroad Street. 
Yeah, I remember. 
- You remember? 
- Thank you very much. 
Funny, about the Marsten house. 
Vacant over 20 years. 
Cully is going to Portland tomorrow. 
Good afternoon, Mr. Crockett. 
You sure fixed it up. 
You think so? 
You like it? 
Fine job. 
Sure is different from that doctor's office I sold you. 
I'd have to agree with you. 
Very tasteful. 
Yes? 
Thank you. 
Mr. Barlow...? 
Will arrive. 
Soon. 
A lot of people have been waiting. 
For Mr. Barlow. 
You know how it is with a small town. 
People don't have that much to do. 
Yes. 
I can assure you that people will find Mr. Barlow well worth the wait. 
I've told him how helpful you've been getting us the house and the store. Especially you, Mr. Crockett. 
Yes. 
Are you a writer? 
Yes. 
What do you write? 
Books. 
Have I read any? 
Have you read any books? 
Your books. 
I don't know. 
How do I get breakfast? 
The kitchen's open to one and all. 
Keep your things stored separate. 
Do you work at night? 
Sometimes. 
You can't work too late- - 
I won't. 
- Well, I hope you like it. 
- I'm sure I will. 
How come you came here? 
The real-estate man sent me. 
No, I meant to Salem's Lot. 
Strangers don't usually come here this time of year. Not yet. 
I'm not a stranger. 
That's no way to leave a book. 
A book by Benjamin. You might rip the binding. 
It is you, isn't it? 
It is you. 
People ought to respect a book. 
Even if it isn't especially well-written. 
It's well-written. 
Do you mind if I sit down? 
No, not at all. 
Why did you call it Air Dancer? 
Did you read the book? 
No, not all of it. 
In fact, I was just getting into it. 
In fact- - 
You got bored. 
No, not in fact. 
I wanted to finish this first. 
I'm going to read it. 
You don't have to. 
What's your name? 
Susan. 
Norton. 
I teach art at Holly Elementary. 
My father's a doctor in town. 
You know, the reason that I actually took your book out of the library is because I read your other one. 
Title? 
I don't remember. 
Do you want to have some dinner? 
You got a boyfriend. 
Well, not exactly. 
It says here you're married, no children. 
Still married? 
Still no children? 
She died. I've got no children. 
Got some memories. 
Some good and some not so good. 
You didn't answer my question. 
Which one? 
Dinner. 
I'd love to. 
Good evening. 
Good night. 
See you tomorrow. And tomorrow night. 
You're sure? 
You're absolutely sure? 
He's got to make a delivery and a pickup. 
Besides, he always calls. 
You know that. 
Good night, honey. 
What are you doing out here, Weasel? 
Sitting. 
Spying more like, huh? 
Oh, no, Parkins. 
Cully set you to it? 
No. 
Better not. 
That writer who moved into Eva's.... 
Right down the hall. 
I heard. 
Can you keep an eye on him? 
What's he done? 
Keep your eye on him and your mouth shut. 
Got that? 
What's he done? 
Murdered 18 people. 
Eighteen people! 
Every one of them an old man who kept asking : 
" What's he done?" 
Keep an eye on him for me. 
Hi, honey. 
What are you watching? 
Nothing. 
You want to stay home tonight? 
Sure, why not? 
Well, don't get drunk. 
I want some fun in tonight. 
You know what happens when you drink too much. 
I'm gonna get something out of the freezer. 
Twenty minutes? 
Bring me a beer. 
Thank you. 
So, you're staying at Eva Miller's. 
I'll tell you, she was quite a dish. 
We kids used to watch her sashaying down the street. 
Well, we did. 
Men. 
Men. 
- Would you like some coffee, Mr. Mears? 
- Yes, please. 
- How do you take it? 
- Black. 
Dad? 
You know what I think. 
You still drink coffee. 
Mornings only, and I don't recommend it. 
Yeah, Eva married this fellow called Weasel Phillips. 
He came up to about here on her. 
Thin as a heron's leg. 
Never made a decent living. Nobody could figure out why. 
They got divorced, but he's still living over there. 
Life in a small town. 
What's his book about? 
Well, his latest one is about two men. 
Not one of those! 
- What are you doing in here? 
- Nothing. 
What's that? 
It's just a piece of paper. There's nothing on it. 
He got a lot of scribbling here, too. 
Something about a boy- - 
A boy and a house. 
" The house was a monument to evil... 
"... sitting there all these years... 
"... holding the essence of evil in its smoldering bones." 
Monument? Who's monument? 
The Marsten house? 
I don't know. He stopped in the middle of the sentence. 
" Sitting there all these years... 
"... holding the essence of evil." 
Writes real good. 
Thank you for the dinner. 
Good to meet you, Mr. Mears. 
I'll get you a copy of that book. 
Sorry about the peas. She's done better. 
'Bye, Dad. 
They liked you. 
Well, your father maybe. 
My mother doesn't like anyone except Ned Tebbets. 
Who's he? 
Someone I've been seeing. 
Have been or had been? 
A little of both. 
What is he really doing in Salem's Lot? 
Writing a book, he says. 
Did he say about what? 
No, he didn't say, and I didn't ask him. 
Tell me about Ned Tibet. 
Tebbets. 
After college? 
New York. 
I worked in an ad agency. 
I was a junior. 
I did layouts mostly and things like that. 
You liked it? 
I loved it. 
But then something happened. 
The agency lost a big account and had to cut back and there I was on the street looking for a job. 
It's a cruel city. 
Anyway- - 
You had to come home. 
Retreat. 
Sanctuary. 
I was all beat up. 
Glad to have a little loving care. 
How long since your wife died? 
Two years. 
Are you writing about that? 
No. 
I'm writing about a house. 
A house? 
The Marsten house. 
The Marsten house? 
I see. 
No, I don't see. 
Where are we going? 
Well, there is the Del. 
The movies in Bangor. 
And then there is the lake. 
And where do you want to go? 
Let's go to the lake. 
Are you uncomfortable with me? 
Why, should I be? 
No, I just have a habit of asking questions. 
Well, I have a habit of evading them. 
Perfect match. 
I like you, Ben. 
Modern, aggressive female, partially liberated, states her feelings. 
Well. 
Does that make you uncomfortable? 
No, it makes me feel good. 
How long will you be staying? 
We'll see how the book comes. 
Are you a slow writer? 
I'm medium. 
I hope it's a long book. 
Crockett Realty. 
Yes, sir. 
Yes. 
Yes, sir. Right away. 
I will be right back. 
Okay, honey. 
Please don't say that. Someday you will forget. 
All right, honey. 
I forgot. 
Getting warmer! 
It's good of you to come over, Mr. Crockett. 
I need your help again. 
Always glad to be of assistance. 
Yes, I appreciate that. 
And as I've told you, you will be amply rewarded. 
I'd like you to have your truck at the Portland docks tonight. 
7 : 00 sharp. 
At the custom house wharf. 
All arrangements have been made. 
7 : 00, custom house. 
Two movers will be sufficient, I think. 
Two men. 
I have a very valuable sideboard that has to be picked up. 
It's to be taken to the house. 
Do you understand? 
Sideboard taken to house. 
And your movers will put it down in the cellar. 
They can get in through the outside bulkhead below the kitchen window, as you know. 
You won't be there? 
No, I must drive into Boston. 
I'll be back tomorrow morning. 
And there's just one other thing : 
You will procure four stout padlocks. 
Four? 
Four. 
Your men will leave the keys for all four locks on the basement table. 
When they leave, they will padlock the bulkhead door, the front door the back door, and the shed... garage. 
You have that? 
I have it. 
Thank you very much, Mr. Crockett. 
I'm extremely pleased that I can always call on you. 
That you can. 
And Mr. Barlow? 
You should be meeting him soon. 
Very soon, Mr. Crockett, and I'm sure that you'll find it a pleasure. 
1776. 
The winds of revolt swept through the township of Jerusalem's Lot soon to be known as Salem's Lot. 
Down with the British. Hurray for freedom. 
Men took out their long rifles, kissed their wives and children goodbye and marched off to join George Washington. 
Daddy, come back safe. 
Daddy, let me come with you. 
I'm old enough to fight. 
I'll be back. 
But not until we've won the right to be free men. 
The war was long and bitter. 
Some men from Salem's Lot fought at Valley Forge suffering through that long, cold winter. 
Others helped gain victory at Saratoga and triumph over Cornwallis. 
And when the war ended.... 
Where is Daddy? 
Won't he ever come home? 
Yes, Salem's Lot had its share of heroes, living and dead but they had fought for the greatest treasure of all : 
Mr. Berk? 
Are the kids still running the pageant? 
What? 
Are the kids still running the school pageant? 
With a little editorial help from me. 
Very little as I remember. 
My name is Ben Mears. 
You probably don't remember me. 
Of course I do. I've read your books. 
I wouldn't have written them if it hadn't been for you. 
You just said a very large thing. 
I'd like you to explain it to me. 
Can we talk about it tonight? 
Sure. 
I don't know how you can work here. 
It'd scare the hell out of me. 
It's kind of nice here, during the day. 
It's pretty and quiet, you know. 
Too quiet. Especially at night. 
I'm hardly ever here at night. They are. 
What's up? 
I need a strong back tonight. 
Want to make $ 50? 
$ 50? 
That's for two of you. 
You're going to need another strong back. 
What about you? 
Me? 
I've got something else planned for tonight. 
Hey there, Teacher. 
Can I carry your books for you? 
Oh, sorry. 
No, that's all right. Do you have your car with you? 
No, I came by to see Jason Berk. 
Told me to wait around. 
Take a walk home. I won't do it again. 
Hey, come on. 
Will you wait for me here, please? 
Get in. 
No. 
You have no right to do this. 
You said you loved me. You said it. 
That was a hundred years ago. 
It has nothing to do with him. 
So you were doing something up at the lake. 
Oh, please. 
What time do you think you'll get home, honey? 
With all the junking around, locking up.... 
Those things take five, six hours. 
Be back midnight or after. 
You stay away from her, you hear? 
I'll try. 
Well, you try real hard. 
She's all mine. 
Right, honey? 
You big bad bear. 
Go on. 
He was just kidding. 
Look, if he suspected anything, would he kid? 
You shouldn't leave your truck double-parked like this. 
Would you want me to go to Portland without saying goodbye to Bonnie? 
What's in Portland? 
I've got to make a pickup. For him. 
Custom wharf. 
Do you know what it is? 
A lot of old junk from Europe, I guess. 
I don't know why anybody would want to open an antique shop here. 
You? 
They know what they're doing. 
Don't leave the truck sitting here like this. 
I might have to ticket you. 
I'll be back to get you. 
Come on now, Faithful. Just calm down. 
I'll be back soon. 
Go play with the people. 
I wouldn't leave a dog in there. 
He's all right. He'll go to sleep in a while. He's a good old dog. 
Faithful, come on. 
I said I'd be back soon. 
Is that dog going to whine all night? 
He'll be all right. 
- You know where to go, what to do? 
- Sure. 
Leave the truck here when you get back. 
I'll pick it up in the morning. 
You bet. 
Shut up! 
What's this all about anyway? 
You got any idea? 
He wants Boom-Boom Bonnie to think he's going to Portland. 
As a matter of fact, Crockett himself set up this trip. 
Larry Crockett? 
What's he got to do with this? 
Larry Crockett and Boom-Boom Bonnie? 
What's he going to do? 
What would you do if you had a 12-gauge sitting in your garage? 
Have a drink? 
I don't mind. 
Canadian on the rocks. 
Got us a native, huh? 
That's what he is. The Return of the Native. 
Or is it the Prodigal Son? 
What did you say was in this? 
A sideboard. 
Sideboard. 
It's funny. 
This crate feels very cold. 
It's been sitting out here. 
I don't like it. 
I mean, it's really strange. It feels cold. 
You want to pry it open? 
You want to pry it open? 
Let's move it out, fellows. 
All right, we're going. 
- Do you want to pry it open? 
- No. 
Let's just get it to the Marsten place. 
Get rid of it. 
Hell of a way to make $ 50. 
It's cold in here. 
Yeah. 
It sure is. It shouldn't be. 
It's a warm night. Turn on the heater. 
That thing is moving. 
What thing? 
Stop the truck. 
- We should open that thing up. 
- We can't do that. 
Something is wrong. It's getting cold in here. 
Let's just get it delivered. 
I want to open it. 
Come on. 
Just let me drive, will you? 
Honey, it's safe. 
Oh, Tiger, I'm going to lose respect for you. 
No. 
I don't want to go to a motel again. 
I want you right here in my own little bed. 
It's more exciting to me that way. 
No. 
No, I'm not going to talk like that on the phone. 
You just get over here and I'll whisper things in your ear that will make your hair stand up. 
You get here, or else. 
" 1951. A fire started in the old mill. 
" It spread rapidly on both sides of Griffin Road... 
"... and burned toward the Marsten house on Pabscuitti Hill.

" It spread rapidly on both sides of Griffin Road...

" The wind turned the fire back toward town. 
" Volunteer fire companies came from all- -" 
Mark! 
Whatever are you doing? 
Rehearsing for the pageant. 
Keep it down. Your father's trying to figure his quarterly taxes. 
All right. Mother, Danny and Ralphie Glick are coming over after they finish their homework. 
We'll rehearse. 
Have you finished your homework? 
Yes, a long time ago. 
All right. 
Just as long as you and the Glick boys don't disturb your father. 
"... the Marsten house on Pabscuitti Hill. 
" The wind turned the fire back toward town. 
" Volunteer fire companies came from all over the county... 
"... to help fight the threatening flames." 
Bright boy, Mark Petrie. Wrote most of the pageant this year, just as you did. 
Both talented. 
Another writer. 
Very possibly. I'd certainly be proud if I'd helped develop two authors. 
It will make a lifetime of teaching worthwhile. 
You got me started. 
You had the gift. I wanted the opportunity to continue, but you moved away. 
Let's see, you were.... 
Eleven. 
Tell me, why the Marsten house? 
I remember that figured in your pageant, too. 
Maybe because my aunt worked there. 
Did she ever tell you anything about what went on inside the house? 
No, never. 
Or Hubie Marsten? 
No, she never talked about him. 
But you remember that even then that house had a reputation for being a haunted house. 
Every town has one. 
I went up there once. 
On a dare. You know how kids are. 
I was sweating scared. 
I sneaked around. 
Got into the house. 
What did you see? 
Ghosts, everything. 
Every sound, every shadow. 
I'm not sure what I saw. 
I think I saw Hubie Marsten hanging by his neck. 
His face green, his eyes puffed shut his hands livid. 
It was ghastly. 
And then he opened his eyes and he looked at me. 
He looked at me and I took off and I ran. 
I've never forgotten that. 
And there was something. A feeling of.... 
Jason, do you believe a thing can be inherently evil? 
I've seen trees that look like tortured spirits. 
A house. 
The Marsten house for instance. 
Can it be evil in its stone foundations, in its wooden beams? 
In the glass of its windows? 
In the plaster of its ceilings? 
Evil. 
The man who built that house... 
Yeah, Joshua Von. 
... killed his wife and a servant and hanged himself in his bedroom closet. 
Hubie Marsten's sister and wife died mysteriously. 
Then he came here. 
And the young boys in the area started to disappear. 
Some people suspected Hubie Marsten, but it was never proved. 
Never proved. 
And now we have a Mr. Straker. 
And a Mr. Barlow. 
Whom no one has ever seen. 
And you think- - 
I think that an evil house attracts evil men. 
But if a house attracts evil men.... 
Why did it attract me? 
It is moving. 
Look at it! 
We're almost there. Now shut up. 
Shut up! 
What's this one? 
It's a ghoul. 
Girl? 
Ghoul. 
Like in school. 
We don't have anybody like that in our school. 
Mr. Peterson. 
What is a ghoul? 
A ghoul is an evil demon who preys on corpses feeds on human beings, robs graves. 
Why are you so hung up on this stuff? 
I don't know, I just am. 
It's weird. 
Let's try this. 
Danny, Ralphie, your mom called. Wants you home. 
Okay, Mr. Petrie. 
We know our lines okay, don't we? 
Most of them. 
Why don't you come over to our house tomorrow night, okay? 
- Okay, Mr. Petrie? 
- Sure. 
- See you later. 
- Bye-bye. See you. 
Good night, boys. 
Mark, when are you going to outgrow all this? 
Soon, I guess. 
Well, I'd better fix this. 
Well? 
Look. 
The road. 
The road, nothing. 
It sure is cold. Come on, let's get it done. 
It's freezing! 
I'm telling you, it's not natural. 
It just ain't natural. 
We've got to get it out. 
Just grab ahold. Let's get it done. 
What was that? 
It's just an owl. 
I've never heard one before. 
Sure you have. Hundreds of times. Millions. 
We shouldn't have gone through the woods. 
It's a shortcut. Look, you can even see the lights of Jordan Avenue. See them? 
No. 
Hey, I'm going. 
Wait. Danny, wait! 
Hey, I want to know. 
Come on. Come on. 
I want to pry it open. 
We can't. He'll hear. 
Who? 
Him. 
Straker. 
Well, I want to do it anyway. 
I'll get something from the truck. 
Listen. 
You hear that? 
Somebody's up there. 
There's somebody up there. 
Rats probably. 
You heard rats. 
It was someone. Let's split. 
The padlocks. We forgot to padlock- - 
Throw them down there. 
Here are the keys, throw them down too. 
Close the doors. 
Did you happen to notice the time when the boys left? 
They should have been here a half hour ago. 
Ask Mark if the boys said anything to him. 
You know how kids are. 
Henry! 
Danny, what happened? 
What happened, Son? 
Where's Ralphie? 
Where's your brother? 
I don't know. 
Get Dr. Norton. 
See ya. 
Yeah. 
Faithful. 
Here, boy. 
Is that better? 
It's better here, isn't it? 
Well, well, well. 
I guess I owe Weasel Phillips a case of beer after all. 
Cully, look, this isn't.... 
He broke in. He tried to rape me. 
He was? 
He broke in. 
A rapist. 
Is that it? 
I'll take care of him. 
I didn't. 
Shut up, rapist! 
Get up! 
Out of the bed. 
Out of the bed! 
Out! 
Get up. 
Shut up! 
Please don't do anything. 
You don't want to go to jail, do you? 
I'm not going to jail for killing the man who raped my wife. 
That is what he did, isn't it, honey? 
Yes. 
No! 
She invited me, I swear. 
You invited him? 
No! 
He called me and he said that he had to talk to me and.... 
So you invited him over? 
Cully, no. 
Cully, you don't want to go to jail for the rest of your life for what is a lie. 
Come here. 
Come on. Come in the living room. 
We've got to talk this over. 
Right, let's talk it over. 
We'll go in the living room and we'll talk it over. 
And then I'm coming back, hear me? 
Come on, Larry. 
In the living room. Man-to-man stuff. 
I like your shorts. 
You must too, keeping them on like that. 
Where did you get them? 
Boston. 
They sure look good on you. 
Stay right there, puss. 
Turn around, Larry. 
Look, I know how this must look to you. 
I can understand how upset you are but let me explain what happened. 
Grab the barrel, Larry. 
The barrel. Grab the barrel. 
Easy! 
Very easy. 
That's it. 
Now, this shotgun's got a five-pound pull on it and I've got about three on it now. 
Good boy. 
Now hold it up in front of your face. 
That's it. Right in front. 
That's it. Right in front. 
Careful. 
You move that barrel, Larry, and I'll blow you away. 
Good. 
Just hold it, Larry. 
Hold it steady. 
Steady, Larry. 
Don't move! 
Don't move! 
There. 
You see how much self-control you can have? 
It's terrific. 
You're doing fine, Larry. 
Just fine. 
Close your eyes, Larry. 
Close them. 
Here I come, puss. 
Here comes big bad bear. 
I know you're going to say," Don't make a big thing out of this." 
No, I wasn't going to say that. 
Maybe" Look, I can't make any commitments right now." 
I wasn't going to say that either. 
What were you going to say? 
I wasn't going to say anything. 
I told you, I ask too many questions. 
And I don't give enough answers. 
Maybe we talk too much. 
Maybe we do. 
Sounds like a traffic jam. 
Maybe they saw our car. 
I'm going to take a look. 
Crockett? 
You heard another car drive off. Then? 
Car or truck. 
Which one? 
I don't know. 
You don't know. 
Do you? 
No. 
Where were you people? 
We were over there. 
Over there? 
Parkins? 
Come here, will you? 
You heard two cars. 
Or a car and a truck. 
One drove off, and then? 
One more thing. 
I think I heard someone get out of one car. 
I'm only supposing that because I didn't see it. 
And get in the other car, or truck. 
That's what I think. 
That's what you think. 
Quite a night, huh? 
First the kid disappears, then this. 
You're not leaving Salem's Lot, are you? 
I'm not leaving. 
Don't. 
It's late. 
Where are you going? 
To the hospital. 
Danny Glick has collapsed. 
What? 
Ralphie Glick, Danny and Larry Crockett all in one night. 
Quiet little town of Salem's Lot. 
It's only all just happened since.... 
Since I came here. 
You didn't have anything to do with it. You didn't even know the Glick boys. 
Or Larry Crockett. 
I met Larry Crockett. 
I did see the boys rehearsing for the school play. 
That's not what I'm thinking. 
You remember I came here to rent the Marsten house? 
Yeah. 
Somehow I.... 
I think that my coming here has acted as a kind of catalyst awakening evil in this town. 
That's- - 
Nonsense. 
How is he? 
Danny's never had an attack of asthma, has he? 
No. 
His file's with Dr. Goldring. 
All right. I'll get the file from Goldring, but for now.... 
Any history of rheumatic fever? 
Danny? 
No. 
He's a healthy boy. 
No major problems. 
Has he had a TB skin test this year? 
TB? 
Danny's got TB? 
No, no. Marjorie, we're just trying to find out. 
He's a healthy boy. 
He's athletic. 
He's a normal boy. 
We want to keep him here for some more tests. 
What tests? 
We just don't know yet. 
Have you seen my dog? 
No, I ain't seen him. 
Have two men cover this area. 
Come on, move it. 
Let's go. 
That's it. 
Don't touch that. 
Noah, get me an envelope! 
He always wears a black suit. 
Who? 
Straker. 
Inspector. How nice of you to drop in. 
Plain old constable. 
I see you're just about ready to open. 
Not quite. Just about. 
Everything in? 
Everything that's important, yes. 
Coffee? 
Tea? 
A glass of sherry perhaps? 
No, thanks. 
Never drink on duty? 
You are on duty. 
I'm always on duty. 
That makes me feel safe and snug. 
Mr. Barlow arrived yet? 
Mr. Barlow's in New York. 
Coming soon? 
Hard to tell. He may go to Europe on a buying trip. 
So, you'll be opening without him? 
If necessary, yes. Of course. 
What's Mr. Barlow's first name, by the way? 
Official question? 
No. Just curious. 
My partner's full name is Kurt Barlow. 
Kurt with a" K." 
We've been working together in London and Hamburg. 
This is our retirement. 
Modest, comfortable. 
We're hoping to build a reputation for ourselves in this area. 
Perhaps throughout New England. Do you think that's possible? 
Anything's possible. 
How do you like that old house? 
Needs work. 
But we have time. 
Not bothered by" yowens"? 
" Yowens?" 
Kids. Local word. 
You know how kids like to devil new folks. 
No, no. No children. No. 
We seem to have misplaced one. 
Is that so? 
Yes. Yes, it is so. 
The thinking now is that we may not find him. Not alive. 
That's a shame. Is there anything I can do to help you? 
I don't suppose so. 
By the way, what happened to your black suit? 
My black suit? 
The one I always see you wear. 
I have two black suits. They're up at the house. 
Am I breaking some town ordinance? 
No. 
I'd like to see those suits. Could we go to the house and get them? 
I'll bring them down tomorrow. They need cleaning anyway. 
Any reason? 
Some. 
'Bye. 
Ciao, Constable. 
Ciao? 
" Ciao." That's a familiar Italian expression meaning" goodbye." 
I didn't know you're Italian. 
I'm not. The word is. 
You learn something new every day. 
No, it is not a kidnap. 
The boy is missing. 
Probable foul play. 
Yeah, I'd like to check a couple of feelers. 
The first is Benjamin Mears. 
Writer. 
The book is called Air Dancer. 
And the other one is Conwey's Daughter. 
No, I haven't read them. 
I don't know if many have. 
The other two are sort of stapled together. 
There is a Richard K. Straker. 
No, I don't know what that stands for. 
And Kurt, with a" K," Barlow. 
S-T-R-A-K-E-R. 
B-A-R-L-O-W. 
Any connection between Mears and the others? 
That's one of the things I want to find out. 
I understand what you're saying, Ben. 
I'm not given to unscientific belief, but I will admit that there are many things that science hasn't yet answered. 
If ever. 
But I can't, for the life of me understand any connection between Crockett's death and the Marsten house. 
He rented the house to them. 
But he died of a heart attack. 
- You're sure of that? 
- Absolutely. 
The autopsy left no doubt whatsoever. 
It could've happened at the Marsten house and he was taken to the lake. 
Let me tell you, the local gossip leans in a different direction. 
All right, what about the Glick boys? 
That could be something else. 
What is wrong with Danny Glick? 
We haven't completed our tests yet but it could be, and I'm trusting you to keep this to yourself it could be pernicious anemia. 
Coming on overnight? 
We don't know how sudden it is. 
You don't really believe that? 
Ready? 
We're going to a movie in Bangor. 
Can I say something to you? 
Don't make it too long, Dad. 
Now everybody knows that you and Susan were up at the lake. 
Yeah. I want you to know- - 
You seem like a pretty nice fellow to me and I think you respect Susan, and I believe she respects herself but you could've been more discreet. 
When may I expect them back? 
A couple of days. 
No more than that, please. 
I'll try. 
I don't have to do this, you know. 
Understand. Appreciate it. 
I'm under some suspicion? 
Well, yes. 
The disappearance of the boy. 
Yes. 
Because I'm a stranger. 
I guess so. 
And a little odd. 
You know how we are here. 
No different from people in small towns all over the world. 
I appreciate your candor. 
Am I being charged? 
No, but I'd like you to stay around. 
I fully intend to. 
Now, the suits. 
Don't forget. 
As soon as Crime Lab.... 
fbi. 
In Bangor. 
And no damage, please. I want them back in excellent condition. 
And cleaned. 
I'll see to it. 
Ciao. 
That's Italian for- - 
I remember. 
Goodbye, Constable. 
Playing hooky? 
No. 
It's my hour break of which exactly 26 minutes is left. 
I just wanted to say hello. 
My father asked you to be discreet. 
I didn't tell you that. 
No, he did. And he told me to go ahead and show my feelings. 
Yeah, the man contradicts himself. 
Well, Dad's a New Englander. 
He has been taught one thing, and feels another. 
Classic conflict. 
I have one too. 
I got a phone call this morning. 
Ned? 
Not that easy. 
From Boston. A job interview. 
They saw my portfolio. 
It will only be for two days. 
No, thanks. 
So it's off to Boston. 
It's not that far. 
When do you leave? 
Tomorrow after class. 
Can you come with me? 
Danny Glick's funeral is tomorrow. 
I want to stay for that. 
Why? 
I just need to be there. 
I wish you weren't going. 
Me, too. 
I have to. 
Where are you staying? 
With a friend. 
A girlfriend. 
I'll give you the number if you'd like. 
Yeah, okay. 
It's only an interview. If I get the job, I wouldn't have to start until June. 
That's not so bad, is it? 
Well, I guess it'll have to do. 
Let us pray. 
" Lord God, through Your mercy, may those who have lived in faith find eternal peace. 
" Bless this grave and send Your angel to watch over it. 
" As we bury the body of Danny Glick welcome him into Your presence... 
"... and with Your saints let him rejoice in Your presence forever. 
" We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen. 
" Amen. 
" With faith in Jesus Christ, we reverently bring the body of this child... 
"... to be buried in its human imperfection." 
Have plans for tonight? 
More or less. 
Susan's gone to Boston. 
I heard. 
I hope she gets it. 
Do you? 
Whatever is best. 
Should I believe that? 
Not entirely, but that's what I want to feel. 
Everything is all right? 
I'm glad I stayed. 
How about the job? 
Tomorrow? 
So when are you coming home? 
Friday. 
Well, there's really not much point, is there? 
No. 
Tonight I'm having dinner with Jason Berk. 
Just Jason and me. 
I miss you too. 
Ned Tebbets was around here today, fixing a toilet and threatening to fix you. 
I just thought I'd tell you. 
You're a nice guy. 
I'd hate to see you get all busted up. 
Thanks. 
He's got to be feeling something. 
I mean, after all, the Glick boys were on their way home from seeing him. 
Did you look at him at the funeral? 
He keeps his feelings in hand. 
I don't want him going in the woods anymore. 
I'll go up and see him. 
How are you, Son? 
Fine, Dad. 
Finished your homework? 
A long time ago. 
Can you get out of these? 
Easy. Put them on me. 
Go ahead. 
Let's see. 
Where's the key? 
I don't need it. 
Not too tight? 
I want it tight. 
There. 
What do you know! 
You want to tie me up? 
I don't think so. 
I can get out of any knot. Try me. 
Hands behind my back. 
Some other time, Son. 
Sometimes I wonder why you're so interested in monsters and magic and.... 
Why do you think that is, Mark? 
I always have been. 
I can't explain it. It's the way I am. 
Like you were interested in numbers, so you became an accountant. 
At least I can earn a living. 
I'll earn a living. 
That's it? 
Thanks. 
Hey, wait. 
Just had fbi, Boston on the phone. 
Run down on Ben Mears, Straker and Barlow. 
What did they say? 
Straker is British by birth. 
Fifty-eight years old. 
Applied for extended visa 18 months ago. 
No criminal record at all. 
Barlow? 
Born in Germany. Left in' 20s before Hitler. 
Naturalized British. Changed his name from Brikin. 
Anything else? 
Been in the import-export business with Straker since 1943. 
He travels alone. Seems to keep to himself. 
Straker's the one who stays in front. Has he shown up yet? 
Barlow? 
No. 
What about Mears? 
He was born here, in Salem's Lot. 
Left at the age of 10. 
His wife died in an automobile accident two years ago. 
He's a left-winger. 
Against nuclear power, stuff like that. 
No record? 
Travels a lot. 
No connection between Mears and the other two? 
Wouldn't say so. 
Then why is he so interested in the Marsten house? 
And why did they buy it? 
There's a connection, I'm telling you. 
Well, how's the book coming? 
Hard. 
Tough way to make a living. 
Well, it's not much of a living, but it's the only way I know. 
Is the Marsten house still center of the story? 
Yep. 
What about the Glick boys? 
Did you connect them with the house? 
Everything here's connected with it. 
You can see it in every part of the town. 
It's like a beacon throwing off an energy force. 
Are you on something? 
No. 
Drugs? 
Sick. I feel sick. 
Since when? 
First, I found my dog dead. 
And then, there was the funeral yesterday. 
I fell asleep on Harmony Hill. Didn't wake up until morning. 
This was after Danny Glick's funeral? 
Yeah. 
I went back to finish. 
Royal wasn't there. 
I started to feel sick. 
Can I have a drink? 
Miss. Whiskey. 
What do you remember, Mike? 
Singing. 
Singing? 
Sweet.... 
Sweetest singing I've ever heard. 
I'm feeling like drowning in it. 
And eyes. 
Eyes. 
Whose eyes? 
Bright and scary. 
Whose? 
I don't remember. 
I dreamed. 
You slept there all night? 
Yeah, all night. 
What about last night? 
I remember a dream. 
Somebody out there. 
I let him in. 
Who? 
I don't know. 
Listen to me, Mike. 
Mike, I want you to stay at my house tonight. 
Will you do that for me? 
We'll arrange to see Dr. Norton tomorrow. 
All right. 
I don't care. 
Open the window. 
Open the window, Mark. 
Open the window, Mark. 
Please. 
Let me in. 
It's okay, Mark, I'm your friend. 
He commands it. 
No, Mark. 
Go away. 
Go away! 
Son, are you awake? 
Yeah, kind of. 
Did you have a bad dream? 
Maybe. 
I don't remember. 
You called out in your sleep. 
I'm sorry. 
Do you want anything? 
No. 
Good night, then. 
Good night, Dad. 
Come in. 
I hope these will be all right. 
Turn your head, Mike. 
This way. 
Where did you get these marks? 
I don't know. 
Call me in the night if you want anything. 
Anything. 
Even if you have a bad dream. 
Will you be sure to do that? 
Anything, I mean it. 
I'll be right down the hall. 
I will. 
Mr. Mears, telephone. 
Telephone. 
All right. Just a minute. 
What, is it long distance? 
No, it's Jason Berk. 
What time is it? 
It's a little after 4 : 00. 
Mr. Berk sounds very upset. 
Yeah, Jason? 
What's the matter? 
Well, give me about ten minutes. 
Well, no. I'm... 
I was a Baptist. 
Do you have a rosary or a crucifix? 
In my bedroom. Mr. Berk asked for it? 
Yes, please. 
He's not Catholic. 
I don't even think he goes to church. 
Please. 
He's all right, Jason. 
He's sleeping. 
The window's open. 
It was closed and locked. 
I made sure of it. 
The sun's coming up. 
Look. 
It's blood. 
A single drop. 
Mike, wake up. 
There is no pulse. 
Marks on the neck? 
No. 
Nothing. 
No marks. 
Nothing. 
Do you think I'm crazy? 
No. 
- Do you believe me about the marks? 
- I guess I'll have to. 
But where does that put us, Jason? 
It puts us in the position where we have to do something. 
Could he have died of a virus or something? 
The window, the marks on his neck, and I heard him invite someone into the room. 
That terrible laughter. 
Do you know what will happen to you if we whisper a word of what you just told me? 
Funny old duck living alone. How can we trust him to teach our children? 
I can't help you, Jason. 
I saw a body. 
Nothing else. 
And I'm an outsider. A writer. A crazy. 
If we do nothing.... 
There is something we can do. 
We can check this all out. 
Call Dr. Norton. 
Call the constable. 
Let the machinery take over. 
Don't even tell Dr. Norton he's dead. 
- Not dead! 
- But how do we know he is? 
Let the medical people check it out. 
Let them find the cause of death. 
All the times Mike drove that not guessing how soon he'd be riding in the back. 
Mears, I want you to testify for the coroner's jury. 
I'll be there. 
Good. 
Better do my paperwork. 
Duplicate, triplicate. 
Don't punch, spindle or mutilate. 
We all have to do that, don't we? 
Yeah. 
They say it's a free country. 
What is it you wanted to tell me? 
Have there been any other people complaining of feeling weak? 
Well, bad dreams? 
No. 
There soon will be. 
Bill, do you believe in ghosts? 
Ghosts? 
No. 
- Witches? 
Wizards? 
- No. 
- Werewolves? 
- Of course not. 
Vampires? 
Bill, come on inside. I'm going to tell you something. 
And I'm going to ask your help. 
And maybe you'll give it if you don't decide I'm absolutely crazy. 
Good morning, Eva. 
I heard. 
Awful. 
Poor Mike. 
I'm tired. 
I'll just have a cup of coffee and get some sleep. 
Why in the world did Mr. Berk want that crucifix? 
Maybe he thought that Mike Ryerson was Catholic. 
He should've known better. He had Mike in school. 
All his people were Lutherans. 
Looks like you'll miss the opening. 
What opening? 
Those antique fellas. 
Straker? 
Yeah, him and the other fellow. 
Did that other fellow ever show up? 
I don't know about that. All I know is they're opening the store today. 
Wouldn't Dad like this? 
I guess so. 
My husband's birthday is next week and.... 
Oh, dear. 
It's quite reasonable. 
There's no chance that.... 
I'm sorry, but.... 
I understand. 
I could hold it for you until the end of the week without any obligation. 
Oh, I'd appreciate that. Thank you. 
Done. 
An English desk here, 18th century. 
Values continue to escalate. 
Interesting little Welsh cupboard in oak. 
And my favorite chair. 
It was with me in London in my establishment. 
English. 
Georgian. 
You have some expertise. 
No, not really. 
I just know something about silver. 
My aunt had some Georgian and we had to sell it when she died. 
What an unfortunate way to acquire knowledge. 
My aunt was housekeeper at the Marsten house. 
Your house. 
Really? That's interesting. 
I've always been curious about that place. 
Perhaps I can satisfy your curiosity. 
A lot of peculiar things have happened in that house. 
The man who built it murdered his wife and a servant. 
It was never proved, but he was suspected in the disappearance of several children. 
Yes, it was terrible, wasn't it? 
Interesting. 
Remarkable, yes. 
Mr. Straker. 
Yes? 
Do you believe that evil can be inherent in a house? 
About as much as I believe that trees have souls. 
Perhaps they do. 
Oh, you're the writer. 
On vacation or vocation? 
I am writing about the Marsten house. 
And you'd like to visit. 
Well, why not? Mr. Barlow is on a buying trip. 
But, the moment he arrives.... 
You'll enjoy Mr. Barlow. 
He'll enjoy you. 
You snake! 
Try to steal my girl. 
Pretty good beating you took, fellow. 
No fractures. 
Slight concussion. 
You understand me? 
Yes. 
Good. 
We'll keep you here overnight for observation, all right? 
Yes. 
Your friend Ned, he was arrested. 
He's sitting in the town jail. 
I don't think he'll be that foolish again. 
Anyone else sick in the hospital? 
Couple of new admissions, but nothing.... 
No. 
What Jason and I told you.... 
Ben, it's out of the question. I don't believe it and no one else will. 
You just take it easy, all right? 
I want a crucifix. 
All right. If it'll make you feel better, we can arrange it. 
Look at me. 
Look at me, Teacher. 
Look. 
Look. 
Look. 
Look. 
Look at me. 
Look at me. 
Look. 
No. 
Look. 
Look. 
No! 
No. 
Get out. 
Get out. 
I revoke my invitation. 
You'll sleep by the dead, Teacher. 
No! 
Marge? 
Marjorie? 
Marjorie? 
Honey? 
What is it? 
What are you saying? 
Marge, I'll call a doctor. 
No! 
You sure? 
I'm okay. 
I want Dr. Norton to see you. 
No! 
I'm weak. 
Real weak. 
You haven't been sleeping ever since.... 
I've been dreaming about him. 
About Danny. 
That's natural. It's all right. 
He comes back and he says," Mommy, I'm so glad to be home." 
He says he's my baby. 
My baby. 
Dad called me. 
It was just a little knock. 
I know you're okay. 
There's more, Ben. 
Ned Tebbets died last night. 
What? 
They found him dead this morning in the town jail. 
Dad examined him. 
Pernicious anemia. 
Just like the Glick boy. 
Only Ned had high blood pressure. 
And Danny's mother died this afternoon. 
Same symptoms? 
I think so. 
What does your father say? 
He wants to talk to you. 
And Jason Berk. 
Jason Berk? 
He's here, Ben. 
In the hospital. 
Intensive Care. 
What? 
Heart attack. 
He is stable. 
You've got to go back to Boston. 
There is a kind of plague in this town. People are dying. 
Don't you understand what's happening? 
- Do you? 
- I do. 
It's in the Marsten house. 
It's got to be rooted out. 
It's got to be destroyed. 
Do you know the priest of St. Jude's? 
Father Callahan? 
But I'm an agent of the Holy Catholic Church. 
The overall concept of evil in the Catholic Church has undergone a radical change in this century. 
Evil with a small" E." 
Satan with a small tail. Witches, incubi? 
Vampires? 
In Salem's Lot. 
Haven't you noticed anything out of the way, peculiar? 
The Malloys weren't at mass this morning. 
Mrs. Malloy never misses. 
Mrs. Glick. 
But she'd suffered a terrible blow. 
Ned Tebbets. 
Mike Ryerson. 
- He'll do it. 
- At least we'll know then. 
We'll have the medical evidence. Now, listen to me. 
You'll have to get some hawthorn. 
Okay. 
- And just put it all over the house. 
- Okay. 
The crucifixes from Father Callahan- - 
- Mother's never- - 
- She has to! 
They're breeding on one another. The vampires are creating vampires. 
It's a geometric progression. 
Two times two times four, times eight. 
And another couple- - 
Ned Tebbets's body has disappeared, and a baby that died this morning is gone. 
Marjorie Glick? 
She's in the funeral parlor in Cumberland. 
I'll get my car. 
Hawthorn. 
I think a lot of this comes from Mark's hobby. 
Collecting masks and assembling monsters from kits. 
He's always been preoccupied with them, and it's not healthy. 
Let's not make judgments now. 
Mark, you're sure it wasn't a dream? 
It wasn't a dream. 
It was Danny Glick. 
Nightmares seem real. 
His subconscious fear made Danny seem real to him. 
And they were very close friends. 
I'll get it. 
Poor little boy. 
You can do nothing against the master. 
Stop, Holy man! 
Or he'll cut the boy's throat. 
Back. Back, Holy man. 
Back, Shaman. 
Back, Priest! 
What would you give for this miserable boy? 
What do you ask? 
What would you give to reprieve him this night to save him for another night? 
What do you want? 
The master wants you. 
Throw away your cross, face the master. 
Your faith against his faith. 
Could you do that? 
Is your faith enough? 
Then do it. 
And trust him to let the boy go? 
Run. 
I think they're dead, Father. 
Run! 
I'm going to kill you! 
Now it's your part of the bargain. 
I'm a priest. 
A priest? 
Throw away the cross. 
Face the master. 
Faith against faith. 
What do you think? 
The condition is very similar to Mike's. 
There's no surface lividity, no signs of rigor. 
I'll call home, make sure they're all right. 
They'll be fine if they follow instructions. 
I'll make sure they do. 
Bless this cross in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost. 
" The Lord is my shepherd... 
"... I shall not want. 
" He maketh me.... 
" He maketh me to lie down beside the still waters. 
" He maketh me to lie down. 
" He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. 
" He restoreth my soul. 
" He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake." 
Bill! 
" Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... 
"... I will fear no evil. 
" I will fear no evil. 
" Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me." 
Danny. 
Where are you, Danny darling? 
Don't look at her eyes. 
I called a friend of mine in San Francisco. 
He's turned on to the occult. 
He says that we have to get to Barlow during the day before sunset in his coffin and drive a stake through his heart. 
How about Straker? 
Straker's human. 
He's mortal. 
He's the watchdog. 
He's the thing's bodyguard. He prepares the way. 
How can he be killed? 
Any way, any way at all. 
Gun, knife- - 
Any way at all. 
Why did they come here? 
How the hell do I know? 
Because you're somewhat isolated, you're somewhat inbred. Full-blooded. 
Barlow must've wandered this planet for centuries looking for new places to victimize. 
This is unbelievable. 
I have seen it. 
Still, Ben it's unbelievable. 
Good girl. 
- Where's your mother? 
- In your room. 
- She's all right? 
- She's fine. 
What happened? 
Marjorie Glick rose and joined the undead. 
Undead? 
She's a vampire, too. 
Soon this whole town of Salem's Lot.... 
You'll have to leave town. 
Mother and Dad? 
Your father's going to stay and help me destroy this creature. 
Tomorrow, before sunset, you take your mother and anyone else that you can persuade to go and you leave town. 
Where's Gillespie? 
Parkins called in sick. 
This is the first day he's been off the job ever. 
Are you all right? 
A little tired. 
I didn't sleep much last night. 
I was dreaming. 
Funny. 
Dreaming about Ned coming to see me. 
It was a funny dream. 
He may have gone into town. 
You look pale. 
Are you all right? 
Just tired. 
I dreamed all night. 
All night. 
Sweet, sweet dreams. 
Weasel. 
Young. 
Just like old times. 
Kissing me on my neck. 
Oh, Weasel! 
Maybe you better go lie down. 
Yes, I will. 
What are you doing here? 
I followed you in. 
Let's get out of here. 
He killed my parents. 
You can't do it. 
My father and Ben.... 
Listen. 
Please. 
You go. 
Only if you go. 
I can't. 
We'll come back with my father and Ben. 
They'll help us. 
We need help. 
What's that? 
He's here. 
Come. 
That'll hold you until tonight. 
What will happen tonight? 
Yes. 
What have you done with Susan? 
What did you do to her? 
I've taken her to where she wished to go. 
To meet the man she came here to meet. 
Where are you going? 
South Carolina. To visit relatives. 
You can't do that. He's up there, in the house. 
Who? 
Barlow. 
He's a vampire. He's got to be destroyed. 
What the hell is so funny? 
- You're crazy. There's no such thing. 
- Then what do you say is happening? 
- I don't know. Craziness. 
- You're scared! 
I'm not staying. 
- You're the constable. 
- Was. 
- Running? 
- Running! 
And you're staying? 
You're staying. 
All right, since you're staying, come here. 
Come here, will you? 
Here. Here. 
Maybe this'll do you some good. 
Coming! 
This town's falling apart and you're running? 
Gillespie is leaving town. 
Have you seen Susan? 
They should be gone by now. 
No. Anne's still waiting for her at home. 
Father Callahan in there? 
No one's there. 
Blessed? 
It is holy water. 
Ben, Susan's in there! 
They're in there. 
Where? 
I don't know. 
You run. 
You run as fast as you can. 
Keep running! 
I told you to go. 
Run! 
No! 
Help me! 
Help me! 
It's getting dark. 
The cellar. 
Wait. 
Mark, wait. 
Mark, wait! 
I'm all right. 
It's just the ankle. 
Can you stand? 
He's here. 
I know he's here somewhere. 
Here. 
It's the root cellar. 
We have to get him out of here. 
Must weigh a ton. 
We have to get him out of here. 
Push! 
The sun's gone down. 
Don't look at him! 
Mark, get out. 
Susan? 
Sorry, Susan. 
Forgive me. 
The wind. 
It's blowing towards town. 
The town will burn. 
It will drive them out of their hiding places. 
All of them? 
No. 
It will purify Salem's Lot. 
And the others will be on the run. 
And on the hunt. 
For us? 
For us. 
They found us again. 
Another one has found us. 
We have to go further. 
Not yet. 
I found you. 
I know. 
I love you. 
Yes. 
You were so difficult to find. 
I know. 
But we're together now. 
We'll always be together. 
We'll always be young. 
We'll love each other. 
Forever. 
That is his promise. 
Forever? 
Forever. 
Kiss me. 
Kiss me. 
Kiss me. 
There'll be others. 
Do we go now? 
In the spring of the, now long gone, year of 1968. 
it seemed to me that everyone have women of their lives, except me. 
Time passed by unrelently and I had strong feeling that soon something will happen to me, something grand and beautiful. 
I will fall in love. 
Yes, I will fall in love. 
I shorted my list and from that shorten list I singled out her. 
New professor of sociology, Nevena Moreno. 
All around her, she spread smell of south fruit, tropical seas and mornings after rain. 
But most important was that, she singled out me from the crowd. 
She looked at me. 
Because of her, just because of her, 
I've decided to take marxism for my marticulate theme. 
THE ELUSIVE SUMMER OF' 68 
At first, my choice was really surprising for my father. 
So, marxism? 
So suddenly? 
Through the whole year C, and now. 
Listen... 
Maybe you made a mistake? 
You know what that means to me. 
Don't change your mind by any chance. 
No, no. 
That and nothing else. 
Then, I'm proud of you. 
Barely 18 years old and already getting involved with giant of world's social idea. 
Son, look your father right in the eyes. 
You've made a descision that will meant a great deal in your life. 
I'll get somebody to help you. 
I'll do it by myself, I don't need anybody. 
Just to be sure. 
You listen to me. 
We gotta make it in our life. 
Modern society is made in that way, that every opposition turn to be useful at the end. 
You listen to me? - I do. 
- You don't listen anything. 
You oughta be ashame. 
And shame is form of revolution. 
- Here you are, conserve. 
Is that you, Vladica? 
- Here you are. 
Dad appointed student Cile to help me after all. 
He insisted that we together follow world's political events. 
He think that will help me with my marticular theme that I have chosen for my exam. 
He was death boring to me but he had cocnclusively influence on my sister Vladica. 
Dear viewers, good evening. 
In the beginining we'll have review of the most important domestic and worlds events. 
After 12 hours of demonstration in Paris, that turned into real battles between students and the police, there is nothing but desolation. 
What happened and what still can happened made rude wake up call from the dream about best of all the worlds. 
Busted skulls and other fructures don't count anymore. 
That's the battle that haven't been seen on the Parisian ground from the Second World War. 
Clashes, charged with hatred, are atrocious. 
At that time, my father have been preparing three months ahead for the duck hunting season. 
My younger brother Tadija, enjoyed in his childhood. 
You're done? 
He's sitting here for a half an hour and you didn't noticed. 
What is there to be noticed? 
Today I'm cleaning my guns. 
Don't bother me with some nonsense. 
It's over! 
It's getting close. 
- What? 
- Demonstrations. 
Student Cile says... 
- You hear what she's talking? 
What Cile! 
- Vladica, don't disturb your father. 
Tadija, you're too big to poop in the chamber-pot. 
You hear me? - I do. 
- So? 
- This way is better. 
And why? 
- Someone else is doing all instead of you. 
Mom, like every mom, had a job over her head. 
Get out! 
Begone! 
And don't you ever come into my house again! 
Father threw Cile out. 
He considered that he has negative affect on us. 
And politics didn't interested me at all. 
Day and night I was fantasizing about my professor of sociology, 
Nevena Moreno. 
I've decided to punish her cruely, and not to speak a word with her ever again. 
Petar, what's the meaning of Marx's concept of revolution? 
I knew that I will fail on exam but I stayed tough and resolute. 
Alright, tell me, who is only capable to accomplish revolution? 
Petar! 
Tadija, sit properly! 
Let's have lunch! 
Bravo, my son, bravo! 
Just like me, pass the exam from the first try. 
Right on time! 
Foundations of healthy diet, remeber that well, are : 
Green today, red tomorrow, and yellow day after tomorrow. 
More vegetables. 
Peas, tomato, paprika, cucumbers for every meal. 
And he gets the goose. 
- He's talking about me? 
Son, dad eats vegetables first and then meat. 
He got himself a meat first! 
- Give me some wine. 
My son passed the exam of maturity and we have to drink in that name. 
Petar! . 
Take the tankard, get in the wine cellar and you'll drink first! 
Hurry son, we have to go to visit grandpa in the hospital. 
Let him have some joy. 
Listen, Raka called from Belgrade. 
- And? 
Again about that thing. 
Our moving to Belgrade. 
We will think about it, for sure. 
Just, every smart man lives in a smaller place. 
It's healthier. 
- Sudents are in Belgrade. 
That's most important. 
And why that's most important? 
Because they're the only one who could make a change, if they rose up. 
And they will for sure. 
They've had enough. 
She means in France... 
- In France, really? 
- In Germany. 
And why she mentioned Belgrade? 
- She didn't, I did. 
I'm telling you about Raka. 
It will be good for Perica's studies. 
I waited for my father to find out that I didn't pass the exam and then to kill me. 
But instead of my punishment, in my life, so suddenly, walked in a new neighbour. 
Good afternoon. 
I am Olja Miranovski. 
We talked over the phone about the apartment. 
- Yes. 
Can I come in? 
- Of course. 
- Thank you. 
Olja Miranovski. 
Attention! 
From now on, in our town girl Orchestra from Czechoslovakia, 
Every night on Lido at 19 hours. 
Every sunday we were going to visit grandpa, who was in hospital cause of some unknown, but viscious and incurable disease. 
Grandpa. 
Wait a minute, Perica. 
Four queens. 
You skinned them? 
- Of course! 
Why they play if they don't know? 
Perica, is that true what they are talking about? 
- What? 
That some Czech girls arrived. 
What are they like? 
- Fine. 
Year' 22 in Brno, jambree. 
Those were the days. 
Good afternoon. 
Grandpa skinned them all in poker. 
- Of course! 
Dad, this is the hospital after all. 
I hardly persuaded a director to take you in, and you're acting like this! 
- These are my last days, and I won't deprive myself anything. 
- You won't, of course. 
Last days which last 20 years. 
What did you bring me? 
Why so little? 
Little? 
Here's roasted goose, carrot, potato. 
Sheep cheese. 
Aged? - Aged. 
- Then hoacake, pie and pancakes with walnuts. 
Dad, if I ate all of this I would die. 
Cowards die thousand times, and brave just once. 
Where are spices? 
Where's garlic? 
- Here with sour milk. 
And salt? 
Salt it's forbidden for you! 
Then all of this is for nothing! 
Take it! 
Dad, please, don't! 
It's forbidden. 
Don't! 
Please, let me eat and drink in peace. 
Cheers! 
- Cheers! 
Dad, Perica pass the exam. 
Son, tell him a details. 
- I know, I know. 
Rector of the highschool have told me. 
Congratulations, my boy! 
Don't worry, I failed three times. 
And diet grandpa? 
- Only for tonight. 
True. 
Maybe this is your last night. 
Good day, pleasent meal. 
- Good day. 
Dad, please hurry. 
It's going to rain. 
How did you came? 
Not on the bikes? 
- We did. 
You black sheep of the family! 
What are you doing? 
This is century of science, by yourself a car. 
If you need them, you buy them. 
Yes! 
When I needed them, I bought them. 
And not one but two. 
You have pictures at home. 
See how grandpa was driving. 
How, when father doesn't allow to see your pictures. 
Why? 
- There are always two or three ladies with you. 
Dear guests. 
I have the honour to present you, our guests from Czechoslovakia! 
Orchestra Palenky! 
That means dolls like you can see. 
I hope that you can understand now why I was telling you so much about my Czech semesters. 
Whole four years! 
Czech is right here! 
There was plenty to feel, see, smell, to taste... 
And you could find something for brave hands. 
Last night's incident in University campus in New Belgrade it's not just incident anymore. 
What it looked like just a rugged and hooligan ending of one well concieved night, today got a new form. 
Violent fightings that shook the University campus, were just a cause for a long student kolumn to start at noon their march from New Belgrade to the very downtown. 
Crowd of the distrubed students demostrants in their march, police have been stopped on the road near building of Federal Chamber. 
Soon after that dramatic events took place, and there was clash between the police and students. 
So far we know that there are injuries but there were no casualties. 
Where to? 
- Swimming. 
- Get back! 
You wanna get shock from temperature difference. 
First sit here in a shade for five minutes, both of you. 
Saska llic, apothecary. 
All aorund herself she spread a irresistible smell of essentialoils, hot summer and sunny sands. 
Put something under my head. 
And pour me some vine. 
I forgot it. 
- How did you forget it? 
We came to the beach without wine. 
- Less wine, less wine. 
- Silence! 
What do you think of? 
- If we had a car we could do it easily. 
Petar! 
Go get wine! 
Take a shortcut. 
Be here in 20 minutes. 
I'll measure the time. 
Go! 
Hi. 
What are you doing? 
- We're preparing attack on Czech. 
Join us, we're stronger togehter. 
I can't, I must go to get wine for my father. 
Good afternoon. 
- Good afternoon. 
You are Olja Miranovski, our new neighbour? 
How do you know? 
- I know. 
Petar Cvetkovic, student. 
What do you study? 
- Politics. 
I'm interested in marxism. 
And you? 
- I finished only school for library. 
I got spot in your city library. 
Can you show me way to the beach? 
- Of course. 
That's where I'm going. 
I'll show you. 
I don't have a bike. 
- Take mine. 
I will run, it's not hard for me. 
It's close. - No way. 
You just show me the way, I'll find it. 
It's not that close. 
Alright, then give me a ride. 
You drive well? 
- No problem. 
What she's saying? 
- Asking for a name. 
Him? 
Djoka. 
- Him. 
Pera. 
What is she doing? 
Reading newspapers. 
- Is that the way to read a newspaper? 
Vladica, come here! 
Perica, is not hard for you to blow this up? 
I will do it, just to bring wine to my father. 
Perica, only top button. 
Perica got a girlfriend. 
Perica got a girlfriend. 
What does he babbling about? 
What girlfriend? 
Big girlfriend. 
Brother got a girlfriend. 
You, who where you talking to overthere? 
What do you smell... 
Where were you mooching? 
You smell on perfume. 
- I just show her way to the beach. 
What do you have to show her a way? 
! 
How it can be that no one on the street, not one perfumed girl, ask me not you? 
- Don't hit me! 
Who're you talking to? 
Is he talking to me? 
- Of course. 
I don't understand why did you hit him. 
What did he do? 
See how he's talking to me. 
And you don't understand, right? 
! 
Who is the father here, me to him or him to me? 
These are the same ones that made riots in Germany and France. 
Their fathers feed them, and they're demostrating. 
A frog sees how big is the horse, so she wants to become one. 
It's not going to happen! 
- We're going too. 
- Where? 
To help demonstrators in Belgrade. 
There is Cile with students, they're preparing to go to Belgrade. 
Nobody will move from here! 
He is some student! 
? He's studying 100 years already! 
He's eating someone else's bread, and he wants to change my world! 
We came here on a fresh air, to swim and sunbath. 
That's it! 
Let's go on the sun. 
Dear visitors, temperature is rising, now it's 32 degrees Celzius. 
We wish you a pleasent dwelling on our Lido! 
Here are some more waltz. 
Right here! 
Lay down! 
Don't you look at those punks overthere. 
Cile is taking care of himself. 
And eats pie and yogurt. 
He agitates. 
- And everything he says it's true. 
Do you see what he's doing? 
How can I see when you told us to lay down? 
You, stand up. 
Bring me the pills. 
- For the stasis or apetite? 
You see I'm barely breathing. 
Why would I need for apetite? 
So for the stasis. 
My head is bursting. 
Less wine, less wine! 
Pardon judge. 
Can you spare me a moment? 
Excuse me madam. 
I haven't heard anything. 
- Yesterday in Belgrade. 
Students bariccaded in the faculties and won't come out. 
You know what paroles they were using? 
Down with social differencies! 
Down with red burogoisie! 
Down with the corruption and down with just one set of people in power! 
Come on, nonsense! 
I don't know nothing. 
You didn't say anything, I haven't heard anything. 
We're on the beach, for God's sake! 
- Alright but... 
- There's no but! 
We drudge, we're working here and we don't have time for that. 
Excuse me, but I still have something to say to you. 
My wife is complaining. 
- On students? 
No, no. 
On your son, Perica. 
- Excuse me? 
Perica is not a child anymore and he started to act, little indecent. 
How do you mean indecent? 
- Well, breathing down her neck. 
Breathing? 
- Yes. 
You see, everytime she go to shop, he is always there, behind her and always so close, so she can feel him. 
Like this... 
That's what I had to say to you. 
And I beg you to do something. 
- I will. 
Don't worry I will. 
And where is your wife so I can apologize? 
Here, if you please. 
I'm sorry, it will not happen again. 
- Let's hope so. 
Good afternoon. 
- How did you teach your son? 
It's always my fault. 
Excuse me, please. 
Highschool rector was looking for you. 
- What does he want? 
- I don't know. 
Pera is like our grandpa, so am I. 
Good day. 
- You probably heard. 
I haven't heard anything and I don't know anything. 
You have to know. 
Believe me, there's nothing I could do. 
We're friends, I respect you. 
Your father especially. 
But I couldn't do anything. 
About F's in geoography and history, I fixed that, but on matriculation exam your Perica didn't say a word. 
Not a word? 
You know professor of sociology? 
Take a look at her body. 
Look at those curves. 
You see, how can I say that, in that motherly curves, 
Perica was looking inproprietly, and he didn't say a word of the matter. 
Believe me, we had to plough him. 
Every member of comission was there, I couldn't do anything. 
I understand. 
Petar! 
My son to get F from marxsism! 
At this particular moment! 
And he's hiding that! 
He gave you his word... 
- What word? 
If he knows what honour is, he wouldn't allow the whole town to laugh at me! 
Son of county judge failed on matricular exam! 
I made a great sacrifice sou you can be able to be doctor, architect, engineer or judge some day! 
I don't want to be a judge. 
- What did you say? 
- Nothing. 
Answer my question, you hear. 
- I don't want to be a judge! 
- You won't? 
Pull down your pants! 
It seems like the war in Vietnam is reaching its climax these days, judging by American war operations and by bloody retaliation on innocent Vietnamese people. 
Pentagon is saying that right now, over the North Vietnam 8 American planes and 9 helicopters were destroyed. 
But Pentagon is keepenig the exact informations about how many pilots have been killed, saying just that, 
382 pilots and 289 other crew members died over South and North Vietnam. 
Saygon is saying that French goverment firmly refused wishes of South Vietnam for restitution of diplomatic relations. 
De Gaulle is constantly convicting American interferance in the war and demands that South Vietnam... 
You, stand up! 
Say good night to your father, mother, sister and brother. 
Why good night? 
It's day. 
- It's night for you. 
Very dark night. 
Understood? 
- Understood. 
Good night. 
Where are you going? 
- We're solidary. 
Excuse me? 
I didn't say anything. 
- You did, with your look. 
Like you don't know, in what state our society is today. 
Veso, what's wrong with you? 
No one can object you anything. 
You recently joined the Party, you're new. 
- Exactly! 
My son must have at least B in marxism! 
They forgot how to bring up children. 
Today it's coming back to them. 
Under my roof that would not be the case! Period! 
Petar! 
Petar! 
From tomorrow you must not pass by the drug-store. 
That's first. 
Second : 
Sign up into a library and read all about marxism. 
Clear? 
- Clear. 
What's clear? Repeat. 
- I can't pass by drug-store, to sign up into a library and to read all about marxism. 
That's right. 
That night I firmly decided to listen to my father. 
I would not pass by the drug-store, but I will sign up into library, for sure. 
And read everything about marxism. 
Olja Miranovski. 
Bring it! 
Come on! 
Bravo, dog, bravo! 
One more time, bring it! 
Come on, don't do it mechanically. 
Come on! 
Dog, doggy! 
Here you horse. 
Bring it here. 
Sit! 
Sit! 
Don't do it mechanically, you horse! 
Capital can be created in productive process before and it must be created in it, before learning... 
Capital can be created in productive process and it must be created in it, before learning to master its own extrems. 
You're learning, I see. 
Marxism, son. 
Marxism is not like the other matter, geography for example. 
You can live, even if you don't know, where is Abu Dhabi, Singapore, Singhal. 
Or from the history, when did king Milutin came to a throne. 
But marxism, you must simply know it. 
Do you understand? 
It will follow you your whole life. 
Marxism is pervading all the pores of our society. 
It's truly neccesary. 
Do you understand that? 
And you had to join the Party in your late ages to progress. I do. 
- Who said that? 
Who? 
That's not true, I didn't have to. 
I always wanted to join. 
I felt that so intimate and deep inside of me. 
There just were no conditons... 
You're investigate me? 
You want me to slap you behind your ear? 
Hoodlum! 
You have a big mouth, but don't know anything from the matter! 
Come on, say something from the book! 
Say it! - What to say? 
Veso! 
Phonecall! 
Read that from A to Z, from cover to cover. 
I will examine you. 
Who is it? 
- Belgrade. 
- Why me? 
What do I have to do with Belgrade? 
Hang up, that's some provocation. 
Buddy Raka. 
- And what if isn't Raka? 
Are you insane? 
Taking calls from Belgrade in moments like this. 
Hang up! 
We don't go to Belgrade. 
I have no attention of doing that. 
Raka about those hooks you were looking for. 
Hang up. 
Not a word! 
Hooks! 
They want to play with me. 
Hooks? 
You won't hooked me. 
They said on television last night, that public rallies are forbbiden in Belgrade. 
And you're goggle into TV? 
Goggle! 
And what did I say? 
Sealed until until further notice! 
Hello, Perica. 
What are you doing here? 
- I came to sign up. 
Nice. 
Come on. 
Plenty of meat. 
And I am a vegeterian. 
Enough! 
Turn it off! 
How many of this kind of movies you played in your restaurant? 
Five. 
Where did you get them from? 
- From Germany. 
Actually from Denmark. 
That's the best quality. 
You know that's forbbiden? 
- I didn't know. 
And customers don't mind at all. 
- Take him. 
This should be locked until the inquest. 
After the trial it should be burned infront of comission. 
What do you think, what fine he will get? 
- Maximum they can. 
Let's see what happened next. 
Dog! 
On the spot, dog! 
Sit! 
Bravo, dog! 
Summer. 
- Elusive. 
- What is elusive? 
You said summer. 
And it's really elusive. 
It's raining so often. 
Where is he? 
Did he go to the library? 
- Three times. 
Why three times? 
- First time, to sign up, second time, to pick up the books, and third, to pay for the membership. 
And now? 
- He went for the fourth time. 
- Why now? 
- To sign up Jova and Djoka. 
You see how it worked? 
Even an animal you can learn, and not one young hot head. 
You just need... 
- Hand of steel! 
Let's have lunch. 
You scared me. 
I feel that something is breathing down my neck. 
You want something? 
- Yes. 
You want some book? 
- No. 
What then? 
You. 
That's new generation! 
Everything without effort, without work, without knowledge. 
They just want to enjoy! 
And breath down women's necks. 
If we have a car, he would be at home more. 
He'd be doing something around engine. 
And everything would be fine. 
I will employ him at my friend Spasoje. 
He will be working hard. 
His back would be broke from the hard work! 
And what about the school? 
Let him finish that highschool. 
Let him learn what's working class. 
He'd be work by day, and learn by night. 
That's marxism in practice. 
- I'm not sure. 
Well, I am! 
Said-done. 
Turn it off! 
Here you are. 
Thank you very much. 
Good morning, buddy. 
- Hello, buddy. 
I brought my kid, like we agreed. 
Don't worry. 
He will be just fine. 
Come on kid! 
You know that Spasoje engaged? 
- Again? 
It's like he got right this time. 
I found her through some connections. 
Healthy, strong. 
Not like these girls today. 
And most important, virgin. 
My fiancee, your boss. 
Good afternoon. 
- Hello. 
Take off your pants. 
Why are you staring? 
Pants! 
You see that truck? 
Don't stop until you unload all that flower! 
Not much. 
Four and half tone. 
Her name was so simple, Jagodinka Simonovic. 
She smell like fresh pastry, salt pretzels and bake leaven. 
Go play outside, Vilkica. 
Why are you looking at me like that for two days now? 
You fell in love? 
- You're engaged. 
That's right. 
Pera, Perica! 
What? 
- Nothing. 
I just wanted to hear your voice. 
Where is your tie, dad? 
Even if it's hot like hell? 
- There must be an order in hell too. 
This is not some village but civilized town. 
We're not some village bakers I've learned my trade in Belgrade. 
In civilization there's a system. 
And inside that system are, you father, you brother and me. 
Order must come from our family, and not from some students. 
Jagodinka. 
- What is it? 
- Nothing. 
Just wanted to hear your voice. 
You just knead, it won't hurt you. 
Get out! 
What does it mean? 
- From now on you can watch television. 
Comrade Tito said, that students are right. 
Petar, hold this. 
Phone! 
Must be Raka. 
Daughter, tonight is quiz. 
Hello? 
Fine. Alright. 
You say, you're satisfied with work in a bakery? 
Do you hear your father? 
You see that he's on cloud nine. 
We're bothering you? 
What did you ask? 
How is it for you in a bakery? 
- Great. 
- Really? 
Really great? 
- I think so. 
And why did Spasoje called me then? 
Watch on that TV. 
I think it was about you. 
Why did he banish you from a bakery? 
That's' cause of that breasted baker woman. 
You raff! 
Hoodlum! 
I understand your age, puberty, but why her, friend's future wife? 
! 
You bastard! 
After the speech he made, president Tito is still receiving telegrams from all parts of our country. 
Till tonight president recieved over 600 letters and telegrams. 
Worker's collectives, social - politic organizations, students and citizens are honestly expressing their assent with Tito's words and they're saying that, like they were solidary in accepting social and economy reforms, they are solidary now to conduct those reforms until their goals. 
Telegrams and letters also confirmed, that workers are eagerly waiting decisions from the head of the Party promising that they will put maximum effort to to revive those ideas. 
In the most telegrams, that Tito received from the students, it's confirmed, that they are categorically insist on coherent realization of Tito's conception of our way into the socialism. 
Foreign agencies mainly did properly informed their publicity about reactions of Yugoslavian students on Tito's speech. 
While the situation still was tense last night, journalist of France Press is saying, just one speech that Tito made on TV, made all disappear. 
Almost all of students and professors of Belgrade University unanimously agreed that after one week strike they will continue their work on Monday or Tuesday, because chief of state, very simply explained them, what he intends to do for them and country. 
Similar informations are published by Reuters, 
Associated Press and other agencies. 
You decided? 
- I did. 
All of it? 
- All. 
Cile! 
What have you done? 
Nothing. 
I cut my hair. 
I'll never forget you. 
- Give me something to remember you. 
Give me your shirt. 
It has your smell. 
I had to come after my baker girl. 
I couldn't stand not a day, not an hour without her. 
Since she left, my heart was beating in the rhythm of her name. 
Crazy heart ceaselessly repeated : 
Jagodinka Simonovic, Jagodinka Simonovic, Jagodinka Simonovic... 
Dad, it's time for us to talk very seriously. 
For sixth time I'm prolonging your staying in the hospital. 
It's time to go back home. 
Here is real life. 
Here. 
Medical highschool is having practice here. 
Besides, maybe these are my last days. 
Dad. 
I cannot beg director of the hospital anymore. 
It's true that he's my friend, but you're going too far. 
You're healthy. 
- Me? - Sure. 
- And my back is hurting, my knees tremble, then bile, nerves? 
I am your father and it's your duty, to make director to do that. 
Besides you don't have to. 
I made him to play poker and he sucks. 
I will forgive him his debt if he doesn't threw me out. 
Chief of the hospital, 2 200 000. 
Highshool rector about 3 000 000. 
Highshool rector? 
- He also likes to play and he also sucks. 
I'll forgive him his debt if Perica passes the exam. 
What? 
You need money? 
Dad, I have big troubles. 
What is it? 
Talk. 
Perica is missing. 
What do you mean? 
- He fell in love with that Spasoje's fiancee and ran after her in Belgrade. 
I told Raka to find him. 
But nothing. 
I can't call the police, I would be ashamed. 
Him? 
Women? 
Petar! 
? 
That's my grandson! 
Where is he now so I can kiss him? 
That's not pedagogic. 
I scold him and you want to kiss him. 
How can I not kiss him? 
I was the same in his age! 
Dusko Mandic! 
Dusko! 
Just wanted to hear your voice! 
For unfortunate love and liberating death. 
Comrade, you're sitting on my wife's seat. 
I came after her, and she already have found some other clown. 
She forgot everything in two days. 
Tell him to stand up. 
- You see what state he's in? 
Tell him. 
- My wife doesn't have a place to seat. 
You have a ticket? 
-" L'amour est terrible." 
" La morte e bella." 
- Where is conducter? 
He's so sweet. 
Tadija! 
Czech are holding so well. 
That Dubichek is worth them like a gold. 
Dubchek. 
- How do you know? 
- I had a chance to exchange ideas with some philosophy students. 
Comrade judge, should we bring that band for wellcoming of president? 
Not a chance! 
We would be embareced. 
He's a gentleman, man of the world. 
Mila, check please! 
Let's go! 
You must be comrade Micic? 
- That's right. 
- Welcome. 
Wellcome? 
- A little county and patriarchal custom. 
It's suitable. 
After all, you're new president. 
I am Cvetkovic, local judge. 
My wife. 
I'm glad. 
- My daughter. 
My wife. 
And my younger son. 
That's my wife and my daughters. 
- What was your trip like? 
- Awful! 
Good at the start, but then some drunk noddy came in and started to vomit in the car. 
That's the youth of today. 
Please, car is waiting. 
- Thank you. 
Thanks collegue. 
I didn't expect something like this. 
If you need something, don't hesitate to ask. 
Take a look. 
Pittyful is the father that has a son like this. 
Sorry and pittyful. 
There was a meeting today betweeen Communist Party of SSSR and Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. 
As Agency Tass is saying meeting was full of total honesty, openess and mutual understanding and it was objected to develop more stronger of traditionally friendly relations of between Parties of two nations founded on the principals marxism, Leninism and proleterian internationalism. 
Both delegations... 
Why do we brush our teeth now? 
- Guests are coming. 
And what are we going to do to them? 
- Shut up and brush like crazy! 
For that embarassment, you will get detention. 
Dad, it's not a medeival. 
- Shut up you bastard. 
President of the court mustn't find out, that you were that raff from the train. 
Man who can't educate his own son, can't and mustn't be a judge! 
Veso! 
- I'm coming! 
And don't make a sound! 
Your roses are wonderful. 
- That's my work. 
Yes, your work. 
And who's watering them? 
You're watering them, but I give them a soul. 
Please, let me show you. 
I interbreed them, graft them. 
I know their every particular need. 
You see, this is Elvira, there is Simonida, then Teodora. 
And what's the lady's name? 
- Leposava. 
- Leposava. 
Here! 
This would be Leposava. 
Please, madam. 
Let me show you our house. 
Our local bicycle union is organizing duck hunting. 
I don't know why people are rushing so much. 
You know how many cars there is? 105 000. 
- And you're not for cars? 
While I'm live we're not going to buy that. 
This is old family vineyard. 
- Congratulations. 
You know what you live for. 
In this house we're drinking only top class drinks. 
Can we try that? - Of course. 
I have something special for us. 
Good old fashion of living. 
Peaceful, quiet, calm... 
I always say to my husband, that something like this has to exist somewhere. 
What are you doing here? 
- We're in a visit. 
You're so sweet! 
Let my sister go. 
It's two of us, we're stronger. 
Just go ahead. 
I haven't be scared of stronger than you. 
This wine is from 1928. 
Famous vintage. 
There's only this bottle left. 
Here you are. 
- Thank you. 
You're lucky. 
Home, family, peace, stability. 
Eh my collegue... 
I'm sorry. 
- Something's wrong with the wine? 
- No. 
What can be wrong here? 
This is paradise! 
I remembered my pain. 
It's not right, but still, even if we see each other for the first time, I'll relieve you my soul. 
Feel free. 
If I can help you with something. Go ahed. 
It's about my children. 
- Excuse me? 
- I practically run away here. 
To pluck them off from bad company. 
You're lucky to have such kids. 
Me? 
- You don't know what kind of troubles I had. 
Comrade president... 
- Don't comfot me, I haven't told you everything. 
I'm sorry, you're wonderful man. 
I have to complain to someone. 
And who can I complain to? 
- You didn't had problems. 
Tadija and Vladica are angels. 
- Now I will show you. 
Hand of steel is the cure. 
He's tide up. 
- Who? - My ex problem. 
My oldest son. 
Come on. 
Petar! 
I will kill you! 
I will kill him. 
I will kill you, Petar! 
Here are the photos that reminding us on those days, when the struggle for the foundations of the first sky-scrapers began. 
The most important thing at the start was to take the land from the river and swamp. 
On 800 hectare came 21 millions cubic of sands. 
All that work without help of engines, using only pickaxe and shovel. 
For two decades 20000 apartments was finished. 
There are schools, health centers, cinemas, shops, everything that 100 000 citizens need. 
So that's in a few words, yesterday, today and tomorrow of a New Belgrade. 
And that tomorow is beeing made by the hands of young workers. 
Dear viewers, good bye. 
Daddy. 
- Sorry my darling. 
I'm pensive. 
You don't know, Vladica, the troubles I'm in. 
If you didn't get the good grades, I wouldn't know what to do... 
Daddy, I want to read you something from my diary. 
Read it. 
After everything that happened, this turbulent and decisive year 1968. 
is promising that in the near future we're going to fulfil all our awakened hopes. 
Fully employment will be achived, we will not owe anyone, social differences will almost not exist, and our whole country will be flowered and beautifuly arangged garden, united community of nations and ethnic groups. 
What dead line to make for this? 
Five or six years? 
Daddy, you're crying. 
- I'm happy, my daughter. 
Happy, beacuse you pervade, feel, you know things. 
You, 15 years old, know more than that idiot of mine in his 18. 
First son! 
Come on, daddy. 
He'll pass the exam. 
Trust me. 
He promised me. 
- I don't know, my daughter. 
Maybe this year of' 68 is good for a mankind but for me it's a disaster. 
Here come grandpa with Czech girls. 
- What grandpa? 
You're all insane! 
Vladica, please, go stop him! 
No, no. 
I will go! 
Your grandson is passing the exam and you're in a parade with those Czechs. 
This is too much. 
I came out to have some joy. 
This may be the last night of my life. 
That would be 1000th jubilant. 
- My darling. 
Everyone has to die sometime. 
We're all of flesh and blood. 
I will die first. 
- You won't. 
- I will. - No. 
Go and see if Petar is coming.. 
And I failed three times. 
So what then? 
I was best geometar in the whole county. 
You're still using my cadastres. 
And I spent 8 years filling and rearranging what you wrote. 
- You are my son. 
You had to make some contribution in life. 
Brother is coming! 
Brother is coming! 
Brother is coming! 
Brother is coming! 
- He's coming? 
But he hanged his nose down. 
- Hanged his nose down? 
Clear! 
He failed! 
Petar, grandpa's pride! 
Congratulations! 
- He's congrulating him. 
So, brother? 
- I passed. 
- Passed, of course! 
Mama, he passed the exam! 
- He passed beside my grave! 
Die, Veselin Cvetkovic! 
Die! 
My son! 
You passed. 
- He passed? 
I will remember this day, 20 of August, until I die. 
Your highschool rector's debt is now gone. 
And now, the two of us will merry until the dusk. 
This is your first big night. 
Your first big night. 
And maybe my last. 
Pera, Pera stop. 
Petar, how it's wonderful to live! 
I'm fed up with hospital, wheelchairs, spoons... 
My legs and my heat are still good. 
I want to live Petar! 
Grandpa! 
Look Petar, carp! 
Here you are, your carp. 
One litar of white wine. 
- Grandpa! 
- Grandpa's pride! 
Rumpus salad, sliced sheep cheese, chilli pappers. 
To remind ourselves of everything we used to love. 
Right away Mr. Cvetkovic. 
This is my older brother. 
Dance, Petar, make me proud. 
Ruzenka. 
- Petar. 
We must bring him back to life. 
A long time ago I was study in Prague with good soldier Svejk. 
Dance, Petar. 
Eh, how did we randan in my time! 
In Prague, on the Karlo's Bridge. 
Petrchek, wake up. 
Live. 
- No, I want to die. 
This may be the last night of my life. 
You're dancing with a dead man. 
Last salute. 
You only live once, Petar, remember that. 
Only once! 
If I could only live for another 10 years! 
And then I would retire. 
My blood. 
This is my tree. 
I call it a tree of life. 
How do you say tree? Tree? 
- Vrba. ( Willow ) 
It is a willow. 
I come here when something significant happened in my life. 
First grade, end of elementary school, first year of highschool, scarlet fever, grandma's death. 
I wanted to hang myself here once. 
Would you come one time in Prague? 
One time! 
Hundred times! 
That morning, like I premonited, finally I have found a woman of my life, 
Ruzenka Hrabalova. 
I've decided to give my Ruzenka, the most beautiful bouqet of roses from a father's garden. 
Simonida. 
Emilia. 
Leposava. 
Armed forces of SSSR, Democratic Republic of Germany, 
Poland, Hungaria and Bulgaria, in the night between Tuesday and Wednesday, ocuppied the whole territory of Czechoslovakia.. 
During the night Radio Prague announced that, forces of 5 states of Warsaw Pact are entering from all around on Czechosolovakian ground. 
Radio appealed on citizens to maintain peace and order. 
When did they gone? 
- Just now. 
That's how started and ended my first and great love that long gone year of 1968. 
I haven't seen Ruzenka Hrabalova ever again. 
AT THE END OF THE 14TH CENTURY 
TURKS FROM ASIA MINOR STARTED TO CONQUER EUROPE. 
THE SERBIAN MEDIEVAL STATE RESISTED THIS INVASION. 
THE BATTLE OF KOSOVO 
Based on the novel of Ljubomir Simovic 
Prince Lazar Milos Zutic 
Princess Milica Gorica Popovic 
Vuk Brankovic Vojislav Brajovic 
Miloc Obilic Zarko Lausevic 
Big Danube fish! Sterlets! 
Pike perches! 
Directed by Zdravko Sotra 
Hey, monk! 
Does this path lead to Kosovo? And that one too and the one from which you came. - Yes. 
What are you wondering? 
Every path leads there. 
There is no other path today in Serbia then the one leading to Kosovo or from Kosovo. 
In the time of prince Dusan, Serbia was reflecting in the water of 3 seas. 
After his death it shrunk to 3 river alleys. 
From the 3 seas we have only Pomoravje left and Murat wants that as well 
It would be best, if we could tear up this Murat letter and forget about it. 
- No, Spiridon. 
This letter isn't our only problem. 
The best thing would be if we were unanimous. 
Then we wouldn't fear Murat, Murat would fear us. 
If we were unanimous, the sultan wouldn't dare demand from us that we were obedient, give him the army and pay for the haradj. 
You can't demand this from a state, a country can't accept this. 
Did you decline his demands? 
- What else would I do? 
Did Murat get your answer already? 
- Yes. 
And he's responding. 
The Turkish army already broke into the territory of 
Vuk Brankovic and headed towards Lab in Sitnica. 
To Kosovo. 
- To Kosovo. 
The armies will clash on Kosovo at Vid's day. 
Is Murat coming with a large army? 
They say it's so big, you can hear it from 2 hours of walk away. 
Toplica and Kosancic will inform us about the army strength. 
Who do you count on Lazar? 
Our son-in-law Vuk Brankovic is with us. 
You're gonna fight a pack of lions with one wolf? 
Where is our other son-in-law? 
Where is Djuradj II Balsic, the master of Zeta and Pomoravje? 
Will Djuradj come? 
You know that because of Trebinje, Konavlja and god knows what else, he's in conflict with Bosnia. 
He attacked Bosnia together with the Turks. How could he defend Serbia from the Turks? 
Will at least king Tvrtko I. Kotromanic come? 
He sent the detachment under the command of duke Vlatko Vukovic. 
He's sending a duke instead of coming himself. 
Why did he crown himself with the Nemanjici crown, if he doesn't have time to defend the Serbs? 
Trouts, eels, big Danube fish! 
Carps, pikes, sheatfish! 
Trouts, sheatfish, pike perches! 
Fresh Danube fish! 
Kosovo, Kosovo! 
All you talk about is Kosovo. 
They say our destiny is at stake on Kosovo. 
It's Kosovo for me each day. 
Why are they so afraid of the Turks? 
They're not grasshoppers. 
- They're the cruelest army. 
They steal wool, cloth, cattle. They burn down houses. 
They burn down clouds. 
Supposedly they don't eat pork. 
- They rape girls and boys. 
They turn churches into stables and mosques. 
Do they eat fish? 
- They impale people alive. 
Are you deaf? 
Do they eat fish? 
- What? 
- Do Turks eat fish? 
I think so. 
Why do you ask? 
- Why do I ask? 
Trouts, eels, carps, sterlets! 
Fresh Danube fish! 
When you sent Murat the responding letter, you surely took thought before replying. 
- You think I don't know what I have? 
I know I'm not Emperor Dusan the Mighty. 
We have nowhere to run. 
We must defend what we have left. 
Look how divided Serbia is and what Serbian magnates are doing. 
To preserve power, they would rather turn Turks then attack them with you. 
Who will you gather when everything is falling to pieces? 
Everyone would like to be some kind of king and crown their empty head. 
Even as small as a thimble as long as it's a crown. 
As small as it is, as long as it's a kingdom. 
Every village is a capital, every cottage a palace. 
Murat isn't coming with such an army to negotiate. 
He wants more then he said. 
Even if he made an agreement with me, the army would rip him to pieces if he wanted to send it back home without a fight and prey. 
I have nothing left to do then gather as much strength as I have left. 
I will gather the army, you assemble the metropolitans and vladikas, archimandrites, monks, priests and deacons from all the churches and cloisters from all over Serbia, so they give communion to our army before the battle. 
This will be our great suffering. 
- I know. 
We will suffer one way or the other. 
But we can choose. 
Either we die crawling like Turkish slaves or turned Turks or we die honorably. 
There is no other alternative. 
- Better to be remembered by our grandchildren as dead then be forgotten while still alive. 
Of all the black clouds above Serbia this one is neither the first nor the blackest. 
There is no time. 
I'll go to Mojsinje since it's closer. 
I'll send the messages to the monks from there. 
We'll reach Kosovo in time. 
- Are you coming? 
I also want to earn my divine grace. 
May God be with you. 
May God bestow us with his mercy not only with the suffering but also with a victory in Kosovo. 
God bless you. 
Find me a fat carp. 
Will this one do? 
- Hit him on the head with a mallet. 
This one would be an ornament even on a princely table. 
- Tonight it will be an ornament on mine. 
If I have to die tomorrow like a dog 
I'll be at least eating today as prince. 
Are you going to Kosovo too? 
- This calamity concerns us all. 
They really must be in trouble if they're calling for you. 
- Oh, yeah. Like never before. 
- There were wars and battles, but nothing like this. 
All the blacksmith's workshops and smelteries are working. 
Yesterday an iron wheel broke, today a silver one snapped. - Where? 
- In the mine. 
Because of overweight. 
- They have to forge so many swords, there won't be a spoonful of iron left. 
Nobody ask themselves who pays for all those swords. 
It's common knowledge. The prince. 
- I'm paying. 
You're supplying his army? 
- Tomorrow on Kosovo we'll be paying with lives. - Of course. 
What kind of D is this? 
Even a literate person wouldn't know if it's a D or A. 
Mr. Vuk Brankovic... 
- Am I intruding? 
No. We have finished. 
Until I order otherwise no one should see these dinars. 
Not even for the price of a life. 
They won't be put in circulation for now. 
Dinars with moulds are locked up in 7 iron boxes, and those are in the chest of your treasury. 
The keys are... 
You should shut your moth. 
I know where they're locked. 
Get lost. 
Are you coining new dinars? 
The summer has only started and it's already hot at night. 
Kosovo will obviously cost you dear. 
- More then that. 
Equipping such an army with men at arm, horses and infantrymen can nowadays reduce a country to poverty. 
As always it's my concern. 
What concern brought you? 
I have come to warn you to support Lazar with everything you have got. 
- Why should I support him? 
Because Serbia never was in bigger danger then today. 
And with her all the Christian world, not just the Orthodox. 
Lazar is the only one that can save Serbia and Christianity. 
So Krusevac doesn't become the new Constantinople. 
You can see Cviljan and Kaljaja from your window and Jerusalem from his. 
You talk as though you were Lazar's brother and not my own. 
You think there is no other head then Lazar's, no other way for the existence of Serbia, except Lazar's way? 
Among the weak magnates, only Lazar is the one with the vision. 
I have no vision? 
What vision do you have? 
This room measures 6 x 10 meters. 
That pine tree is 30 meters high. 
This barrel can carry 200 liters. 
This bull weighs 700 kg. 
The bell strikes 4 times at 4 o'clock, and 7 times at 7 o'clock. 
That is my vision. 
The snake is poisonous, the peach is sweet and wormwood is bitter. 
Serbs are few, Turks are many. 
Why are you looking at me? 
- You call that a vision? 
What vision does Lazar have? 
- Vision of Serbia. 
And Serbian unity. 
He's smart enough to know that he could hardly unite the Serbs, if he wanted to subordinate all the Serbian magnates and proclaim himself as the Tsar, as many wanted. 
I most certainly didn't. 
Who chose Kosovo as the battlefield? 
You or Murat? 
Neither Murat or me. 
Kosovo chose itself. 
Can it be seen from here? 
No, but one knows where it is. 
- Where? 
You see that splendor in the sky? 
- I see. 
Kosovo is directly underneath it. 
That's dusk. 
What's your name, you say? 
- Makarij. 
Brother Makarij? 
- That's right. 
Did you paint all those Lazar's churches? 
- Almost all of them. 
I was returning from St.Petka to Vojnovica when they told me that the patriarch is in Mojsinje and is assembling all the clergy in Kosovo so that the army gets its communion before the battle. 
How do you find the way? 
- The eyes aren't the only sense of sight. 
Without my eyes with these old hands I can see how April dawn is changing to July evening and November dusk. 
Father Teofan, we are lost. 
I don't know anymore from where we came and where we're heading. 
- Let's follow this way. 
You blind man will show me the way? 
- The fog is troubling you because you see it and I don't see it so it doesn't bother me. 
Are you coming or not? 
Guards! 
Does this path lead to Kosovo? - Why are you asking? 
Will you fight too? 
You don't look like a knight nor a solider. 
I'm not a soldier. I'm a medicus, et chirurgico et barberius de Prezarin. 
- What are you? 
- Doctor, surgeon and barber from Prizren. 
- How come you don't know the path to Kosovo? 
I know the way from Prizren, now I'm coming from Resava. 
What are you doing in Kosovo if you're not a soldier? 
- What am I doing? 
You know how many punctured liver, lungs, scattered guts and brains, broken hands and feet, broken ribs, crushed skulls, broken fingers and spines, dug out eyes and broken bones, shot through throats and jaws will there be in Kosovo? 
There will be enough blood to sail on it with boats. 
Is anyone paying you to talk this way? 
- Do you think that the Turks will welcome us with pilaf and baklavas? 
Anyone who hears your stories will never go to Kosovo. 
What you do have in the bags? 
- Books and medicine. 
What kind of books? 
- Medical. Instructions for healing wounds. 
- And this? 
Empty it. 
These are medicines and balsams. 
Don't shake it, you'll break everything. 
Who will pick this up? 
- Look, you fart. 
I use it to wash my ears. 
I put the nib for the tube over here and extract the liquid from the ears. 
- What do you have in this bag? 
- Cheese 
Open it. 
Close it. 
He has a mortar. 
- To rub medicine in. 
Are these medical books too? 
- No, those are for prophecy. 
Can you predict what will happen in Kosovo from these books? 
You can see that without the books. 
- What can you see? 
When everyone takes something from Serbia, the kingdom, dukedom, princedom, tyrantdom, and sums up all the taken we all end up with nothing. 
- Tie him up. 
What are you doing? 
You are neither the first nor the last Turkish spy that we have caught. 
I'm not a spy. I'm a medicine man. 
Obilic, God himself has sent you! 
- Why did you tie him up? 
Because he's a Turkish spy, sir. 
- How do you know that? 
He says that Turks will chop off our heads in Kosovo. 
Won't they? 
He says that the Serbian empire has fallen in ruins. 
- Hasn't it? 
He says that the magnates are responsible for it. 
You're raising unpleasant sub questions, sir. 
His only crimes is that he sees that the empire has fallen, he knows why it has fallen, because of who it has fallen and is crazy enough to say it loud. 
Master do you remember the battle at Plocnik, when prince Lazar defeated Murat? 
- Is that you? 
- It's me. 
- A doctor? 
- From Prizren. 
He healed my wound over there. 
Untie him. 
We will when we get the order from our master Vuk Brankovic, the master of Kosovo. 
- My respect to Vuk Brankovic. 
If you have unsheathed the sword, use it to cut the rope. 
Be careful not to cut him. 
Now sheathe the sword. 
The rope was too tight. 
An idiot is just an idiot. 
Are you talking about me? 
- You better leave your sword put! 
Be careful with that iron ware of yours. 
Obilic is an excellent swordsman. 
I'll feed you alright, with wooden pears. 
How much would Lazar's vision be worth in Kosovo tomorrow without my army? 
- Lazar also has a large army. 
Larger then anyone else in Serbia could assemble. 
It is large, but it isn't sufficient enough. 
You can say that it has Obilic, the hero of all heroes. 
He likes him too much. 
- There is a reason Obilic has such a good reputation. 
Is that the reason you came from Atos, so you can throw Obilic at me? 
You mentioned him, not me. 
You jump when his name is mentioned. 
What do you hold against Obilic? 
What harm has he done you? 
Why are you so opposed to him? 
Is everyone asking you what will happen in Kosovo? 
Only fools don't see what will happen. 
- And you see it? 
Wolf and dog snouts are snapping at the people, and the people don't know where to go. 
You know what kind of a herd the Serbian people are? If it takes seven sheep to pasture, it will lose eight of them. 
- What do you know about Serbian people and Serbian shepherds? 
- I just know that Serbia is doomed with shepherds like that. 
A raven with a rat could rule Serbia from a thatch. 
My dear Bogoj, you have been reading unwritten books and forgot about the written ones. 
You could have read in these books that the twice baptized great Serbian mayor Stevan Nemanja was also a shepherd. 
And his son Stefan the first-crowned and St. Sava. 
And Stefan Uros II, king Milutin, Stefan Dusan the Mighty, 
Serbian Tsar. 
You could have seen and read, that these shepherds didn't lose their sheep. 
The Serbian people with them weren't a flock of sheep bleatingly going to the slaughterhouse. 
Even lions retreated from them. 
With that in your mind you could see what will happen. 
What will happen, is that even today a shepherd will be found in Kosovo before whom those will retreat that haven't retreated from no one else before. 
Even Mura and his son, that degenerate of a dog. 
And a sun will, even if after a hundred of years, chase away the ravens and the rats and it will warm up and shine on Serbia. 
If we strike it today. 
Master. 
What is it? 
Why are you bothering me? 
- He has to speak with you. 
What is this now? 
Is this a village crossing or a palace? 
I have urgent and important news. 
- Gerasim, wait for me. Something happened. 
Let the bartender pour you a cup of wine. 
White or red? 
- Red, half a cup. 
What is this guard's name? 
- This is the commander of Vuk's sentry. 
Paramunac. 
He has his net spread all over Serbia. 
You shouldn't have tried because of me. 
One doesn't know here, what someone thinks and what someone is preparing because of something. 
Leave Turks and Kosovo. Leave them alone and find a doctor. 
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. 
- I want to know where he was, whom he met and what he did. - Ok. 
- Wait. 
Buy yourself some wine. You've deserved it. 
- On command. 
I didn't know this doctor was so important to you. 
I don't understand something. 
If you're coining money for the battle as you say why don't you allow it to go in circulation? 
Why are you locking it up, when you need it most? 
Why can't anyone see it? Not even for the price of a life. 
And what is of more importance to you today then Kosovo? 
What does your silver money mean? 
Is it the sun, setting for Lazar and rising for Vuk? 
Too many questions at once. 
I'm looking at the cloud above Kopaonik. 
It's so big and black as though Judgment Day is coming. 
- We live between two frontiers. 
One is dropping deep into the clothy darkness, the other is rising to the silky light. 
The upper glaring frontier is constantly avoiding us, the lower one is following us and lurking. 
I thought you knew this frontier. 
- I hear that for the first time. 
When one trespasses this frontier, you start to grow feathers or scales, a shepherd becomes a sheep, fisherman a fish, people turn into mice, bugs or snakes. 
You see that frontier? - I see it. 
- Do you see over it? 
I wish I didn't. 
Could you teach me to look over that frontier? 
Could you teach me? 
You wouldn't want that once you heard the price for it. 
What is it? 
- Cross yourself. 
The price is your eyesight. 
Shut up. Don't bring bad luck. 
- He won't return from Kosovo alive. Shut up. 
He'll return. 
- Drink a bit of water. 
what river will be your fiancee 
- He doesn't want a drop of water. 
You should thank God you're not saying farewell to your son or brother. 
What is wrong with her? 
- Her fiancee went to Kosovo. 
And hence such sorrow? 
- Even you would long for Milan Toplica. 
He went to spy in the Turkish camp. 
- I accompanied to Kosovo my father, son, both husbands and four brothers and all my uncles and cousins, yet I am still alive and am not moaning. 
And she's making such a fuss because of her fiancee. 
Then I should die from sadness. 
- You have no idea how she suffers.. 
She'll forget him soon. 
Some gold and five reels of thread will do it. 
Why did Lazar assemble us? - The last consultation before the battle. 
I fear this battle will cost us dearly. 
I would have something to say about that. 
- All has already been said. 
It's too late for words. 
Words have become an army. 
Since when does his authority reach into our lands? Why should Lazar decide in the name of all of us? 
- Who is he to decide in my own land? 
He was given power with the resolution of the parliament. 
And the Church supports him. 
- Because the patriarch is Lazar's man. 
Lazar bribes him by building churches all over Pomoravje. 
Hey, soldier! 
Is this the way to Kosovo? 
Then I am lost. 
- No. 
You have arrived. 
- Is this Kosovo? 
You're loaded as a Dubrovnik caravan. 
Do you have silk and spices? 
- No, balsams and medicines. 
Is something bothering you as well? 
- Something has been bothering me, for a longer time 
But it can be cured with a bowl of lentils. 
Why didn't you say before? 
Here, take it, eat. 
- What is this? Cheese. 
Just eat. 
How come it's hairy? 
- Because I have been carrying it in a bag made of goat skin. 
It looks more like a badger then cheese. 
- Then leave it if you don't want it. 
Why are you constantly looking back? 
Why would I? 
Why do you have the hairy side turned inside instead out outside? 
You're not hungry. 
- Of course I am. 
- Shut up. 
What is it? 
- Keep silent! 
We musn't tell prince Lazar about this 
- Why not? 
If we tell him what we saw in the Turkish camp, he might get scared, have his doubts and give up on the battle. 
If he gave up on the battle, if he surrendered in and submitted, what would be of Serbia when Asia flood her without any resistance? 
And what do you think we should tell him? 
- We wont tell him that we saw janissaries, we'll tell him we saw ripplers and sieve makers. 
Instead of cavalry we'll mention combers, saddlers and leather merchants. 
We'll tell him the truth. 
If you insist on that the prince's dinner will go down the wrong way. 
Better then our breakfast going down the wrong way tomorrow. 
Hurry up. 
Why are we hiding from our own people? 
- If she saw us, she wouldn't tell how large of an army is in Kosovo. 
I saw her even without them. 
If Serbia was on balance with Kosovo, it would rise high in the air, and Kosovo would sink. 
That big is the army in Kosovo. I've been sitting here for 2 days and watching. 
If only the wind didn't blow from the Turkish side. 
I'm feeling sick from all the suet smell. 
Even the basilica smells of it. 
That's because the Turks prepare everything with suet. 
Baklava's, pilaf, pies. Even candles. 
- At least I don't eat candles. 
Serbia is ruled by the priests, not Lazar. 
It's full of black frocks. 
Be careful what you say. - Only the prince could silence me not his nephew. 
- If your father didn't teach you order, this sword would teach you, if we weren't here. 
Are we gonna fight against the Turks or are fighting among ourselves? 
I didn't come to negotiate with the prince's nephews, 
I have come to see this man, that signs himself as Christ Lord sovereign of Serbia, 
Stefan, prince Lazar, to put some sense into his head. 
Let him withdraw the army from Kosovo, let him not fight but negotiate. 
You can negotiate about the head, but not the honour. 
I know why you don't want to go to battle. 
You think your lands are far away from Kosovo. 
But Kosovo will be in your lands tomorrow. 
People stronger then you have acknowledged Turkish authority. - Who are you? 
King Marko, despot Dejanovic. 
- Stronger, you say. 
And what have they done with this authority? 
Did they return the Altamanovic lands or did I? 
Who turned the defeated and divided Serbia into a principality which will, if God gives, become an empire again? 
When everyone was squandering, who was gathering? 
Marko, Konstantin or Lazar? 
- They have avoided the bloodshed preserved the land and the people. 
- They preserved their crowns. 
At least they think so. 
When your farmers will be leaving bones in Kosovo with you their's will be peacefully harvesting wheat. 
- So they pay the Turks for the haradj. 
So they will starve in peace. 
We must defend ourselves from such peace. 
Don't talk to me about farmers. 
You don't care about the farmers not about Serbia. 
You don't care if your lands will be tomorrow under Hungary or under Turkey. 
All you care about is that you have a crown on your head, gold in your purse and cloth in the chests. 
- That's not true. 
The truth will be proven in Kosovo, not here. 
Did you come to fight or talk? 
- We have come to talk about whether it is worth fighting for. 
- It's not about whether we want to fight, it's about our existence. 
Does existence to you mean bowing to Murat's servants, cooks and ostlers and kissing Murat's shoe? 
The Turkish might is too big. 
- Your fear is too big. 
Shall we let fear destroy everything we have achieved? 
If we don't rise in the air like hawks over the Turks today, we will have chickens cackling in the palace tomorrow. 
You were long among the Turks. 
- Longer then we expected. 
What have you to say? 
- Unfortunately nothing good. 
The Turkish army is all over Kosovo. 
With one wing they're holding Lab, with the other Sitnica. 
They even have a tent-city with streets, workshops and stores. 
There's at least twice as many of them as us. 
You aren't exaggerating? 
- There's 50.000 of Janissaries. 
30.000 lancers, 60.000 infantrymen, 20.000 troopers. 
- There are only 70.000 Serbs. 
If only we got the promised balisters and bombards. 
The army is big but it's assembled from all kinds of places. 
Quantity instead of strength. Idlers, not soldiers. 
I wouldn't say they are idlers, nor that they would be from all kinds of places. 
The Turkish army is well selected, skillful, well armed and excellently paid. 
Your reports are different. 
One says white the other black. 
Does one want to make me happy or the other scare me? 
- So you would retreat before the Turkish might and return to your peaceful lands? 
I know he wave to attack the Turks but not blindly. 
The Sultan brought the armies from Rumelia and Anatolia, his sons Jakub and Bajazit and his best generals. 
It is not a usual battle for them. 
- And it is for us? 
For them it's a holy war. 
- Isn't it for us as well? 
Anything else important? 
- Yes, noble prince. 
The Turkish army has Serbs and Greeks from Epir and Tesalia. 
There is a very influential Serb in Murat's court. - Hamza? 
Turkish vassals but Christian soldiers and knights. 
Fear the Christian sword more then the Turkish sabre. 
We heard the report from Kosovo. 
The Turks are as they are. 
Let's see how we stand. 
- If it's true as Kosancic says, that there's twice as many of Turks then us... 
Whether or not I go to battle doesn't depend on the strength of the enemy but based on the sacred thing that I defend. 
Hey, are you sleeping? 
- No, I'm dreaming. 
I sat on the beach of Morava. 
- And what were you doing? 
I was watching ships loaded with fish and watermelons. 
- Will you have some cheese? 
This cheese of yours is more hairy then a bear. 
As though he was eating me. 
- As you wish. 
How do you distinguish them? - What? 
- The cheese and fur coat. 
Do you ever wear the cheese and have fur coat for dinner? 
You will wake me at night when you won't be able to sleep because of hunger. 
You get fever and hallucinations from hunger. 
Sit down, gentlemen. 
Tonight the table is monastic not princely. 
There is no boar-meat, hare's meat, venison and chamois meat. 
Not because we wouldn't have good hunters and cooks, but because we have to say hungry and sober. 
This is more of a Holy Communion then a dinner. 
We will eat what Christ ate, because tomorrow we are Christ's soldiers. 
Gentlemen, let's pray. 
Let us have nothing else then a grain of salt but let everything be salted with it. 
When water and fire take everything from us, let that grain be our everything. 
Amen. 
- Amen. 
I raise my first cup to the soldiers, the first toast to the first of them. 
If I had another Obilic in the army I would sleep even peacefully. 
I want to make a toast too, prince. 
But I would like to start with the last one. 
If you recognize the first one in him, my toast does not disprove yours. 
Let me please, the first to make a toast contrary to the usual custom. 
What does this mean? 
- In Kosovo there won't be just two countries, two nations and two rulers fighting but two continents, two religions, two Gods. 
This will be your battle. 
The one that betrays you is sitting tonight behind your table. 
Obilic, Vuk is looking at you. 
- You're just imagining it. 
I hope you're not joking. 
- I'm obliged to say that I see among those that have come on horseback to Kosovo with us those that eat with us, drink and talk with us, 
tomorrow they will rise their sabre against us. 
Obilic, Vuk is looking at you. 
- Why would he be looking at me? 
If your son-in-law is converting, my new brother-in-law, and so many of Serbian gentlemen, why wouldn't some of your best soldiers? 
Levcanin? - What? 
- Don't do you think that Vuk is looking at me? 
Should he be? 
Did Judas come to Kosovo to earn his silver coins? 
He's not asking me. 
- I ask myself. 
I ask myself, how do we survive without... 
- Without what? 
If we have no grain, I don't know what else that wouldn't melt or change nor in the river nor in the sea nor in the poison nor in the blood. 
Which will also stay in heaven what it was in hell. 
Olive tree, vine, wheat, everything would spring up from this grain, if we had it. 
- Those that don't have the grain don't have anything. 
Some people would give their lives for it others would give away this holy grain... 
For pearly grain? 
Or for Judas silver coins? 
Or for a bowl of Murat's pilaf? 
Vuk Brankovic! 
You will swallow this pilaf. 
I'll use my sword to press it into your lying mouth. 
Don't draw the sword behind my table. 
Do you allow your sons-in-law to accuse honest people without any evidence? 
You have accused the best among us using such words that you'll have to answer with your head for each of them. 
I'm not afraid of any pledge. 
- I need evidence. 
My guards have caught a Turkish spy between Toplico and Lab. 
He was scaring the soldiers saying that the Turks would chop off their heads. 
The guards tied him up when Milos Obilic appeared. 
To cut a long story short. 
As the guards have stated Obilic confirmed everything that the spy talked about. 
He said that the Serbian has disintegrated that the fight against the Turks is hopeless and lost in advance. 
Then he attacked the guards with his sword and freed the spy. 
He wanted to kill the guards. 
- He's not a Turkish spy, he's a Serbian medicine man. 
In the battle at Plocnik he took care of my wound. 
- Obilic wants to remind you that he was wounded in battle. 
For that he expects you to pay. 
- You can't believe one single word more then all of Obilic's battles. 
- It is Vuk Brankovic's word. 
Obilic also isn't just someone, he's a Obilic. 
Because Vuk suspects Obilic, I suspect Vuk. 
It's not only about treason it's about conspiracy 
- You're not saying... 
We have spoken enough tonight. 
Even a blind man can see the obvious. 
It won't be hard for you to judge. 
How can I judge the one to whom I made the first toast? 
But how can I not judge him, if he is being accused by the one, to whom I have my first-born daughter? 
A detailed investigation would be necessary to find out the truth. 
But there is not time for that. 
The accuser was counting on that fact. 
Do you have any evidence whatsoever Obilic? 
Just that my evidence aren't words and my evidence is not here. I do. 
My evidence is in Kosovo. 
I will prove myself with the evidence. 
- Would you tell us how will you do that? 
We know how. 
So he betrays us to Murat. 
I swear before this bread and wine, before this living image of Jesus Christ 
that I will kill Murat tomorrow in Kosovo. 
He's crazy. 
- Obilic, do you know what you're saying? 
Tomorrow we all go to battle with the fear of dying and the hope of not dying. 
If the person that went to the Turks to kill Murat, cherished such a hope he would be crazy. 
If he didn't cherish such hope he would be crazy if he did go. 
There is no question about it with Obilic. 
Obilic doesn't care about hope, because he knows that he and Murat will be as alive tomorrow as they are today. 
Who is that crazy to believe someone who so easily makes such a difficult oath? 
Not me. 
Vuk Brankovic, tomorrow the trail of everyone, of you and me in Kosovo will be visible as in snow. 
On Vid's day we will see who is who. 
And to you prince Lazar, the one that slandered me at your place to you, Serbian knights, 
I will say only one thing. 
You, prince Stefan Lazar, and you, Mr. Vuk Brankovic, and you two, brothers Stevan and Lazar Music, and you, Milan Toplica, and you, Ivan Kosancic, and you, Tamnavec, and you, Levcanin, 
and all you other Serbian knights, and me with and among you, as we will be tomorrow, we will be for all eternity. 
I should have thrown him in jail. 
- Obilic said that he will kill Murat tomorrow, so you should judge about the oath tomorrow. 
Why did you all bow your heads? 
If Obilic has abandoned us God has not. 
You intend to go to Kosovo without Obilic? 
Whether or not I go to battle doesn't depend on how strong my army is, it depends on the sacred thing I defend. 
We have no wine left. 
I'll fetch another goblet. Here. 
What kind of money is this? 
- Silver dinar of Vuk Brankovic, coined in Prizren. 
- Instead of Lazar there's St. Stefan. 
Why would Vuk do that? 
- Show me. 
Vuk probably asked himself what so many marriages meant. 
You mean Lazar's daughters? 
Vuk now has 3 brothers-in-law. 
Maybe Vuk asked himself, whom Lazard would give Olivera. 
Maybe he'll give her to Obilic. 
Vuk could also ask himself, who would rule Serbia if Lazar was to fall in action in Kosovo tomorrow. 
Be careful witch, better stick to your fish. 
Turn out the candle. 
You don't want me to fetch the wine? 
- Let me sleep. 
Who's singing at this time of hour? 
The army that is going to Kosovo. 
The Communion in Kosovo will start any minute now. 
We'll soon be there. 
Promise to help me. 
They're already carrying the icons and banners from the church. 
I can't paint anything as long as I don't see with my clerical eyes as you do. 
- Everyone is already over there except for us. 
- No they aren't. 
What do you mean they aren't, if the whole of Kosovo is glaring from the knight arms? 
Serbian knights are glaring in Kosovo the most glaring of them is Lazar. Those aren't knights those are fireflies and dew. 
What do you have your eyes for? 
Do I, blind man, have to show you what is what? 
I want to see the essence which is invisible to the human eye. 
Did you forget that you would have to sacrifice your bodily eyes, to see with you your clerical eyes? 
- I didn't. 
Are you prepared to pay such price? 
- How many times should I tell you? 
The Patriarch's prayer will start any minute. 
When will I go blind? 
I call and ask holy warriors Jurij and Dimitrij, 
St. Prokopij, St. Teodor Tiron and Teodor Stratilat, 
Merkurij, St. Artemij, St. Nikita... 
Take a good look at all of this, because you're watching it for the very last time. 
Support us and take us to battle like reapers to harvest and that we return from battle like reapers from harvest with abundant bread. 
Shine on us today, let heaven be filled with icons on the holy banners. 
Give us the strength, so we fight bravely for eternity and righteous life. 
What are the Serbian priests singing? 
- The liturgy. 
You listened to it before the battle at Plocnik. 
- I'm not trembling from this singing but because of the summer coldness. 
Do you feel that the moonlight smells of linden and acacian honey today? 
It smells to me more like wormwood. 
- It doesn't matter anyway. 
In less then an hour, everything, from the moonlight and the wind, 
Europe and Asia, the sky and the earth will smell of blood. 
I hope it will smell more of Serbian then Turkish blood. 
You talking as though it weren't two armies fighting, but two planet. 
You're not with the army yet, Jakub? 
One question has been troubling me. 
- Again? 
What question? 
- There are Serbian aristocrats among us. 
- So what? 
How much can we trust them? 
Will Serbs fight against other Serbs? 
How can someone be a brother to a stranger, who is a stranger to his own brother? 
If they betrayed their own, they can betray us too. 
The battle will already begin and end and he'll still be asking questions. 
I didn't ask you. 
Its the easiest thing to do, to chop off the defeated King's head, but it's not the smartest thing to do. 
It can still be of some use to you. How? 
Who crowned himself, cares more about the crown, then his head, so he would give his head his people, his country and faith for the crown, but he wouldn't renounce his crown not even for his honour. 
To retain this royal or princely crown they defend more eagerly then the aga's and bey's in their countries the rights of our Islamic country and faith. 
If it is so, shouldn't we get Lazar this way? 
The Serbian Communion has ended. 
Their knights have gotten on horses. 
- Everyone to your respective places. 
The first Serbian blow will be the strongest. 
Did prince Lazar gallop before the army? 
His helmet with the horns can be seen from far away. 
So we grab him with both hands by the horns. 
Bajazit, you better shut up and hurry. 
The Serbian cavalry will attack. 
Serbian and Turkish banners are mixed up. 
It didn't start as it should have. 
What is happening to our front line? 
The Serbs are penetrating it like an iron waterfall. 
Luckily there's our best infantry. 
They must hold out the first wave of attacks. 
- If it goes on like this, they won't. 
Is this how you wage war? 
What is happening there? 
- Serbian men at arm have broken the infantry. 
Where? 
- On the Jakuba Celebija wing. 
- Impossible. 
Our front line is retreating. 
Second line is yielding. 
Go find Jakub at once. 
Where did those Serbian banners among the tents come from? 
They reached our train. 
- This is complete chaos. 
The Serbs have stopped over there but Jakub is almost totally battered. 
Let Balaban transfer the janissaries as soon as possible, 
Stop this offensive and go into a counterattack. 
Bajazit Ilderim is informing us that he is beating Vukovic's army, that he separated it from the main body of the army and is pushing it towards Lab. 
Tell him to slower the offensive. 
Let him wait, so Jakub pulls himself together on the left wing. 
Maybe Vukovic is leading him into a trap with the retreat. 
His spear is inverted the wrong way. 
- So he means to surrender. 
And who is that hero? 
- Duke Milos Obilic. 
Does anyone know anything about this Obilic? 
- He's Lazar's best duke. 
If he was the best we wouldn't invert the spear the wrong way. 
Bring him to me. 
Be careful, it may be a deception. 
Accede and bow to the sultan. 
Noble sultan. 
Don't you Serbs know how to approach a Turkish sultan? 
How? 
- Kneel down and kiss his shoe. 
I didn't come as a servant but as a knight. 
Where is that doctor? 
- Call Mustafa. 
Why didn't you take his knife? 
- I thought he only had a spear. 
Call Bajazit! 
Is there any hope? - No way. 
His abdomen is rip open. 
You need a grave digger not a doctor. 
Move out of the way Give him some air. 
Padishah opened his eyes. He regained his consciousness. 
Soon he will close them forever. 
Don't move, sultan. 
Is that one alive? - He's alive. 
- Say and he'll lose his head. 
Bring him to me. 
Are you mad enough to think that my death will determine the outcome of this battle? 
If it won't determine today's it will determine tomorrow's. 
What tomorrow's? 
You'll die today. 
- Let him speak. 
Let it be known that Serbia is a soft rug. 
That Kosovo is no silky pillow. 
Serbs have something more dear to them then their own life. 
Dog! 
- Don't beat him tied up. 
- But he's barking. 
Serbia isn't a handful of rice for every crow that the wind brings. 
Leave the crow and rice alone. 
Tell me, what is so precious more precious then life. 
What did you sacrifice your head for today? 
I gave my head for my word. 
I can't laugh. 
Because you're paying with your head for a word doesn't mean, that your word is so precious but that your head is so cheap. 
If it wasn't for that word, what else would be left? 
- Listen, boy. 
In less then half an hour we'll both be just worm food, despite your word and all of my army. 
Is he alive? 
Are you badly wounded? 
- I can't hold my guts with my hands. 
Is this the murderer? - Yes. 
- What are you waiting for? 
We're waiting for your decision, master. 
- Chop off his head. 
Did you notify Jakub? 
- Not yet. We have waited for you. 
You're smart, Miralem. 
I won't forget it. 
Where are you taking him? 
- To the oak tree. 
- Do it here. 
Let sultan see him die. 
And you send someone for Jakub who still doesn't know what has happened. 
He should tell him, that Murat is calling for him, not me. 
Bogoje? 
I'm no longer Bogoje, but Mustafa 
I'm no longer Christian but Muslim, 
I'm no longer a doctor or a medicus, but a Hakim. 
I don't visit a church anymore, but a mosque. 
- For God's sake... 
Don't wonder. 
Brankovic drove me to another religion. 
They have persecuted you, so they could get me. 
They wanted to destroy me, so they would take down Lazar. 
Who is the hero that hit me? 
Serb Hamza. - That's why he hits also when it isn't necessary. 
No one trusts a turned Turk. 
If a Turk is bleeding down to his elbows, he must bleed to his shoulders. 
- You have learned that fast, Mustafa. 
Well Jaur, are you ready to meet your own God? 
I am. - Allah is merciful. 
Maybe he will help you. 
God will help me as i have not renounced him. 
All your bloodshed is in vain today. 
I am drawing in borders with my blood. 
- What border? 
The one between me and you. 
- Cut the dog. 
Impale him on the spear. 
Master, the Padishah is dying. 
Your murderer is dead. 
Look at him. Should I lift your head? 
- I'm still alive, and I hear they're already calling you master. 
Listen, Bajazit. 
Don't forget that Jakub is your brother. 
Don't worry. 
Does it hurt you much? 
But it is degrading. 
I don't know why a man needs as much intestine as a ram. 
Don't let him talk so much. 
- When will I talk, if not now? 
Bajazit, don't forget that a brother is sacred. 
Did you hear me? 
I heard you. 
- Save your strength and don't provoke hatred. 
If you want to divide Serbia, rely only on the Serbs. 
They will do a better job then you. 
Look, behind Kosovo there are churches standing one behind another. 
Studenica, Zica, Ravanica. 
Behind these Serbian churches are German, Roman, Florentine and Venetian churches. 
And churches in Paris and Rouen. 
Till where you hear the church bell, till there you will have to unlatch the arrow of Islam. 
Do you remember Ali's bequest? 
- He said : Torture the Jaurs wherever you can. 
Better to look for them with your sabres in their houses, then to wait for them with the spoons in your own. 
Your talk is in vain. 
He died. 
Close his tent. 
The army musn't know about his death till the end of the battle. 
I'm taking over the battle into my own hands. 
What is happening? Why aren't you on the battlefield? 
Why is father calling for me? 
He's altering the plan. 
- Why did he close the tent? - Because of the heat. 
Where does all this blood come from? 
- You're asking where the blood comes from in the middle of a battle? 
That's why you aren't doing that well. 
- Is he angry because of the retreat? 
No, he's happy that the Serbs are advancing. 
What are you doing? 
Leave me alone! 
Bajazit, where is the sultan? 
Is the sultan alive? 
Bajazit, what have you done to Murat? 
What should i do, master? 
- They're already calling you master? 
Traitors. 
- Strangle him with a silky string. 
You'll strangle your brother? 
Murat said that a brother is sacred. 
He is. But I am a brother too. 
Jakub's brother. 
I am sacred too. 
- I'll never recognize you as a master. 
Do you have the string or not? 
- What are you waiting for? 
For me to order that they use it to strangle you? 
Murderer! 
Bajazit! 
Brother! 
Prepare two stretchers for Murat and Jakub. 
We'll bury them in Bursa. 
Now we have to end this battle as soon as possible. 
Let the buzundzija's shout and wail. 
What are we paying them for? 
Everyone should set out to counterattack. 
Let's tip the balance in our favor. 
What are you waiting for? 
- I'll fly as an arrow. 
Fly faster then lightning. 
Vlatko Vukovic is leaving the battle and returning to Bosnia. 
Pasha Sarudza asks for enforcements. 
He's still stronger then the Serbs. Let him continue the fight. 
The army is assembling around prince Lazar. 
Our forces are swarming around him like bees swarm around honey. 
Attack Lazar with all of your forces. 
Serbs are amid chaos. 
Lazar fell from a wounded horse, the army thinks he's dead and is running away. 
Don't give the Serbs any time to breathe. 
Beware of Vuk Brankovic. 
- He withdrew from Kosovo. 
Withdrew? 
- Withdrew. 
News for Padishah. 
- Let me here them. 
The janissaries have captured a Serbian prince. 
- What are you saying? 
And a lot of magnates. 
Last night in gold and silk, today muddy and bloody. 
Last night on his throne, today in the bear's hole. 
This is also coming from God. 
- If you knew last night, what you know today, you wouldn't be here. 
- I didn't know last night, that I'm buying myself eternity with this suffering. 
Nonsense. 
Your head will fall over here in the dust. 
Your life isn't worth a nickel. 
Life values as much, as you're willing to pay for it. 
Never mind these cliches and face the facts. 
Kosovo is full of facts without heads, hands and legs. 
If I compare our victory and your defeat... 
- My defeat? 
Your defeat is in the fact that you don't see our victory. 
- Victory? 
Is this victory? 
You have lost too much blood and you haven't come to yourself. 
Look around you. 
Is this your victory, Lazar? 
Are the corpses in Lab and Sitnica the corpses of victors? 
Do these broken hands and legs belong to victors? 
Is this head on the spear, that is looking at its corpse on the ground, a head of a victor? 
Yes, Bajazit. 
Take a look at it well so you remember it. 
You don't see a head like this every day. 
- If life is really as precious as you say why didn't Brakovic pay for it as much? 
Vuk's life is not worth it, Obilic's is. 
Come closer, Bajazit. 
Look, how beautiful this head is with which the heavenly kingdom is being bought. 
You wouldn't get an onion for this head. 
This head doesn't lay into a grave but into a foundation. 
This head talks too much. 
Chop it off. 
Allow me, noble sultan. 
- Who are you? 
- Servant Milutin. 
Don't ask for his life. 
- Allow me, noble sultan, to take into this sinful hands Lazar's sacred head. 
Accept it. 
I don't think he will feel any more easy about it. 
Tell me now Lazar, who is the victor. 
You with the head on the scaffold or me with the crown on my head? 
Your scaffold is only a threshold to me. 
As far as the victory is concerned, we have fought in different battles. 
You have won in yours, I have won in mine. 
Thank you, Lord for allowing me, to be warmed by the evening of a sunny day on this threshold. 
Another victorious head. 
Last night on throne, today on the scaffold. 
- And in the evening on the cloud. 
A cap is more worth now then a head. 
Even if it's not worth a grain of bean I'll give you a pearl grain for it. 
Stretch out your hand. 
- My hand was sanctified by this head. 
Chop off his sanctified hand, so it doesn't get greased tomorrow. 
What about the other Serbian aristocrats? 
- Kill them. 
- All of them? - All. 
It seems that the battle is over. 
The stretchers with Murat and Jakub shall be carried with the greatest honour. 
Let's hurry to Bursa. 
- The troops are restless because of Jakub. 
We have to deal with it immediately. 
- How? 
- You know, how. 
There are only two ways, advancement and execution. 
Hurry up. 
Strangle Kapidza Pasha at once. 
Those that support me shall advance. 
Clear up this heads and corpses it's hot. 
Everything splendid and faithful died on Kosovo Polje. 
Only the unfaithful survived Kosovo. 
Only the unfaithful returned home from Kosovo. 
Us unmarried widows are looking at them from the thresholds. 
Whom shall we marry, whose children should we widows give birth to? 
Should we continue the treacherous origin? 
Or will each of us go after our dead hero to no-time, from no-place. 
A fiancee for a live hero, a bride for a dead one. 
What are you carrying in your bag? 
- Just oats. 
Unless they stole the oats and put a candle into my bag. Something is glistening. 
- What is it? 
- Your bag? 
Your hay is burning. 
- Burning? 
Probably some firefly. 
Let me help you. 
- I didn't stop to rest, but to listen. 
Do you hear me? 
- Birds barking From Kosovo, from human flesh the bark of crows and ravens is rising. What is this? 
They say they're on the threshold of Pristina. 
- Move out of the way. 
Who are you saying this to? Him, the martyr and hero? 
Shall he move away from the prince with whom he fought along, from the saint that also, sanctified him? 
Respect his wooden leg, you wooden head. 
- Listen, you... I have listened enough. 
- Shut up. 
Look the princess Milica is coming, our woman martyr 
Take off your cap. 
She has come to expect her martyr. 
I am the only salvation for Serbia that also suits you. 
Me? 
- You. 
Lazarj's crown will be succeeded after me by my sons, your grandsons Grgur, Djuradj, Lazar. 
Lazar didn't die in Kosovo so we quarrel because of the crown but to unite around his head. 
Whatever, Mrs Milica, Lazar is dead, Vuk is alive. 
Both is good for Serbia. 
For which Serbia, Vuk Brankovic? 
For the Serbia that doesn't defend itself when being chopped? 
Which has it's eyes closed and is silent when it's being burned down and when others administer it in their own way? 
When others command her what to sow and reap. 
What and from whom it shall buy and whom it shall sell. 
For the Serbia, which forgets about it's own children, heroes and martyrs, dresses, feeds and glorifies those that dream of burying it. 
Many times wa have been led by those that we have fed and watered and been fooled by them. 
Which Serbia will you choose? 
The Turks have finally destroyed the Serbian empire in Kosovo. 
Serbia wasn't defeated by the Turks in Kosovo but by its own magnates. 
- If Serbia wants to save itself, it must forget about Kosovo as soon as possible. 
- What should it remember? 
Kosovo opens for Serbia the doors of hell. 
Kosovo lifts Serbia to heaven. 
Lazar is coming. 
Until we transfer him to Ravanica, he will be here in Pristina. 
The assembly that has enthroned Lazar, will with God's blessing enthrone Lazar's son upon him. 
If you will enthrone this child and not me, you will not only be in war with the Turks but also with me. 
Where are you now, Lazar? 
- He has carried our burden with him to the sky. 
Where have you gone? 
Whom did you leave us to? 
In which holy land should we bury you, Lazar's head? 
We will not bury Lazar's head. 
We will lay it in the ground like seed. 
How should I weep for you, how should I not mourn for you, when everything in this world has ended for me? 
How should I not rejoice, when you have returned glittering. 
You left as a great hero and returned as a great martyr. 
You're returning bigger as you were when you left. 
How could we not glorify you today, when you are rising to the clouds with the rain of our tears, to accept the upper crown, and leave us in this blind world, where Stefan will be out eyes? 
Help us, oh Lord, that the ruined to to ashes from ashes it rises, that the disunited unites, that the blind sees, that the killed, tortured, burned down, slaughtered, downtrodden, hung 
and torn apart, in known and unknown graves buried, from all the graves risen, entire Serbia comes under one crown. 
You have lost your bodily eyes, but you have not seen with the clerical ones. 
Are you listening to me? 
- I think I am slowly starting to see. 
Something is warming you and you're hoping, it's shining. 
I think I see. 
- What do you see? 
A man that is leaving for a path. 
I can see that he has trespassed a border. 
I don't see him anymore. 
Look more carefully beyond this border. 
I only see a spider crawling along the path. 
Look closer at this spider. 
- Are you going to say it's a human? 
Do you know which human this spider is? 
We have to try to look over the upper border which is glaringly evading us. 
Which we were shown by, towards which he led us and across which he left for the golden worlds Lazar. 
Let's NDP here. 
We're gonna NDP here. 
Eriksson, hold up. 
Set up claymores on the left flank. 
Did that sound hollow to you, man? 
What? 
Wait. 
We could be standing right over their tunnels right now, couldn't we? 
Right under us at this very second could be VC tunnels. 
- Shit! 
- What was that? 
Fix that sound! 
- I hate fucking mortars. 
- Fix that sound, sergeant. 
They're after somebody else. 
Who are they after? 
- Is it 3rd Platoon? 
- Captain Hill says Alpha's hit. 
- Do they know we're here? 
- What do you say, Meserve? 
- I'll get it to you ASAP. 
- Sergeant Hawthorne! 
Set out security to the flanks, front and rear. 
But not too far so they get separated from us. 
Eriksson, take the right flank. 
Call Superman 0-2. 
We need a fix on the tube. 
We'll adjust by the sound. 
Superman 0-2, Superman 0-2.... 
- What the fuck is going on? 
- Cease fire! 
I saw a gook, sarge. 
One of them gooks from the ville. 
- You recognizing people? 
- I saw him! 
The tube's kicking ass on Alpha. 
Fuck this! 
The tube's got a fix on us! 
Oh, Christ! 
They found us! 
They're walking them in on us! 
Superman 0-2, Superman 0-2. 
Let's move! 
The tube's got a fix on us. 
Left flank! 
Move on! 
Silent Twin 0-2, out. 
Go! 
Go! 
Oh, Jesus! 
Oh, Jesus! Jesus Christ! 
Oh, God! 
- Where's Hawthorne? 
- Up this way. 
Eriksson's on right flank. 
He ain't in yet. 
This war's getting old, Mr. Meserve. 
Here comes arty! 
Fuck! 
Oh, shit! 
Oh, Jesus! 
Okay, Brownie, you get up there with them. 
Keep your shit together. 
My shit is forever together. 
I'm an armour-plated motherfucker! 
Oh, fuck! 
Help me! 
Oh, fuck! 
Somebody help me! 
What's wrong with my arm? 
Where's my arm? 
- I got something for you. 
- You gotta find my arm. 
- We gotta move! 
- Calm down, soldier! 
Help me! 
Somebody help me! 
Help! 
Here's your arm. 
Here's your arm. 
Somebody help me! 
Help! 
Help! 
Help me! 
Somebody! 
Sarge, I need help! 
Sarge, help me! I'm stuck! 
Oh, I'm stuck. 
Help me. 
- Thank God! 
- Pull! 
Oh, shit! 
I'll put some tracers up there. 
- Back me up with the thumper, okay? 
- Right. 
- Ready? - Yeah. 
Get some, motherfucker! 
Get some! 
Motherfucker! 
Yeah, you fuck! 
Yeah. 
Some mad fucking minute, huh, cherry? 
- We're getting too short for this. 
- We ain't short yet. 
Thirty days and a wake-up. 
We damn near invisible. 
You're gonna DEROS out of this jungle and these clothes. 
Put me on that Freedom Bird and I figure I'm short and maybe the fucker's gonna crash. 
Can you imagine that? 
Escape from Nam... 
-... to die an airline fatality. 
- Never happen, cherry. 
You survive the Nam, you get to live forever. 
How long you been here? 
- Three weeks. 
- Three weeks? 
You're breaking my heart. 
You know, Meserve, I've been thinking. 
Maybe it's time we stopped balling these bitches. 
We might end up home diseased. 
Dinky dau, man. 
The Nam's a trip. 
First you don't know shit, then you don't give a shit. 
I mean, you care, but it's just humpbacked and crooked, you know? 
The cherry'll get wasted because he don't know nothing. 
We'll end up in peril because we don't care about nothing. 
- I care, Brown. 
- Sure you do. 
It's just humpbacked and crooked, you know? 
Clark you and Hatcher and Eriksson spread out here. 
Stay alert. 
And don't get lost. 
Brownie, let's didi. 
Hershey bar number one! 
Good stuff. Take a big bite. 
Check out this sad ass, man. 
Sui? 
It's mango. 
Quit begging. 
They don't want your candy bar. 
Give it to me. 
Cam on ong very much. 
Don't eat anything they give you. 
Go back where you're supposed to be. 
You want to die horribly? 
- No, sarge. 
- You were gonna eat it? 
These people are confused. 
Are they Cong or not? 
- They're schizophrenic. 
- Depends on who scared them last. 
You eat some razor blades or glass in something they give you... 
-... what are you dead of? 
- Stupidity. 
It's a rog, Brown. 
Much affirmed. 
Yes, indeed. 
We're overjoyed to have travelled 11, 000 miles to assist them in their struggle to upgrade themselves. 
Every one of them is old or kids. 
That ain't good. 
This is a retirement ville. 
Sort of like Florida. 
I wasn't gonna eat that. 
I didn't want to be rude. 
- Rude? 
- Yeah. 
I'll smack you upside the head for talking that foolishness! 
You do something rude, you say," Sorry about that." 
For example, you strangle their chickens cop their rice, or barbecue their fucking hootch you say," Sorry about that." 
Let me hear you say it. 
" Sorry about that." 
Sorry about that. 
I got something for us, sir. 
We asked him which path was safe. 
One day he says one, next day the other. 
You VC? VC? 
Number fucking 10! 
VC? 
- You number fucking 10? - No! 
- You VC? 
- VC, no! 
All right! 
We got it! 
Number one, old man. 
I hope that ain't your idea of fun, buddy. 
This is some piece of equipment! 
Don't look like it to me. 
Look like some tree got tangled up. 
And this fool gonna tie it to his cow. 
Do you know how one of these things works? 
Ain't you supposed to be hauling water to your pals instead of hanging out with this motherfucker? 
- Yeah. 
- So let's go, then. 
Right. Okay. 
No, no, no. 
All right. 
Shit. 
Sarge wants us together, we best do it. 
Don't you want to get home for your own plowing? 
- You're married, right? 
- Yeah. 
Yeah, yeah, come on, motherfucker! 
What the fuck was I talking about, man? 
This some bad-ass Thai stick, man. 
You got any babies? 
That's what I was talking about. 
- A little girl. 
- A little girl? 
Now ain't that my point? 
What were you doing back there? 
Sarge had to save you. 
The ground opened up on me. 
I'm hanging there. 
Half in, half out of one of the tunnels. 
Mortar rounds coming straight at me. 
Boom, boom, boom! 
- I couldn't believe it. 
- Did you pee your pants? 
- Don't be shy. Talk to me. 
- I'm talking. 
You ain't telling me nothing. 
Your ass was stuck in a rabbit hole? 
So, what happened? 
- Man, come on. 
- Come on. 
Think of me as your priest. 
- Lutherans don't have priests. 
- Did you pee your pants? 
If the sarge hadn't come back for me, I sure would have. 
Without sarge, you ain't nothing but a sack of shit. 
You ain't walking along jiving with me. 
You so much grief bagged and tagged that your people moan all their lives. 
Right, sarge? 
Hatch! 
- Hatcher! 
- What? 
You got 30 days to learn what you can from me and Meserve. 
Hatcher! 
- Listen up. 
- I'm listening. 
We gonna DEROS and leave Freedom Frontier- - 
One o'clock! 
Behind you! 
Oh, my God, I hit it! 
Sarge! 
All right, cease fire! Cease fire! 
- I told you this place wasn't safe. 
- The bastards set us up! 
Sarge, I'm in trouble, man. 
I'm in trouble, sarge. 
- It ain't nothing, Brownie. 
- You sure, man? 
It sure feels like something. 
It feels bad, sarge. 
It ain't nothing, man. 
Eriksson, the sarge says I'm gonna be okay, man. 
Oh, yeah. 
No sweat, Brownie. 
Fuck this shit, man! Fuck this! 
Let's go, let's go! 
Come on, move it! 
Sarge! 
Look in my fucking eyes! 
I'm gonna hypnotize you! 
You're fine. 
I know it, man. I know it. 
I'm an armour-plated motherfucker. 
I'm an armour-plated motherfucker. 
I'm an armour-plated motherfucker. 
Sergeant! 
Sergeant Meserve, you're to go two clicks back to the road. 
APCs are there to take you to Ap Thanh. 
Take a truck back to Wolf. 
The company's regrouping there. 
- Is that understood? 
- You better watch your back here. 
This ville is bullshit. 
They're harboring VC. 
We'll bust some chops before we leave. 
- Don't you worry. 
- Torch the fucking place. 
Hey, hey, there it is. 
My rack, my rack! 
So, what are you gonna do? 
Get shitfaced and go hump the brains out of some hos. 
- I don't know. 
I'm too tired. - Come on. 
Are we on duty or off? 
Let me have a beer. - No. 
You should have bought more. 
- Give the guy a beer. 
- They're mine. 
- I'll give you 1000 pi. 
- You should have thought ahead. - 10,000 pi. 
For one? 
Oreos. 
I'll give you some cookies. 
- I was hoping you were still around. 
- Forget about it. 
We just spent some time in a combat zone. 
The lieutenant had difficulty getting his head out of his ass and left us in the jungle like a bunch of crazed motherfuckers. 
- What happened to you guys? 
- I don't think anybody knows. 
- I just about got killed, though. 
- What was that like? 
I went nuts. 
- You wanna shower? 
- Later. 
Come on, I want to shower. 
Let's go shower. 
Hey, sarge. 
It's the sarge. 
This asshole, Clark, bought one beer off me for 10,000 pi. 
Ain't that some shit? 
Sarge, are we on duty or off? 
- Off. 
- Fucking-A. 
We've been detailed a long-range recon in the morning. 
We're off till 2100. 
Where we gonna go? 
The lieutenant will brief me. 
I'll brief you guys, 2100. 
We're out of here at 0600. 
- We're off till then? 
- Yeah. 
Sarge, we're gonna take a shower. 
What are you gonna do? 
I'm gonna go into town and get laid. 
What do you hear about Brownie? 
He's dead. 
This place is bullshit. 
I hate this fucking place. 
- They ought to blow it up and pave- - 
- Fucking-A. 
Brownie could make me laugh, man. 
And I like to fucking laugh. 
You know I never knew a far-out spade dude like Brownie before Brownie. 
They shouldn't make you hump the boonies when you're short. 
They should send you home. 
You'd be short when you were close to where you didn't have to go. - So what? 
- So nobody'd want to go. 
I don't want to go now. 
They keep moving it back. 
Pretty soon they wouldn't send anybody here. 
What's wrong with that? 
What I'm saying is these fucking gooks are shit, man! 
They're lowlifes! 
Every motherfucker in that ville. 
Every man, woman and child knew about the fucking mortars. 
They knew about the snipers, and they just let them zap Brownie. 
They're slugs. 
They're roaches, and total destruction is the only way to deal with them. 
Sorry, sarge. 
Passes are cancelled. 
What? 
- The ville's off-limits. - What did he say? 
- For how long? 
- Indefinitely. 
He's serious, man. 
Fuck' em. 
- Watch it, sarge! - Come on. 
- Motherfucking-- 
- Take it easy. 
That was easy! 
- Motherfucking easy! 
- What we gonna do? 
Know what this shit's about? 
Fucking Cong is in town tonight. Charlie's in the whorehouse. 
- No shit? 
- Didn't you know? 
Charlie's gotta get laid too. 
He works hard killing us. Don't he? 
What are we gonna do, sarge? 
What are we gonna do? 
Goddamn it! 
The Cong's getting laid. 
And we're just.... 
It ain't fair, you know? 
Am I talking? 
I can't tell if I'm talking or not. 
Diaz, how you doing? 
Do one of you guys got a Playboy on you I can borrow? 
- Jeez, on me? - Yeah. 
- I gotta find one. 
- Somebody sent you a present. 
This is Diaz. 
He's Brown's replacement. 
We're out of here in the morning at 0500. 
I want everyone carrying two frags. 
Make sure you got smoke. Sit down. 
Leave your vest. 
I don't want any heat casualties. 
Beyond that, wear what you want, as long as it's charmed as long as it's helped you survive. 
Our destination is Hill 209 in the Tra Khuc Valley. 
The hill's here. 
There are caves, there might be VC. 
We're looking for tunnels, bunkers, unmapped trails, whatever. Now. 
The orders are we don't shoot except in self-defence. 
You get one of these fuckers out in the open, you waste him. 
We're leaving an hour early because we detour 2000 metres to the south to the ville of Nghia Hanh. 
What we're gonna do is requisition ourselves a girl. 
A little portable R and R. 
It'll break up the boredom, keep up morale. 
I want charmed people around me. 
So bring your good-luck stuff. 
Like this, sarge? 
Does it feel lucky? 
It looks lucky. 
He really say that? 
He wouldn't do it, would he? 
Bring a girl? 
Are you crazy? 
As short as he is? 
He is out of here in less than 30 days. 
So why did he say it? 
I don't know. 
What did the other guys think? 
Everybody was joking. 
Clark says : 
" What's this, some new addition to Lurp rations?" Right. 
I mean, some broad in your pack. 
You see how nuts that sounds? 
That'll never happen, G.I. 
That is the one, sarge. 
She's the pretty one. 
Take the pretty one. 
- Get over here, you fucking cunt! - Jesus God! 
What's going on? 
You guys done this before? 
No. 
This is unbelievable. 
I didn't think he meant it, Hatch. Did you? 
I don't know, man. 
I want to be out of here by first light. 
What do you want? 
What do you want? 
You want her to have this? 
All right, no sweat. 
No big thing. 
She can have it! 
Shut up, bitch! 
Let's get out of here, sarge. 
Get some rest. You're upset. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. 
We're gonna win her heart and mind. 
If she's got one. 
Hey, sarge. 
A few more clicks, we'll rest. 
- I thought you were kidding. 
- I was serious as a heart attack. 
That's what I mean. 
This is kidnapping, ain't it, sarge? 
Take the point. 
- Go relieve Hatch on point. - Why? 
You got the point. 
- Yeah. 
Right. 
Hatch, slow up. 
I'm supposed to relieve you. 
It's just like Genghis Khan, man. 
That's what I was thinking. 
- Ever heard of Genghis Khan? - What? 
- What are you talking about? 
- Meserve is unbelievable. 
I mean, what we're doing it's fantastic. 
Why didn't we think of it before? 
- This is nuts. 
- It ain't nuts. 
It's what armies do. 
- We ain't Genghis Khan. - You're the one who's nuts. 
It's the 20th century, man. 
We're supposed to be here to help. 
I'm definitely gonna fuck this bitch. 
What's the matter with you? 
Come here. 
Come here for a second. Come here. 
You all right? 
You all right? 
That was some hump, huh? 
You want some gum? 
I'm not gonna hurt you. 
Do I have to mess with her? 
Diaz.... 
No, man. 
Hey, come here. 
Come here, somebody. 
Somebody, come here, quick. 
- Come here. 
- Check it out, Clark. 
- Is that a farmer or VC? - Where? 
- In the pool. 
- What is it, Clark? 
- It's a rock, I think. - It's moving. 
The bushes are moving, the rock ain't. 
- What are you doing? 
- He said to shoot them in the open. 
It's a water buffalo, sarge. 
Dumb, very fucking dumb. 
Aspirin. 
Number one. Okay. 
Hey, sarge. 
We on track? 
Just follow the red Crayola line. 
Two and a half hours and we'll be there. 
Give me a minute on this thing we're doing. 
I mean, what we're doing. 
What are we doing, sarge? 
We have a VC suspect. Is that what you mean? 
She's a VC whore and we're gonna have fun with her. 
She's just a farm girl. 
You're the cherry here, right? So lighten up. 
- Let me carry the weight. 
- What's the problem, sarge? 
He don't think our VC whore is a VC whore. 
You've been in town. 
They'll sell their children. 
These people were sleeping in their hootch. 
He got the wrong outlook on this thing. 
You got the wrong outlook. 
- What are you talking about? 
- She's a VC. 
- She ain't. 
- I'm telling you, Eriksson. 
This ain't a VC. Clark ain't. 
Hatcher, he ain't no VC. 
Diaz ain't no VC. 
I ain't. 
I ain't no fucking VC. 
Now this? 
This here's a VC. 
And you? 
You I don't know about. 
You ain't cutting yourself this slack, man. 
You ain't humping your ruck, hump mine. - Why, man? 
- Just put it on. 
Hey, sarge! 
Hey! 
I'm a corporal, Hatcher. 
This is a direct order. 
You hump my ruck. 
Oh, man. What an asshole! 
It's all clear, sarge. 
The stream's 30 metres down. Plenty of water. 
Get her inside. 
Get your ruck off her, Hatcher. 
We'll use this place as our C.P. 
Eriksson, you and Diaz get the chow and ammo stored. 
Clark, you and Hatcher come with me. 
I ain't gonna rape nobody. 
You gotta back me up. 
- I'll back you. - Swear it. 
I do, man. I promise. 
You gotta back me too. 
You got it, man. 
I'm not gonna hurt you. You're cut. 
You're hurt. 
Let me fix it, okay? 
No, no, give. 
We'll get it clean. 
I'm not going to hurt you. 
Come here. 
Stay still. 
See? 
It's going to be okay. 
Okay, I'm your friend. 
I'm your friend. 
Mind if I pull up a chair? 
Go ahead. 
C-rats, huh? What you got there? 
- Franks and beans. 
- Army don't want to surprise us. 
Leave that to the dinks. 
How you doing? 
I'm all right. 
I'm sorry I jumped on you back there. 
We're out here with the Cong hanging in every tree waiting to grease us. 
Humping six hours of the worst bush. 
Gooks should be fighting to get out of here, not to keep it. 
Six hours of the ugliest snakes and spiders. 
All we have is each other. Right? 
Yeah. 
Come here. 
I don't want any problems with you. 
I'm counting on you in particular. 
I don't know what's going on here. 
We're gonna interrogate the prisoner. 
This isn't right. 
We ain't supposed to do this. 
Don't fuck with me. You're taking your turn. 
I ain't raping nobody. 
You're saying no to me? 
You ain't hotshot enough to say no. Motherfucker! 
Motherfucker! 
Think you're standing up to me? 
I ain't doing it. No way. 
Don't you like girls? 
You ain't got a pair? 
Is that your problem? 
- Sarge? 
- He don't want to ball the dink. 
- Chickenshit. - Is that it? 
Is that your problem? 
- So, what is it? 
- Maybe he's queer. 
- You a faggot? 
- Is that it? - No! 
So, what is it? 
Everybody else is up for this. 
What are you looking at Diaz for? 
He's with the program. You got a problem? 
- Hell, no. - Okay. 
Would you stop looking at Diaz? 
Oh, wait a minute. Maybe he is a queer. 
Maybe Eriksson's a homosexual. 
We got us two gals. Is Eriksson a faggot? 
- I don't know. 
- I think so. 
He's chickenshit. I'm gonna cut his heart out. 
How we gonna count on you? 
You're a VC sympathizer. 
You could get killed real easy. 
Somebody stumbles.... They don't mean to shoot you. 
Friendly fucking casualty. 
I mean, a body bag's a body bag. 
Your mama and your daddy are crying. - He's dead. 
- What? 
- My father's dead. 
- Nobody cares about your history. 
You're taking your turn. 
In there. 
Maybe when I'm done with her, I'm gonna come after you. 
When I'm done humping her, I'm gonna hump you! 
You're taking an attack posture with me? 
Yeah, you got a weapon. 
Clark got a weapon. Anybody can blow anybody away any second. He's got a knife. 
We all got weapons. 
Which is the way it ought to be. Always. 
The Army calls this a weapon. 
But it ain't. 
This is a weapon. 
This is a gun. 
This is for fighting. 
This is for fun. 
Are you gonna watch? 
Take security, Eriksson. 
You got security. 
- Who's next, man? - Not you, man! 
I wish we had some beers. 
I'd really like an ice-cold beer. 
Better than nothing. Wish we had a beer. 
Don't you wish you had a beer? 
Are we gonna flip a coin? 
- Diaz is next. - When am I up, sarge? 
- After Clark. 
- That's last. 
Move it, Diaz, move it! 
We ought to have some goddamn beers. - Shut the fuck up. 
- I just want a beer, man. 
We should gag her. 
We'll have VC all over our case. 
Hatcher manages three strokes, then he goes- -Iike a fucking mouse. 
Clark had his knife to her throat. So what? 
What do you mean? 
When is the last time you had a real woman? 
She was real. 
I think she was real. 
My brother had this car, man. 
It was a' 57 Chevy Bel Air. 
Raked, nosed. 
Had 10 coats of hand-rubbed candy-apple-red lacquer. 
The coolest. 
It had a 283 in it, bored and stroked. 
The fastest thing in the street! 
Diaz will relieve you at 2400, okay? 
You probably like the Army, don't you? 
I hate the Army. 
This ain't the Army. 
This ain't the Army, sarge. 
Yea, though I walk through the valley of evil I shall fear no death. 
'Cause I'm the meanest motherfucker in the valley. 
It's a bunch of them little people. 
There you go. 
What do you think? 
There's something happening here. 
Maybe they're just fishing. 
You two get back to the hootch. 
Load up on extra ammo and smoke grenades. 
Diaz, get Big Brother. 
I want support. 
Big Brother 0-2, this is Silent Twin 0-2. 
Fucking bullshit, man. 
What did I do to deserve this? 
I'm sick of babysitting this whore. 
What's happening? 
- Meserve wants ammo. 
- We're gonna light them up. 
- Where's Meserve? 
- He's at the ridge. 
What do I do, man? Babysit the whore while you guys waste some gooks? 
What'd he say about me? 
He didn't say anything. 
All right, man. 
I'm saying it. I'm going up there, man. 
Eriksson, you stay here. 
- I'm supposed to go. 
- I'm going up there and get some. 
I ain't gonna miss this. 
You ready? - Meserve won't like this. 
- I'm a corporal. 
You're a PFC. 
Now you stay here. 
- Let's didi, Hatch. 
- We're gonna K.I.A. some VC. Fucking-A. 
No more. 
No more. 
I'm not gonna hurt you. 
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay? 
I just want to untie you. 
Just a minute. 
Okay. 
Oh, God! 
I'm sorry. 
My friends number 10. 
You're sick, huh? 
You're sick? 
It's okay. 
Oh, man, you're burning up. 
You're hot. 
You hungry? 
Hungry, food? 
Eat, okay? 
Number one. Get you something to eat. 
Okay? 
Number one. 
It's good, it's good. 
It's okay. 
Okay, okay, take it easy. 
I don't understand. 
I don't know what you're saying. 
I don't know what you're saying. 
- What's happening? 
- Why are you here? 
- Shit's happening. 
- Where's Eriksson? 
- In the hootch. - You left him alone with the whore? 
Are you nuts? 
Go get him up here. Get everybody and everything up here ASAP. 
I gotta do everything? 
I'm gonna take you out of here. 
Okay? 
You. 
You. You, me, we go. 
We're gonna didi. 
We're gonna go home. 
Home. 
We go home in the ville. 
Thank God. 
Okay, that's right. 
Wait a minute. 
I can't go. 
You go. 
Go, go! 
I can't go! I'll be a goddamn deserter. 
Go! 
No, I'm sorry! 
I can't do this! You don't understand! 
Oh, Jesus. 
What are you doing? 
Nothing, man. 
Meserve wants everybody up top. 
Shut the fuck up! 
She'll give us away with all that coughing. 
We gotta waste her. 
- Eriksson, waste the bitch. 
You heard me. 
Another boat, sarge. 
Get Reilly. 
I want that support. 
Slicks, snakes, everything. 
Right, sarge. 
Big Brother 0-2, this is Silent Twin 0-2, over. 
I want you to waste her. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
- Kill the bitch. 
- You're nuts! Brownie would kick your ass on this. 
He would not tolerate this bullshit! 
Brownie ain't on my frequency no more. 
Brownie's dead. You on my frequency, motherfucker? 
If you ain't, you're K.I.A., just like the gooks. 
Let her go, sarge! 
What she gonna do, man? 
- Hatcher, waste her. 
- What? 
- I'll do it. - No, Hatcher's gonna do it. 
- Why me? 
- You piece of shit. 
You do what I say. I don't want to. 
Choppers, sarge. 
Goddamn it! 
They're gonna see her. 
We gotta get rid of her. 
We'll have every bird circling this area. 
Diaz! 
- Do it! - I'll do it, sarge. 
- Diaz is gonna do it. 
Do it! 
- Diaz, no, man. 
- You yellow piece of shit! 
Be a man! 
- Don't do it. - Be a man! 
Do it! Do it! 
- Don't do it! 
- Do it! 
- Don't let him make you. 
- Don't do it, man! 
- Do it! Do it! 
You fucking piece of shit, do it! 
- Diaz! 
Diaz! 
- Do it! 
Do it! - Do it! 
- Diaz! 
You don't have to worry about her coughing anymore! 
Eriksson, you stay here! 
Everybody else move! 
You cover! Now we're in the shit. 
Take no names and count the bodies! 
What the hell is that? 
It's a gunboat. 
I fixed her, sarge. 
Everybody, move! 
Right flank! 
Right flank! Switch with me, Hatch. 
Get some, motherfuckers! 
Oh, God! 
- She's getting away! 
She's getting away! 
She's getting away! 
That bitch! 
I stuck her more than twice! 
Waste her! 
- No! 
Stop it! 
Shoot her! 
Shoot her! 
Shoot her! 
Let's make our hat! 
Rowan! 
They did it. 
We didn't think they would but they did. 
They killed her. 
- The girl? - This ain't supposed to happen. 
We go into this ville. 
We just march in and they take this girl. They fucked her and killed her. 
Jesus Christ. 
I mean, this ain't supposed to happen. 
Hatcher's talking.... 
Hatcher's talking about Genghis Khan. 
- Meserve said I'm K.I.A. 
- And Clark? 
- He's nuts. 
- He's here. Eriksson, what are you talking to him about? 
I'm allowed to be talking to him. 
What happens in the field stays in the field, man. 
You know that. 
Everybody knows that. 
Clarkie, where's Meserve? 
What happened? 
You disappeared. 
I got choppered out, Clark. 
- We have to regroup- - 
- Don't pull at me! 
Don't pull at me. 
Reilly said in an hour. 
- I'll be there. - You better be, cherry. 
Victor Charles Cong is hardcore. 
They said that we were on alert. 
I said," I am always on alert." 
- Did you see him, man? 
- That was freaky, man. 
They get me back in the bush, I'm coming back in a bag. 
You gotta tell somebody. 
Who do you think? 
- Tell Reilly. 
- Hill's the captain. 
You should tell Reilly first. 
All right. 
On the day I was born, my mama grunted. 
I popped out. 
Took one look around. 
" Shit," I says," it's Two Creeks, Texas." 
So about eight years ago I'm still in Two Creeks. 
My wife's about to have our first child. 
I took her to the hospital, a natural thing to do. 
She was refused admittance to this hospital on the basis of her race. 
Which is, as you might guess, Negro. 
Next thing I know, the baby ain't about to wait. 
So my son is born on the goddamn floor of this hospital's reception room. 
Eriksson, I flipped the fuck out. 
I started turning over chairs kicking lamps. 
It wasn't long before I was in jail. 
Now wasn't I on the side of righteousness? 
So, what was I doing in jail? 
What I was doing, let me advise you was fixing to shoot some motherfuckers in that hospital. 
That's what I was doing. 
But you know what? 
It was like they read my mind and they kept me in that jail until my mind was turned around. 
When I got out, I only wanted to see my baby and my wife. 
And I started thinking to myself what happened is the way things are. 
So why try and buck the system? 
This is what I'm gonna do. 
I'm gonna break up the squad, send you in different directions. 
- I think this is- - 
- No, you don't think. 
You'd best just relax and try to forget about this thing. 
You can't expect anything else in the combat zone. 
Is that clear? 
Sir. 
Yes, sir. 
I got some boneless chicken I'll trade for some pound cake. 
- We'd kill to keep our pound cake. 
- Everybody says that. 
In fact, we have killed to keep our pound cake. 
If you was me, what would you have done? 
What do you mean, man? 
I mean, if you were me, what would you have done? 
I don't know. 
There was this one minute, you know? 
I had this chance. 
I could have got her out of there. 
We both could have taken off. 
And then Clark- 
- What was I supposed to do? 
Waste a corporal? 
- No, man. 
- Just blow away four Americans? 
- No. - What then? 
Guys, I can't find my squad. 
Why are you here? 
- I can't find Wilkins. 
- Find any pound cake? 
- No, just chicken. 
- Where is yours? 
Somebody stole it. 
Can I stay with you? 
Yeah, back there. 
I should have gone to Captain Hill. 
He'd straighten this out. 
When we reconnoitre to those caves, do you think- - 
Private, move out. 
- You told Reilly? 
- Reilly's bullshit. 
No, I gotta see Captain Hill. 
He'll square this shit away. 
Don't go around your immediate superior. 
If I do nothing, she'd just vanish. 
There's a chain of command. 
I wouldn't violate something so sacred for a murder. 
What are you talking about? 
Don't worry about it. 
I better go. 
I feel like I'm doing something wrong. 
I'll see you later. 
You won't see us later if you don't stop bopping around here. 
Just take it easy, okay? 
Slow down. 
Tough. 
There he goes. 
- Pathetic. 
- He ain't rendezvoused with his brain- - 
Cease fire! 
Cease fire! 
What's the haps, sarge? 
Booby trap. 
Somebody stepped on a toe-popper. 
All right, let's move it out. 
- Who got hit, sarge? 
- Cherry. That boy was bagged the minute they sent him here. 
They should have just shot him at home. 
Okay, let's move out. 
Get your people out of here. 
Oh, Jesus! 
Pathetic, dumb-ass Cherry. 
Wait a minute. 
This goddamn thing is turning us on our heads. 
We're getting it backwards. 
Because every day is a dose of bullshit. 
Just because we could all be blown away everybody's acting like we can do anything. 
And it don't matter what we do. 
But I think it's the other way around. 
The main thing is the opposite. 
Because we might die in the next second maybe we gotta be extra careful what we do. 
Because maybe it matters more. 
Maybe it matters more than we even know. 
- PFC Eriksson reporting, sir. 
- At ease, Eriksson. 
Captain Hill, something happened- - 
I'm aware of why you're here. 
Lt. Reilly detailed it to me just after you brought it to him. 
I didn't know that, sir. 
That just about cover it, trooper? 
I am max-attentive to this situation. 
Yes, sir. 
Is there someone I should speak to? 
Has the investigation started? 
I hope you understand how serious this situation is. 
Yes, sir. 
That's why I reported it, sir. 
This could cause a major international incident. 
Do you know that? 
Yes, sir. 
These men fucked up good but you bringing formal charges against them is that gonna help that girl one little bit? 
Maybe if you had been there, sir. 
If you heard her scream- - 
Don't tell me shit about screaming! 
I've heard a lot of fucking screaming! 
Most of it's come from wounded American boys. 
I'm gonna transfer you out of my company. 
That okay? 
I'll get you out of the bush, any fucking place you want to go. 
I saw your 201 file in the rear. 
You volunteered to be a tunnel rat. 
Is that what you want? 
I want out of this company. 
Well, that's a rog. You're a tunnel rat. 
It won't keep me from bringing this out. 
Nobody's trying to keep you from doing a goddamn thing. 
My function here is just to tell you how this will come down. 
And you ought to be advised that military court-martials are lenient. 
And stateside review boards are even more lenient. 
If these guys get convicted they won't do any real time. 
Yes, sir. 
They'll be out of the stockade before you know it. 
And if I was them, I'd be pissed off. 
I'd be looking for payback! 
Now, a man like you, wife, baby daughter I'd be considering those factors very carefully. 
Pardon me, sir. 
What's your point, sir? 
There ain't no point, Eriksson. 
I'm just illuminating the terrain in which we find ourselves deployed. 
You don't mind. 
And if you do, fuck you! 
- You on my frequency? 
- Yes, sir. 
You maggot! 
Who do you think you are? 
You recommended Meserve for a Bronze Star! 
He pulled you out of a VC tunnel, boy! 
What he did was wrong. 
But he's a kid. 
He's 20 goddamn years old! 
And you're gonna ruin his life? 
He saved yours! 
No, man, no! 
Now listen to me, man. 
Just don't get too happy with those dice. 
- I'll be there in two seconds. 
- Okay. All right. 
Hey, Clarkie! 
What? 
- Charlie's in the wire! - What the hell's going on? 
Christ! 
What was it? 
Who was on watch? 
Anybody still in there? 
Get that fire out over there. 
You sick son of a bitch! 
I told you, cherry. 
What happens- - 
Nobody cares, Meserve. 
Oh, I told everybody. 
You don't have to worry. 
You don't have to kill me. 
I told them, and they don't care! 
You dinky dau, man. 
You beaucoup dinky dau! 
How you doing, son? 
Sir. 
I'm sorry, sir. 
Drunk, sir. 
Mind if I join you? 
Drunk. 
Very drunk, sir. 
You going on leave? 
Getting transferred, sir. Fini boonies. 
This little darling must be your daughter. 
You're not gonna do anything crazy with that gun, are you? 
Just protecting myself, sir. 
I gotta protect myself. 
Trouble at home, son? 
Pardon, sir? 
I thought maybe you had problems at home, sickness in the family. 
The answer's not in that can, son. 
Are you sure, sir? 
I'm a chaplain. 
Try me. That's what I do. 
You a chaplain, sir? 
Are you religious, son? 
I'm a Methodist. 
I'm a Lutheran. 
We can still talk, can't we? 
I went on a long-range patrol, sir. 
And we kidnapped a girl from a village. 
And the other four men raped her. 
And they murdered her. 
And I failed, sir to stop them. 
Couldn't let it rest, could you? 
You had to push it. 
Go to hell. 
Sir! 
So you don't feel responsible for the rape and murder? 
No, sir. I don't. 
Is it your feeling, Corporal Clark that you are wrongly brought to trial by the U.S. Government? 
I don't have anything against the government. 
But I just think soldiers like Tony Meserve and me belong out in combat not here. 
Throw us in the stockade and you're helping nobody but the Viet Cong. 
When Sergeant Meserve called you, did you go willingly into the hootch and rape the girl Tran Thi Oahn? 
Please answer the question. 
Yes, sir. 
Yes, sir. 
Have you any idea why Eriksson stayed out of the hootch? 
Well, he was brand-new, sir. 
I was there a lot longer than him. 
At least three weeks longer than him. 
You're saying, then you involved yourself in rape to avoid being ridiculed? 
When you go out on a patrol, sir you're not gonna be as good as you wanna be. 
These guys aren't helping you do anything. 
There's gonna be four people on that patrol, and an individual. 
And so I did what I did, and I got remorse about it. 
But I also got remorse about talking at this trial. 
I have a loyalty to the men I was out there with. 
Is it standard for U.S. personnel to have sex with prisoners and kill them? 
- Objection! 
- Overruled. 
The prisoner tried to give away the squad's position. 
She was ill and coughing from the abuse of you and your men. 
She shouldn't have been there to jeopardize your position! 
You dragged her out and raped her! 
And then you blame her for coughing, so you kill her! 
- Does that about sum it up? 
- Objection. 
Well, sir I've seen a lot of killing which it's our duty to do, because it's kill or be killed. 
Sometimes you hate the enemy so badly.... 
About two ops back Operation Turner we saw a hootch that had been burned down. 
Some Vietnamese were carrying kids out of a bunker. 
They suffered from smoke inhalation. 
I gave one small child mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 
That just shows you we ain't all combat over here. 
Of the charges of rape and unpremeditated murder PFC Diaz is found guilty sentenced to eight years' hard labour. 
Of the charge of rape, PFC Hatcher is found guilty and sentenced to 15 years' hard labour. 
Of the charges of rape and premeditated murder Corporal Clark is found guilty sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labour. 
Of the charge of unpremeditated murder Sergeant E5 Meserve is found guilty sentenced to 10 years' hard labour. 
Sentences will begin immediately at Disciplinary Barracks, Ft. 
Prisoners dismissed. 
If these guys get convicted, they won't do any real time. 
They'll be out of the stockade before you know it. 
And if I was them, I'd be pissed off. 
I'd be looking for payback! 
Excuse me. 
Excuse me, miss! 
- You forgot this. - Oh! Thank you. 
Bye. 
Do I remind you of someone? 
Yeah. 
You had a bad dream, didn't you? 
Yes. 
It's over now, I think. 
- Oh, this is great! - Wow! 
Oh, that ´ s incredible. 
There ´ s got to be seven or eight feet up there. 
- And eighty years of dust. 
- Oh, look at all this height. 
We could put our bedroom upstairs, and get all this space. 
- For what? 
- Just space. 
One! 
Two! 
Three! 
- And four? 
- Come on. 
And five? 
- Watch, watch! 
- God, this place is huge. 
- It ´ s beautiful. 
- God! 
- You guys, it ´ s absolutely incredible. 
- Incredible. 
- A little paint. 
- Sell it tomorrow, double your money. 
Carl, you ´ re obsessed. 
A little bit. 
Wow, look! 
Hey, it ´ s an Indian Head penny. 
1898. 
It ´ s a good omen. 
You ´ re the good omen. 
Oh, it ´ s so great! 
I had Rose move your 3 o ´ clock with Bob Kahan to 4 o ´ clock. 
Gary Alan called. 
He has to see you about the painting bids for the loft. 
3 o ´ clock is the only time he can make it. 
Is that OK? 
Sam? 
- I ´ m sorry. - Relax, man. 
You ´ re not having brain surgery. 
Pitching these Japanese guys makes me so nervous. 
Sam, you ´ re going to be great. 
What am I supposed to say? 
I can ´ t really tell them my Swedish girl joke. 
Great. 
Where did you get those? Molly. 
What do you think? 
Are they me? 
- Oh, man. 
Look at that, a Testarossa. - Wow... 
- Ouch! 
- Pay off your Mustang first. 
How are you? 
What did the doctor say? 
He said that it was contagious. 
That it was really... 
- No? 
- Yeah. 
I shouldn ´ t even be coming in today. 
What about the rash? 
The rash? 
The rash is also incredibly contagious. 
- He said they ´ ve both been spreading. 
- No? 
On your genitals again? 
Yeah, yeah, right on the genitals. 
Basically everywhere. 
He said that I shouldn ´ t touch anyone. 
Excuse me, I ´ m sorry. 
- You ´ re sick! 
- I know. 
- Morning, Paul. 
- Morning, Carl. 
Save it, Paul. 
- Morning, Mr Wheat. 
- Susie. 
You ´ re looking good. 
- Sam. 
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
- Here it is. 
- Thanks. 
- Morning, Sam. 
- Morning, Rose. 
- Listen, the Kobiashi people... 
- They ´ re already here. 
- They ´ re early! 
- I know. 
- Come here! 
- Andy Dillon called... 
- How long have they been here? 
- Ten minutes. 
Andy Dillon called. 
He needs $ 900,000 transferred to Albany by ten. 
- By ten? - Yes. 
- Carl? - Yeah. 
Carl... 
Dillon needs 900,000 in Albany by ten. 
Can you transfer it to his account? 
- Yes, but I need your MAC code. 
- OK. 
- Discretion, right? 
- Got it. 
- You bet. I ´ ll do it right now. 
- Thanks. 
Bill, I ´ ll call you back. 
OK, that ´ s fine. 
That ´ s fine. 
This is too far out. 
Can you get this, man? 
Are you guys from the New York City Ballet? 
Almost... 
- Saved your life! - You shit. 
Why do you scare me to death? 
It ´ s better than seeing this gorgeous body splattered all over the place. 
Look out! 
- Grab it! 
- Sam, Moll! 
Are you guys home? 
- Did you invite Carl? 
- Slave labour. 
- Carl! 
- Hurry, help! 
- Oh, my God. 
- Grab the bottom. 
- Now, go there. 
- Right here? 
- Watch your toes. 
- Where do you want this? 
- God, this place looks great! 
- You like it, huh? 
Like is hardly the word. 
I had no idea it would be this beautiful. 
It ´ s incredible. 
- What about her? 
- Leave her until the other stuff is here. 
- What are these? 
- Oh, let me show you. 
Will you help me lift this up? 
- Just finished it. 
What do you think? 
Sam, what ´ s this chair doing here? 
- I love that chair. 
- I know, but we discussed this. 
I ´ ve had it forever. 
- When I watch TV, I sit in it. 
- This chair is ugly. 
- And it doesn ´ t go with anything. 
- It goes with me. 
You ´ re right, it does. 
- We ´ ll paint it. 
- We ´ ll what? 
Are you OK? 
I ´ m fine. 
What ´ s the matter? 
Nothing. 
Are you worried about the promotion? 
No, not really. 
Then what - moving in together? 
No. 
I don ´ t know. 
It ´ s a lot of things. 
I just don ´ t want the bubble to burst. 
It seems like..... whenever anything good in my life happens, I ´ m afraid I ´ m going to lose it. 
I love you. 
I really love you. 
Ditto. 
The pilot ´ s first report of trouble was he blew the number two engine... 
Oh, Jesus. 
Another one? 
Don ´ t watch that. 
I should cancel my LA trip. 
These things always happen in threes. 
Sam, get serious! 
- Besides, you lead a charmed life. 
- Yeah, so did they. 
It ´ s amazing. 
Just like that... 
Blackout. 
I couldn ´ t sleep. 
Boy... 
I really must have passed out. 
- What time is it? 
- It ´ s 2 am. 
Oh, no! 
I hope it wasn ´ t a masterpiece. 
Well, it ´ s not now. 
- Can I help? - Yeah. 
Put your hands here... 
Now get them wet. 
Let the clay slide between your fingers. 
Oh, no. 
- What ´ s the matter? 
- A glitch. 
What ´ s up? 
The Greenberg and White accounts, I can ´ t get in. 
The code doesn ´ t work. 
- I changed it. 
- Why? 
- I just want to nose around a bit. 
- Is something wrong? Can you keep a secret? 
Yeah, sure. 
What ´ s up? 
There ´ s too much money in these accounts. 
That ´ s impossible. 
Sam, this is going to take you hours. 
Let me do this. 
- It already has taken me hours. 
- Let me figure it out for you. 
No, it ´ s OK. 
It ´ s like a vendetta now. 
Thanks, though, I appreciate it. 
- If you start to go blind, give a shout. 
- OK. Adiós. 
Listen, what are you and Moll doing tonight? 
We ´ re going to the theatre. 
She wants to see Macbeth. 
I think she likes the guys in tights. 
- You want to go? - No. 
I want a full report, though. 
- Later. 
- Yeah. 
Well, I loved it. 
I was spellbound the whole time. 
I could tell, and so could the rest of the audience, with that snore of yours. 
- Did I tell you what Marcia said? 
- About six times. 
It wasn ´ t six times. 
Quit being so blasé about this. 
This was really important. 
I ´ m going to have two pieces in her gallery. 
The New York Times reviews her gallery all the time. 
The New York Times is a frustrated critic with pimples on his ass who flunked art school. 
Who cares what they think? 
About 8 million readers, that ´ s who. 
No, they ´ re just reading the sports page. 
Your work is really beautiful. 
It shouldn ´ t matter what anyone else thinks, just what I think. 
- I want to marry you, Sam. 
- What? 
- What? 
- Yeah, I ´ ve been thinking about it. 
I ´ ve been thinking about it a lot. 
I think we should just do it. 
- Are you serious? 
- Yeah. 
What ´ s that look for? 
You never wanted to talk about it. 
- Do you love me, Sam? 
- What do you think? 
- Why don ´ t you ever say it? 
- What do you mean? 
- I say it all the time. 
- You say" ditto." That ´ s not the same. 
People say" l love you" all the time, and it doesn ´ t mean anything. 
Sometimes you need to hear it. 
I need to hear it. 
Let ´ s go! 
- What should we do? - Let me handle it. 
- What do you want? 
- Your wallet! 
Sam, just give it to him. 
Just take the money. 
Just leave... 
No! 
Sam! 
You son of a bitch! 
Somebody help us! 
Somebody! 
Somebody help us! 
Stop it, Sam! 
Molly? 
Molly! 
You got...? 
Oh, baby, hold on. 
You ´ re going to be OK. 
Somebody? 
Somebody! 
Somebody help us! 
Oh, my God! 
Oh, Sam, come on. 
Come on, baby. 
You ´ re going to be OK. 
Somebody? 
Somebody help me! 
Please, anybody! 
OK, lady, take it easy. 
We ´ ll help you. 
Molly? 
Molly? 
Molly! 
What shall we do? 
What ´ s happening? 
Is he breathing? 
Oh, goddamn, hold on. 
Here we go. 
Sam, don ´ t you leave me! 
Hold on! 
If you would just step this way. 
- So, what happened to you? 
- What? You ´ re new, huh? 
I can tell. 
- Are you talking to me? 
- Relax, it ain ´ t like before. 
It ´ s a whole new ball of wax. 
- Who are you? 
- I ´ m waiting for my wife. 
She ´ s in the cardiac wing. 
She ´ s fighting it. 
Shot? 
That ´ ll do it every time. 
Poor bastard. 
You may as well get used to it - you could be here for a long while. 
I ´ ll tell you a secret. 
Doors ain ´ t as bad as you think. 
Zip-zap - ain ´ t nothing at all. 
You ´ ll see. 
You ´ ll catch on. 
He ain ´ t going to make it. 
I ´ ve seen it a million times - he ´ s a goner. 
You see? 
Here they come. 
Lucky bastard! 
It could have been the other ones. 
You never know. 
Who are they? 
No! 
God help me! 
Help me! 
" l am sunk in the abysmal swamp where there is no foothold. 
" l have reached the watery depths. 
The flood overwhelms me. 
" l am wearied with calling." 
As we say farewell to our friend, Sam Wheat, we are reminded of his kindness, his generosity, his buoyancy of spirit. 
All that we treasure, our loved ones, our friends, our body..... our mind, are but on loan to us. 
We must surrender them all. 
We are all travellers on the same road, which leads to the same end. 
As our loved one enters eternal life, 
let us remember that love, too, is eternal. 
That although we will miss him, our love will light the void and dispel the darkness. 
I picked up your shirts today. 
I don ´ t know why. 
Mr Reynolds told me to tell you" hello." 
I broke into tears. 
It ´ s like I think about you every minute. 
It ´ s like I can still feel you. 
I ´ m here, Moll. 
What ´ s the matter, kitty? 
What ´ s the matter? 
Crazy cat. 
Sam? 
It ´ s really stupid. 
I love this picture. 
It ´ s great. 
Let me see that! 
Sam ´ s address book. 
- Dave Brubeck, should I toss them? 
- No. 
No? 
Molly, we hated that concert. 
You wanted to save those? 
Rolaids? 
Molly, what are you doing? 
I just miss him, Carl. 
Me, too. 
Carl? 
Wait a minute. 
Not that one. 
I ´ m sorry. 
I didn ´ t mean to put that on there. 
Hey, Moll. 
Why don ´ t you come? 
- It ´ s like summer outside. 
- No. I ´ m really not up for it. 
- It would be good for you to get out. 
- I don ´ t want to. 
You can ´ t stay in here all day. 
It ´ s not healthy. 
I can ´ t do it! 
You ´ re not the one who died. 
- I ´ m sorry. 
- Don ´ t apologise. 
Shit! 
- Maybe you ´ re right. 
Just a short one. 
- That a girl! 
I ´ m sorry. 
Molly? 
What are you doing here? 
You bastard! 
You son of a bitch! 
What do you want? 
Molly? 
Molly, get out! 
No, Molly! 
No, please? 
He ´ s got a gun, Molly! 
Hi, kitty. 
You hurt her, I ´ ll... 
Shit! 
Is somebody there? 
Hello? 
Let go! 
What are you doing? 
Like trains? 
Stay out! 
This is mine. 
Shit! 
It ´ s me. 
I couldn ´ t get it. 
She came home. 
Give me a couple of days. 
I ´ ll go back. 
Relax. 
I ´ ll get it. 
Get what? 
Who are you? 
What do you want from us? 
No. 
You stay away from her! 
Do you hear me? 
You stay away from her! 
Rosa Santiago? 
Please be seated. 
Our sister will be with us soon. 
Sister Oda Mae, grant us the gift of your all-seeing presence. 
Appear before us now. 
Mrs Santiago? 
- Buenos días. 
- I ´ m Oda Mae Brown. 
You wish to contact your husband. 
I believe he ´ ll be with us today. 
Thank you. 
But you know, Mrs Santiago, there ´ s no telling about that other world, so you ´ ve got to be a believer. 
Are you a believer? 
Sí, I believe, I believe. 
Then let us begin. 
I can ´ t. 
It ´ s too difficult. I just can ´ t seem to make contact. 
No - wait! 
I ´ m feeling something. 
Did he know someone by the name of Anna? 
Consuelo? 
Lucita? 
Julietta? 
Josephina? 
Linda? Maria? 
Sí, sí! 
His Mama, she is Maria. 
Yes! Praise God. 
I knew he was with his Mama. 
Oh, my God... 
It ´ s too difficult. 
It ´ s two of them - I ´ m not sure I can do that. 
I pay more! 
How much? 
- How much? - Twenty dollars. 
Way to go. 
Milk her for every penny. 
Yes. 
I believe we can start again. 
Praise the Lord! 
Thank you, Jesus. 
Welcome, Mrs Santiago. 
You are fortunate, the spirits are churning. 
- My husband? 
- Mercy! Oh, yeah, where? 
- Julio? 
- Yes. I feel his vibration. 
- I see him. 
- How is he? 
How does he look? 
He ´ s a handsome man. 
Handsome? 
Mrs Santiago, in our Father ´ s Kingdom, we ´ re all handsome. 
Oh, Julio. 
Julio is coming towards us. 
I see him! 
He ´ s coming. 
He ´ s there. 
He ´ s dressed in a black suit. 
Black suit? 
- Could be blue. 
- What a crock of shit. 
Who is that? 
Where are you? 
Did you hear it? 
Where are you? 
- Who are you? 
- You can hear me? 
- Can ´ t you hear him? 
I don ´ t believe this. 
My name is Sam Wheat. 
Can you hear me? 
- Say my name," Sam Wheat." 
- Talk to me, Oda Mae. 
- Sam Wheat. 
- Jesus...! 
- Sam Wheat? 
I swear, no more cheating. 
I ´ ll do anything, just make that guy go away. 
No way. 
It ´ s OK. 
- All right, sister? 
- Yeah, you ´ re all right. 
My mother had it, and her mother. 
They both had the gift. 
They always said I had it, but I never did, I never had it. 
They told me all about it, but now that I ´ ve got it, I don ´ t think I want it. 
Just go away. 
Find somebody else. 
- You ´ re out of your mind. 
- I ´ m getting there fast. 
She hit her head hard. 
She was talking to somebody before that. 
Sister can do that. 
- Where exactly are you? 
- Standing right beside you. 
- You ´ re standing right beside me? 
- Honey, we ´ re right here! 
- Are you white? 
- What? 
- White? 
- You ´ re white, aren ´ t you? 
- You know what? 
- I ´ m calling the doctor. 
- I knew it, a white guy! 
Why me? 
- You ´ re going to help me. 
There ´ s a woman who is in terrible danger. 
The man who killed me is going back to our apartment. 
You ´ ve got to warn her. 
- Why would she listen to me? 
- It ´ s just a phone call. 
Look..... you ´ re all I ´ ve got. 
I ´ m not leaving until you help me. I don ´ t care how long it takes, because I can talk forever. 
- Hello. 
- Hi, is this Molly Jensen? 
My name is Oda Mae Brown, I ´ m a spiritual advisor. 
I have a message for you. 
It sounds crazy, but it ´ s not. 
You ´ ve got to believe me, don ´ t be afraid. 
- Who is this? - I ´ ve got a message from Sam. 
- What? 
- Sam Wheat asked me to call. 
- I told you! 
- You ´ ve got to go there. 
I ´ m not going anywhere. 
I ´ m Henry the Eighth, I am Henry the Eighth I am, I am 
I got married to the widow next door, she ´ s been married seven times before 
Henry the Eighth I am, I am Henry the Eighth I am 
Second verse, same as the first I ´ m Henry the Eighth, I am Henry the Eighth I am, I am 
- I got married to the widow next door. 
- All right! 
Stop singing. 
I ´ ll go anywhere you want to, just don ´ t sing any more. 
I can ´ t believe I ´ m doing this. 
What am I doing here? 
I hate downtown! 
She ´ s probably not even there. 
Which building is it? 
Push 3. 
- See, nobody ´ s there. 
- Just wait. 
I did everything I said I would. 
She ´ s not there. 
I ´ m going. 
I ´ m sorry. All right, don ´ t sing. 
- Hello? 
- Hi... She can ´ t hear you. 
I called you last night about your friend, Sam Wheat. 
Hey, Molly. 
I know you ´ re up there. 
I know you hear me. 
Sam wants to talk to you. 
This is for real! 
Remember the starfish at Montego Bay? 
How would I know that? 
I know about the underwear you wrote your name on! 
I won ´ t forget that. 
I know about the picture in Reno. 
Hey, Molly! 
The sweater she knitted, in the closet, that ´ s too big. 
He just told me about the sweater that you knitted that ´ s too big. 
Four sizes. 
- Do you hear me? 
- I hear you! 
- Nobody ´ s talking to you. 
- Hear of the phone? 
Want to kiss my butt? 
- I won ´ t stay here all day. 
Oh, shut up! 
Molly, I ´ m going to count to three, and then I ´ m out of here. 
One-two-three. 
- No, wait. 
- No. 
It ´ s Molly. 
Molly? 
I ´ m Oda Mae Brown. 
I don ´ t know you or Sam, but let me tell you what he did. 
He kept me up all night singing" l ´ m Henry the Eighth, I am." 
That ´ s how he got me to go out with him. 
Look, I ´ m sorry. 
I just don ´ t believe in this life after death stuff. 
- Tell her she ´ s wrong. 
- He says you ´ re wrong. 
- You ´ re talking to him right now? 
- Yeah. He asked me to tell you that you ´ re wrong. 
- Where is he? 
- I can ´ t see him, I can only hear him. 
- I ´ m right here. 
- That doesn ´ t help, Sam. 
- I ´ m holding her hand. 
- He says he ´ s holding your hand. 
What are you doing? 
What do you think you ´ re doing to me? 
If you think I ´ m here for my health, you ´ re crazy. 
Sam ´ s dead. 
He ´ s dead. 
- Tell her I love her. - He says he loves you. 
Sam would never say that. 
- Tell her" ditto." 
- What is" ditto"? 
Ditto! 
I don ´ t know how I ´ m doing this. 
Confidentially - nothing like this has ever happened to me before. 
Now I can ´ t turn it off. 
- Is this him? 
ls this you? 
- Yeah. 
Cute! 
White, but cute. 
What I don ´ t understand is, why did he come back? 
- I don ´ t know. 
- Why ´ s he still here? 
He ´ s stuck, he ´ s in between worlds. 
Sometimes the spirit gets yanked out so quick, the essence still feels it has work to do. 
- Stop rambling. 
- I ´ m not, I ´ m answering a question. 
- He ´ s got an attitude. 
- I don ´ t. 
Yes, you do. We ´ re having a little discussion. 
If you didn ´ t, you wouldn ´ t have raised your voice. 
- Oh, goddammit... 
- Don ´ t take the Lord ´ s name in vain. 
- Would you relax? 
- You ´ re the dead guy. 
If you want me to help, you ´ d better apologise. 
That ´ s it, I ´ m leaving. 
Nobody talks to me like that. 
- Now, you ´ d better apologise. 
- I ´ m sorry. 
I apologise. 
OK? Now would you sit down? 
- Please? 
- He ´ s apologised. 
I need you to tell Molly what I ´ m saying, but you have to tell her word for word, all right? 
Yes. He wants me to tell you what he ´ s saying word for word. 
- Molly, you ´ re in danger. 
- You can ´ t blurt it out like that! 
Quit moving around - you ´ re making me dizzy. 
I ´ ll tell her in my own way. 
Molly, you ´ re in danger, girl. 
- What are you talking about? 
- He knows the man who killed him. 
His name is Willie Lopez, and I know where he lives. 
His name is Willie Lopez, and he knows where he lives. - Write it down. 
- I ain ´ t no secretary! 
Just do it! 
He ´ s so testy! 
- What do I write? 
- It ´ s 303, Prospect Place, apt. 
4D. 303 Prospect Place? 
- It ´ s my neighbourhood. 
- Molly, he ´ s got my wallet, he ´ s got my key, and he was in here. 
- He was in here. 
- Yesterday, when you came back, you went upstairs, you talked to Floyd... 
When you came back he was here. 
He saw everything. 
Molly, go to the police. 
It was a set-up. 
I was murdered. 
He says go to the police. 
It was a set-up, he was murdered. 
- Somebody else is involved. 
- Forget it. 
I don ´ t want this. 
- Where are you going? 
- I ´ m leaving. I did everything I said I would. 
Don ´ t follow me, because I ´ m finished. 
Have a nice life, have a nice death, goodbye. 
There ´ s no one on earth who ´ d want this to be true more than me. 
You ´ ve got to be rational about this. 
Sam is no more in this room than... 
I understand the need to hang on to him, I really do. 
- But this is absurd! 
- It seems absurd, but it had to be real. 
How could you believe a fortune-teller from Brooklyn? 
- I watched them have a conversation. 
- I don ´ t buy it, not for a minute. 
- What about the things she knew? 
The photo Sam took of me on our trip to Reno. 
We were alone. 
And the green underwear that I wrote my name in. 
She said Sam knew who killed him. 
- That he was set up. 
- This is getting deranged. 
- She had a name and an address. 
- Good, Molly... Willie Lopez, 303 Prospect Place, apt. 
- This is sick. 
Molly, I don ´ t understand how you could..... swallow this crap. 
This guy may not even exist. 
Maybe she ´ s using you to set someone up. 
You ´ re right. 
You ´ re absolutely right. 
- That ´ s what I ´ ve got to find out. 
- How are you going to do that? 
She said Sam wants me to go to the police. 
Sam wants you to go to the police? 
Jesus, Moll...! 
What are you going to tell them? 
That some storefront psychic lady has been communing with the dead? 
Do you know how that sounds? 
You ´ re talking ghosts here! 
I ´ m sorry, this really gets to me. 
- It ´ s OK if you don ´ t believe me. 
- I ´ m trying to, Molly. 
Look..... if it ´ ll make you feel any better, I ´ ll go check this out. 
I want you to try and get some sleep. 
OK? 
I ´ ll call you in the morning. 
Be careful! 
Carl! 
What the hell are you doing here? 
- Who have you been talking to? 
- What do you mean? 
Some woman knows all about you. 
Where ´ s she getting it from? 
- I haven ´ t said a word to anybody. 
- She knows your name and address. 
- How do women know where I live? 
- She knows about the murder! 
Now, I want you to find this bitch, whoever she is, and I want you to... 
Just get rid of her, OK? 
I ´ ve got 4 million dollars stuffed in a goddamn computer. 
If I don ´ t get those codes, if that money is not transferred soon..... l ´ m... dead. 
We ´ re both dead. 
Tell them you only launder money on the first of the month. 
What the hell is wrong with you? 
ls everything a joke? 
You killed a man. 
You were supposed to steal his wallet. 
I did you a favour, man, that was a freebie. 
Look, these are drug dealers, OK? 
Just don ´ t blow this for me, Willie. 
I ´ d lose my job, go to jail. 
$ 80,000 of that money is mine. 
Let me have the keys to Sam ´ s apartment, 
You goddamn bastard! 
Why? 
You were my friend! I had a life, goddamn you! 
I had a life! 
I don ´ t even believe in this stuff myself. 
But she was real. 
Do you think I ´ d come here if it wasn ´ t real? 
You told me if I had any new information, that I should come. 
So, here I am. 
I know how this sounds. 
I hear myself saying it, and I want to cringe. 
But she knew things she couldn ´ t have known. Things Sam only said to me. 
According to this psychic lady, there are ghosts and spirits all over the place? 
Watching us all the time? 
I ´ m never going to get undressed again. Excuse me. 
I ´ ve got more important things to do. 
The guy ´ s name is Willie Lopez. 
All I ´ m asking is for you to check it out. 
OK. 
You wait here and let me see if the guy ´ s got a record. 
Right. 
- Where ´ s the file on Willie Lopez? - There ´ s no file for Willie Lopez. 
He was probably some old boyfriend she was trying to get even with. 
This psychic woman ´ s got a long record. 
1 967, Shreveport. 
Forgery, selling of false ID. 
Served one year in 1 971. 
Arrested for fraud, numbers racketeering, served ten months, 1 974. 
- Look, this is impossible! 
- It goes on and on. 
She knew things - private things. 
How could she have known all that? 
A lot of times they read the obits. 
All she had to do was see the word" banker." Boom. 
They even go through your garbage to find things they can use. 
Letters, old papers. 
It doesn ´ t take much. 
No. 
It was real. 
She knew about a sweater I knitted. 
And songs we sang. 
The trip to Montego Bay. 
I ´ m sorry. 
I know this is hard. 
People want so much to believe. 
They ´ re grieving, they ´ re vulnerable. 
And they will give anything for one last moment. 
Believe me, these people know what they ´ re doing. 
I know how you must feel, but you know you can press charges. 
No. 
Thank you. 
Oh, God, let this be it. 
Yes! 
- Hello. 
- Eddie, it ´ s Carl Bruner. 
Everything ´ s fine. 
We ´ re all set. 
What do you want me to do? 
I want you to transfer the money into a single account under the name" Rita Miller." 
Tomorrow, at five minutes before closing, 3.55 pm, transfer the full account to the First lsland Bank ofNassau, registry number 486-9580. 
- Call us when it ´ s done. 
- OK, I ´ ve got it. 
Just tell Mr Balistrari that there won ´ t be any more problems, OK. 
Yeah, I ´ ll do that. 
Good work. 
Molly, why can ´ t you hear me? 
I need you. 
- Who is it? 
- It ´ s Carl, Molly. 
No, don ´ t open the goddamn door! 
He ´ s a murderer. 
Listen, I know it ´ s late. 
I ´ m sorry to disturb you. 
I ´ ve been thinking about you all day. 
I feel really lousy about last night. 
- This supernatural thing... 
- Don ´ t worry about it, really. It ´ s OK. 
It ´ s not. 
You needed me to hear you, and I didn ´ t. 
I wasn ´ t there for you, and that was wrong. 
It ´ s just... 
I just... 
I want you to know that I ´ m your friend. 
- Thanks, Carl. 
- You were never her friend. 
- That means a lot to me. 
- Me, too. 
I ´ ve brought you some Japanese apple pears. 
- Thanks, that ´ s very sweet. 
- Could I come in for a second? 
I won ´ t stay long, it ´ s just been one of those days. 
- Yeah, come on in. 
- No, Molly. 
You seem a little tense. 
Are you OK? 
No, I ´ m fine. 
It ´ s just... 
What can I tell you? 
It ´ s been tough. 
It still hurts so much. 
- You lying snake! 
- On top of it, there ´ s stuff at work. 
They ´ ve given me my own accounts, which is good. 
But I just haven ´ t really had time to adjust, to absorb everything. 
It ´ s no big deal. 
- Can I have a little more cream? - Yeah. 
Oh, shit! 
Jesus, I can ´ t believe I did that. 
- Are you all right? - I ´ m fine. 
- Let me throw that in the washer. 
- Don ´ t worry about it. 
It ´ s OK. 
- Can I get you another shirt? 
- No, it ´ ll dry in a minute. 
Where were you today? 
I thought you were coming into the bank. 
I was supposed to, but I didn ´ t have time. 
I went to the police. 
You did? 
What did you tell them? 
What did they say? 
It was awful. 
I felt really stupid. 
They brought out a file on this woman at least ten inches thick. 
- Rip-off artist, huh? 
- No, Molly! 
You know, the sad thing is that I believed her. 
Molly..... sometimes we need to believe. 
What ´ s the point? 
It ´ s not easy to face the realities of life. 
Sometimes you ´ ve got to give yourself that. 
You ´ ve got to remember the love you guys felt. 
That ´ s real. 
Remember how good Sam was, how much he loved you. 
You were everything to him, Molly. 
You were his life. 
I feel so alone. 
You ´ re not alone, OK. 
You ´ ve got your work - you ´ re talented. 
You ´ re young. 
You ´ re fantastically gorgeous. 
I don ´ t know what ´ s real anymore. 
I don ´ t know what to think. 
Just think about Sam. 
Think about the time you two guys had together. 
How wonderful that was. 
Let your feelings out, it ´ s OK. 
Life turns on a dime. 
You know...? 
People think they ´ re forever, that there is always tomorrow. 
That ´ s bullshit. 
Sam taught us that. 
We have to live for now. 
For today. 
- I can ´ t. 
I ´ m sorry. 
- It ´ s OK. 
- I can ´ t, it ´ s just too soon. 
- It ´ s OK. 
You ´ ve been great, Carl. 
- But I need you to leave. 
- It ´ s OK, I understand. 
Please... 
Could we just have dinner tomorrow? 
- Yeah, sure. 
- Great. 
Hey! 
- Get off my train! 
- No. 
Get off! 
Get off! 
Get off! 
Get off! 
Get out of here! 
- Get off! 
- No. 
Show me how you do that. 
I ´ m not leaving till you teach me. 
Get off! 
You stubborn asshole! 
What the hell are you doing? 
You ´ re trying to move it with your fingers. 
You can ´ t push it with your finger. You ´ re dead. 
It ´ s all in your mind. 
Your problem is that you still think you ´ re real. 
You think you ´ re wearing those clothes? 
That you ´ re crouching there? 
Bullshit! 
You ain ´ t got a body no more. 
It ´ s all up here now. 
You want to move something, you ´ ve got to move it with your mind. 
Focus! 
- How? 
How do you focus? - I don ´ t know how you focus. 
You just focus. 
How did you do that? 
You take all of your emotions, all your anger, love, hate. 
Push it, down here into the pit of your stomach, and then let it explode, like a reactor. 
Don ´ t laugh! 
- Way to go, kid. 
- I did it! 
I did it! 
Way to go. 
From your gut, like I told you. 
Give it time. 
What else have you got? 
How long have you been here? 
Since they pushed me. 
- Someone pushed you? 
- Yeah. 
- Who? 
- You don ´ t believe me? 
You think I fell? 
You think I jumped? Well, fuck you! 
It wasn ´ t my time! 
I wasn ´ t supposed to go! 
I ´ m not supposed to be here. 
I ´ d give anything for a drag! 
- Just one drag. 
- Are you all right? 
Who are you? 
Why are you hounding me? 
Who sent you? 
Who sent you? 
Leave me alone! 
Concentrate, and you ´ ll probably rouse him. 
- What ´ s his name again? 
- Orlando. 
Orlando, Orlando. 
Is there an Orlando here? 
- I ´ m here. 
- He ´ s here. 
- Sam! 
- I ´ m Orlando. The line ´ s over there. 
Where did these ghosts come from? 
You can hear them, too? 
In the morning and in the evening. 
They come into the shower! 
Did you tell every spook in the world about me? 
I got spooks from Jersey. 
There ´ s stuff going on you wouldn ´ t believe. 
- It ´ s amazing. 
You ´ re really doing it! 
- Can you please hurry this up? 
Chill out! 
I need your help again. 
There ´ s something we need to do. 
I ´ m not doing anything else with you. 
You ´ re holding on to a life that doesn ´ t want you anymore. 
Give up the ghost. 
- Are you speaking to me? 
- Does it look like I ´ m speaking to you? 
You ´ re supposed to be concentrating. 
Are you going to try it? 
Are you going to get out? 
I ´ ve got work to do. 
Fine, then stay there. 
Excuse me, are you ready now? 
Let ´ s do it. 
Listen, I ´ ve got to talk to you now. 
I ´ ve got a plan. 
Oda Mae? 
Oda Mae? 
Ortisha. 
- Orlando! 
ls that you? 
- Where are you at? 
I can hardly see. 
- She ´ s here! 
- In front of you. 
Damn, baby, what did you do to your hair? 
Orlando, do you like it? 
It ´ s autumn sunrise. 
Get out of me, you son of a bitch! 
- Don ´ t ever do that to me again! 
- Orlando...? 
I can barely move. 
You should know better. 
Jumping into bodies wipes you out. 
- Everybody out! 
- What happened to Orlando? 
Are you deaf? 
I said everybody out! 
Everybody out! 
Get out, get out! 
Everybody get out! 
- Get out! 
- Are you the fortune-teller? 
- Who are you? 
- That ´ s an interesting question. 
- Why don ´ t you tell me? 
- Willie. 
Willie? 
- Prospect Place Willie? 
- Get out of here fast! 
I ´ m all right. 
- We ´ re in trouble. 
You have to help. 
- Who ´ s we? 
You ´ re already dead. 
- They ´ re trying to kill me! 
- And they ´ ll be back. 
Why don ´ t you find a house to haunt? 
Get some chains and rattle them. 
I have a plan. 
You ´ ve got to get some fake IDs. 
- Forget it. 
- If you do this, they ´ ll leave you alone. 
Scout ´ s honour. 
All right. 
What exactly do I have to do? 
Have you got a nice dress? 
- What ´ s wrong with my clothes? 
- I made a joke. I love your shoes. 
I ´ m going home. 
I don ´ t know anything about banking. 
I don ´ t know if it ´ ll work. 
- Just relax. 
- I ´ m nervous. 
I know you ´ re nervous, but I ´ ll get you through it. 
I don ´ t think I should do this. 
- We ´ re going to New Accounts. 
- I ´ m giving them no money! 
Do what I say, and don ´ t talk! 
You ´ re here to fill out a signature card for a new account. 
- Can I help you? - Yes. 
I ´ m here to fill out a card for a new account. 
- Do you know your account number? 
- 926-31 043. 
926-31 043. 
- Rita Miller. 
- What? 
Tell her Rita Miller. 
Didn ´ t you sign when you opened the account? 
Tell her Carl Bruner did it by phone. 
Carl Bruner opened that account for me by phone, and he ´ s asked me to come in today. 
- Is that right? 
- Yeah. 
Just sign this card on the bottom line, please. 
May I use your pen? 
No! 
Rita Miller! 
I ´ m so sorry. 
I need another one. I signed the wrong name. 
Tell her to send it up to the third floor file, you have a transaction to make. 
Make sure this goes to the third floor, I have a transfusion to make. 
Let ´ s go. 
You know what I mean...! 
Can I keep this pen? 
- Yes, sure. 
- Thank you so much. 
Bye-bye. 
I love these pens. 
What do you want to keep the pen for? 
Carl Bruner speaking. 
Mr Balistrari? 
Balistrari? 
It ´ s me, John. 
John... 
Sorry! 
What ´ s up? 
I ´ ve got the info on the Bradley portfolio. 
- I ´ ll pick it up later, all right? 
- I ´ ll be here till six. 
I couldn ´ t talk you into losing the hat? 
Keep messing with me, you ´ ll be here by yourself. 
You ´ re here to see Lyle Ferguson. 
- I ´ m here to see Lyle Ferguson. 
- Do you have an appointment? 
- No, I ´ m here for my health. 
- Tell him Rita Miller ´ s here! 
- Tell him Rita Miller ´ s here. 
- Just one moment, please. 
- Don ´ t embellish. 
- Jawohl! 
Excuse me? 
This guy Ferguson is a real jerk. 
I ´ ve known him five years. 
- Why are you whispering? 
- Just listen! 
He ´ s a social moron, you ´ ve got nothing to worry about. 
Tell the guard Ferguson knows you, from the Brewster ´ s Christmas party. 
What is this in regards to? 
He doesn ´ t remember me? 
We spent time at the Brewster ´ s, last Christmas. 
He and his lovely wife, Shirley. 
It was beautiful. 
A big old tree and presents... 
Gas! 
I get a little gas from time to time. 
- Quit poking me! 
- Well, don ´ t overdo it! 
Ferguson was so drunk, he could ´ ve met Tina Turner and not remember. 
Here we go! 
Hello. 
Of course. 
Well, it ´ s been a long time. 
- Oh, a long time. 
- Ask about Bobby and Snooky. 
- How are Bobby and Snooky? 
- Fine... fine. 
Thank you for asking. 
And how is your... 
-.. family? 
- Oh, couldn ´ t be better. 
Well, wonderful. 
Ask how they did on the Gibraltar Securities. 
I was wondering, how did you do on the Gibraltar Securities? 
Gibraltar Securities? 
Well, it looks like we topped out on that one. 
- We sure did. 
- That was a very useful tip. 
Good old Randy. 
Got a good head on his shoulders... her shoulders. 
- Her shoulders. 
- Randy. 
So, what brings you here today? 
I ´ m closing an account. 
Do you have your account number? 
- Yes? 
Yes. 
- 926 31 043. 
926..... 31 043. 
Is that right? 
Well, Rita - it looks like you ´ ll be withdrawing four million dollars. 
- Four million dollars! 
- Say yes. 
- Is that correct? - Yes. 
Yes. 
That ´ s correct. 
- How would you like that? 
- Tens and twenties. 
- Pardon? 
- Tell him a cashier ´ s cheque. 
- A cashier ´ s cheque. 
- Cashier ´ s cheque. 
Fine! 
Of course, you know we require identification. 
It ´ s a procedural thing. 
Thank you. 
I ´ ll be right back. 
Four million dollars! 
Get me the First lsland Bank of Nassau. It ´ s on the Rolodex. 
Now, we have some things for you to sign here. 
This officially closes the account. 
Miller - that ´ s my name. 
My name - Rita Miller. 
I ´ ll be right back. 
- Just anywhere? 
- Right here. 
Fine. 
The cheque..... here you are. 
Mama took the money from the oil wells, and she sunk it into gas pumps. 
And those gas stations have five or six of those things, so it ´ s lucrative. 
- Oda Mae, we ´ ve got to go. 
- Got to go now. 
It ´ s been a pleasure doing business. 
May I keep the pen? 
Say goodnight to Bobby and Snooky for me. 
Bye-bye. 
What is wrong? 
Excuse me 
- Lyle? Molly Jensen. 
The woman you were doing business with. 
What did she want? 
Did it have anything to do with me or Sam? 
- Sam? No. 
- That was Oda Mae Brown, right? 
Her name was Rita Miller. 
She was closing an account. 
Is there a problem? 
No. 
I guess not. 
Carl? 
ls something wrong? 
Did somebody play with the computers? 
- One of my accounts is closed. 
- What ´ s wrong? 
- Do you want me to call someone? 
Four million dollars! 
What am I going to do with this money? 
I ´ m going to buy the building. 
No, I ´ ll buy the block. 
I ´ m going to make my sister go to a fat farm. 
Wait, Oda Mae. 
Take the cheque out of your purse. 
You ´ re right, I ´ ll put it where nobody can get it. 
No. 
Endorse it. 
No, if I drop it, then somebody will get it. 
It ´ s not yours. 
I never said you would get the money. 
This is blood money. 
I was killed for this money. 
Endorse the cheque. 
- What are you going to do with it? 
- Look over there. 
To your left. 
You don ´ t think I ´ m giving this to a bunch of nuns? 
Otherwise they will track you down. 
Your only protection is to get rid of it. 
You ´ re kidding me! 
You ´ ll go to heaven! 
I want to go to a bank and cash this cheque. 
- Hello. 
- You ´ ll thank me later. 
- Endorse it" Rita Miller." 
- I know! 
Make it out to St Joseph ´ s Shelter. 
I don ´ t believe you ´ re making me do this! 
- Give it to her. 
- I just want to feel it in my fingers. 
- Just give her the cheque! 
- I will! 
- Give her the cheque! 
- I will! 
Bless you, child. 
Bless you. 
Give it to her. 
Let go. 
Let go! 
- I ´ m proud of you. 
- I don ´ t care. 
Stay away from me! 
What ´ ll that nun do with it? 
She can ´ t go buy underwear! 
Leave me alone! 
Never talk to me again. 
You ´ re wonderful, Oda Mae! 
Go ahead, search! 
You ´ ll never find it. 
They ´ re going to kill you and Willie. 
You ´ re going to be fertiliser. 
They ´ re going to bury you next to Jimmy Hoffa. 
Who ´ s doing that? 
Who ´ s doing that? 
Where were you? 
I thought we were having dinner. 
- Things got a little crazy, I forgot. 
- A little trouble at the bank. 
I wish you ´ d have called. 
I ´ ve been worried. 
- I ´ ve got to ask you about something. 
- He needs to borrow $ 4,000,000. 
When you said you thought Sam was talking to you, 
- what did he say to you? 
- Why? 
Listen, I want to know exactly what this psychic lady told you. 
Carl, let me go! 
Stop this! 
It doesn ´ t matter. 
What the hell ´ s happened to you? 
Does this have anything to do with her being at the bank today? 
At the bank? 
Ferguson said she closed an account. 
Her name isn ´ t even Oda Mae Brown. It ´ s Rita Miller. 
Carl. Are you all right? 
It ´ s just my stomach. 
Do you have some Pepto-Bismol? 
- Cyanide. 
- It ´ s upstairs. 
Sit down, I ´ ll get it. 
What ´ s wrong? 
Does little Carl have a tummy ache? 
Now do you believe in ghosts? 
I ´ ll set the place on fire! 
- I ´ ll cut her throat. 
- Carl! 
I swear to God. 
I ´ ll cut her throat. 
I need that money. 
I want it tonight, at 11 o ´ clock. 
If that psychic lady does not bring it here, Molly is dead, OK? 
Carl, who are you talking to? 
Nothing. 
Molly, I have to go. 
I can ´ t explain it now, but there ´ s a problem at the bank. 
- You ´ re scaring me. 
- I can ´ t talk now, I ´ ll be back. 
- Why not now? 
- I can ´ t talk now. 
I ´ ll come back at 11 o ´ clock, OK? 
I ´ m sorry, but it ´ s really important. 
- Eleven! 
- Oda Mae! 
I ´ m Arsenio Hall. 
Don ´ t try to adjust your television. 
I ´ m black. 
- I want to watch" Love Connection." 
- I love" Love Connection." 
Leave that! 
That ´ s Arsenio. 
You love" Love Connection," send your picture in. 
- She did! 
- They just haven ´ t answered yet. 
- Oda Mae! 
- Sam? 
We ´ re in trouble. 
They want the cheque. 
The cheque you said they would never know about? 
- What ´ s happening? 
- They ´ re here! 
Get out of here, now! 
Go, go! 
Knock on the doors! 
Help! 
- Let us in! 
- Who are you kidding? 
What are you doing? 
The cat don ´ t like visitors. 
They ´ re going to get us. 
Where ´ s Sam? 
- It looks like the bitch just left. 
- I ´ ll check downstairs. 
Carl? 
Willie! 
You ´ ve got a serious problem, man. 
Help me! 
Help! 
That dude is dead. 
You ´ re dead, Willie. 
Help me! 
Tell the driver to hurry. 
- Can you step on it, please. 
- I ´ m driving as fast as I can. 
Problems? 
- Carl, is that you? 
- It ´ s me, Oda Mae. 
I know what you think of me, but we ´ ve got to talk. 
You are in serious danger. 
- I ´ ve got Sam here with me. 
- Get the hell out of here! 
- Im calling the police! 
- Good. 
Tell her to do it! 
Fine. We want you to call the police. 
But you ´ ve got to let us in. 
Don ´ t you get it? 
Sam wasn ´ t accidentally killed, he was murdered. 
He found out that Carl was laundering money. 
Carl is dangerous. 
He tried to kill me. 
He ´ s going to try to kill you, too. 
You are in deep, deep trouble. 
Why are you doing this to me? 
Do you hear me? 
Why are you doing this to me? 
Oda Mae. Tell her she ´ s wearing the shirt that I spilt the margarita on, and the earrings I gave her for Christmas. 
Sam says you ´ re wearing the shirt he spilt the margarita on, and the earrings he gave you for Christmas. 
Don ´ t you see? 
I ´ m not a fake! 
Not about this. 
- Give me a penny. 
- What? 
- Push a penny under the door, now! 
- What are you talking about? 
- Tell her it ´ s for luck. 
- Sam says it ´ s for luck. 
Between Green and Mercer on Prince. 
It ´ s the grey building across from the post office. 
Thanks, Sergeant. 
Please hurry! 
We ´ ll be waiting. 
- They ´ re on their way. 
- Good. 
- What do we do now? 
- Just wait. 
Is Sam here? 
Sam? 
I ´ m sitting beside her. 
He ´ s sitting right beside you. 
Sam, can you feel me? 
With all my heart. 
He says with all his heart. 
I ´ d give anything if I could just touch you once more. 
He says he wishes he was alive again, so he could touch you. 
Me, too. 
OK. 
Look - you can use me. 
- Use you? 
- Use my body. 
- Use your body? 
- Quick, before I change my mind. 
- Molly, are you home? 
- Carl. 
- Molly! 
- Fire escape. 
What ´ s happening to me? 
Molly? 
Molly! 
Come on! 
Look! 
Let ´ s go! 
- Molly! 
- Get away from us, Carl! 
- Molly! 
- You ´ re just a liar. 
This woman ´ s a thief. 
She ´ s a con artist. 
Why are you doing this? 
Stop! 
Get away from us. 
I ´ ve called the police. 
Shit! 
- Carl, why are you doing this? 
- She ´ s a thief! 
Just give me the cheque! 
Get off me! 
Where is it? 
- Where is it, goddammit? 
- I gave it away. 
You ´ re lying to me. 
Don ´ t lie to me, goddammit. 
The cheque! 
I ´ ll kill her, Sam. 
I swear to God, I ´ ll kill her! 
Just give me the cheque, Sam. 
I promise you I ´ ll let her go if you just give it to me. 
Sam? 
Oh, Carl... 
What? 
Are you two all right? 
Sam? 
Molly? 
I can hear you! 
Oh, God! 
Sam? 
They ´ re waiting for you. 
I ´ ll miss you. 
Your mother ´ d be proud. 
I ´ m going to miss you too, Sam. 
You ´ re all right! 
Bye, Oda Mae. 
Bye, Sam. 
I love you, Molly. 
I ´ ve always loved you. 
Ditto. 
It ´ s amazing, Molly. 
The love inside - you take it with you. 
See you. 
See you. 
Miss Bird said brightly. 
Does that make you feel funny, son? 
You don't feel woozy? Like you might faint? 
- No, sir. - Good. 
I know it's writin', Thad. 
This all started just about the same time you started with your stories. 
- Sittin' in the dark, squinting' to see. - Hm. 
Couldn't that be it, Doctor? 
Couldn't all this come from straining' his eyes? 
Possibly. 
But these sounds, these bird sounds he's hearing. 
Sometimes a smell or a sound can be a sign of something more than eyestrain. 
I don't think we have an emergency, but we'll have to watch it, Thad. 
- Wanna be a writer, do ya? 
- Yes, sir. 
If he's so determined, you oughta buy the man a typewriter. 
We have our eye on a used one. 
Been saving' up for it. 
Maybe we ought to go ahead and buy it, huh, Thad? 
Seven-thirty, Thad. You'll miss your bus. 
Let's go, hotshot. 
Thaddeus. 
My Lord. 
All this in one mornin'? 
Thaddeus! 
Polly! There's something wrong with Thad Beaumont. 
Stay in your seats. Stay in your seats. 
Thad? What's wrong, honey? 
Three-by-five-centimetre window in the upper-left anterior portion of the skull. 
- BP is steady at 120 over 80. 
- I'm opening. 
- Oh, my. 
- Slight fluctuation. 
Hilary! 
Remember where you are, please. 
Respiration normal at 65. 
- Get someone in here. 
- What in the world is it? 
It's nothing. 
Once it was a twin. 
- Now it's nothing. 
- A twin? 
Unborn, but absorbed into the system. 
We'll continue with 18 units of valium, packed cells. 
We have an eye part of a nostril two teeth. 
Hm. 
One of the teeth has a small cavity. 
A year ago this was probably submicroscopic in size. 
Somehow it... got itself going again. 
The damn thing actually started to grow. 
- Incredible. 
- Don't ask me why. 
All I know is that we've located a very rare sort of... tumour. 
Close call, folks, but I think we got here just in time. 
I'm getting a slight elevation in blood pressure. 
What the hell...? 
Beautiful in Atlanta, no delays. 
Dallas, Fort Worth, experiencing thunderstorms. 
Watch out for serious weather in this area. 
Could be some tornado activity. 
Strong thunderstorms back through the central Rockies as well. 
Honey, can I... 
Can Mommy have that? 
Thank you very much. 
William. 
Don't... don't do that, buddy. 
- Oh, I'm sorry. 
- A born editor. 
It's not that bad, is it? 
Guess it is. Just a sec. 
I got something for you. 
I act like a pure klutz. 
There. Play with these things. 
- What do you think, Mommy? 
- Sh. Just a minute. 
I'm on the last page. 
- Not much? 
- Not much? 
- It's wonderful. 
- There's not a lot there. 
I stay up all night and produce nine lousy pages. 
- Nine perfect pages. It's great. 
- But is it a best seller? 
Who cares? 
It's gonna be a great book, Thad. 
You're doing it. 
You are actually really doing it. 
Oh... 
It's not comin' outta me easy. 
We are human beings. 
Plural. 
Each one of us is two separate beings. 
There's the outer being, the one we show to the world at large. 
Inhibited, timid... 
Often a pathological liar. 
And then there's the inner being. 
The truthful one. 
Passionate, uninhibited, even lustful. 
And most of us keep that inner being hidden away, locked up. 
But the fiction writer doesn't have to hide it, doesn't have to keep it from anything. 
He can let it out, bring it out in the open, let it live. 
Hell, he can give it the car keys, let it ride! 
Yes! 
In fact, he has to do that. 
It's essential. 
The writer has to let that inner being out of the lockup. 
He has to let it have a voice in his work otherwise the work itself will be inhibited. 
Timid. 
Without passion. 
It'll be a pack of lies. 
I think we'll cut it short today. 
I was up all night working. 
That inner being kept me awake. I... 
Your stories are due on Wednesday. Don't forget. 
Uh, w... would you autograph your book for me? 
Just make it out to Fred. 
Fred Clawson. 
- That's not my book. 
- Isn't it? 
No. 
Look here. 
Hm? 
The picture's a phoney. 
The name too." George Stark." 
Phoney. 
I know all about it. 
It's my turn to be storyteller, OK? 
There's this writer, see? 
Let's call him" Beaumont". 
He writes a coupla highbrow books about yuppies and faggots. 
The critics rave but nobody buys, so he changes his style. 
He starts writing about tits and tough guys. 
- He dreams up this badass character. 
- Machine. 
- Yeah. 
- Alexis Machine. 
He calls himself George Stark, so his mother won't find out he writes this shit. 
He slaps a phoney picture on the back, boom! 
He sells a million copies. 
So he writes three more of these things. 
Boom, boom, boom. 
He gets rich. 
- Not that rich. 
- Rich enough, I think. 
Rich enough. 
So, what's he gonna write next? 
A nice big cheque, if he wants me to keep my mouth shut about this. 
And if he doesn't want? 
- What if he doesn't care what you do? 
- Oh, he wants. 
He cares. 
And if he doesn't, the people around him do. 
They got a major-league scam goin' here. 
There's a million Americans out there just waiting to lay out their 29 and change for George to give' em another hard-on. 
They believe in George Stark. 
They believe he's writin' about shit he knows. 
They find out they've been lied to, that 29 and change might go back in the pocket. 
And I don't think you or the people around you wanna take that chance. 
- How'd you find out? 
- This babe who works for your publisher. 
I live in New York. 
She gave me the whole story. 
It's like Machine says in your book. 
" At nine o'clock, she came. 
At ten o'clock, she came across." 
I've written about slime before, Clawson, but none of it as low to the ground as you. 
- Maybe you'll put me in a book someday. 
- Oh, I will. 
And I'll make you suffer. 
Before you die. 
Uh, look, I got a bus to catch back to New York. 
You think about it. 
-" To Fred"? 
- Huh? 
Oh, yeah. 
Look, you talk to your people, see what it's worth to keep this outta the papers. 
I'll call you in a few days, and we can negotiate the, uh, payment plan. 
Oh, and thanks for the autograph. 
Don't go crazy over this. 
We'll figure out a way to handle it. 
Oh, it's just such an invasion. 
Who needs this shit? 
Oh... 
OK, come on. You're gonna help me. 
They're both up. 
Who's the best boy? 
Who's the best boy? 
Who's all wet? Whoo-oo. 
OK. OK. 
There you go. 
OK, just a minute, swirly-whirly. 
I know how you could blow this guy off, really knock him for a loop. 
I'd like to knock him for a loop. 
Little stinker. That dirty little stinker. That little rat. 
I oughta go get him. 
That's what Alexis Machine would do. 
He'd cut off his pecker and shove it in his little rat mouth so when they found him, they'd know he was a squealer. 
- How can I knock him for a loop? 
- Go to the press yourself. 
Tell them" I'm George Stark." 
OK, come on. 
If I do this crazy thing your mother's talkin' about we'll end up livin' on cat food. 
I think Thad Beaumont can sell enough books to keep his family off the streets. 
What do you guys think, huh? 
Is it time to say" Bye-bye, Uncle George?" 
Yeah. Hm. 
Well, I guess it's unanimous. 
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. 
Oh, no. 
- Shit! 
- That's all right. 
- I think I cooked it a little too long. 
- No, it'II... it'll be good. 
So that's the story, Rick. 
It seems like going public is the right thing to do. 
I just need to know you're all right with it. 
Stark earns a lot more for you than I do. 
Well, hey, if you don't want me to do this, I'll give it some more thought. 
Yeah. 
Yeah... 
No, absolutely. 
Oh, yeah, sure we have. 
- Miriam? 
What, is she there? 
- Are you kidding? 
You guys patching things up? 
No such thing. 
We're committed to making our divorce work. 
But she still is my business partner. She's picking up the extension. 
Thad, your new book is gonna win awards and sell 200,000 hardback. 
Who needs George Stark? 
We'll help you get rid of him. 
I'll put out a press release, you can do the talk shows. 
I say hallelujah. 
You heard the lady, Thad. We're with you 1000 /, baby. 
Bye, Thad. 
Kiss the babies for me. 
- Bye-bye. 
- Talk to you soon. 
- Shit. 
- He shouldn't be writing trash. 
We have a lot of clients who can make us money with trash. 
I like trash. I love trash. 
I read George Stark cos it's fun. 
I read Thad Beaumont because it's my job. 
That's why we now live across town from each other. 
Let's get back to work. 
So we kill off George Stark. 
OK, that's OK. We kill off Stark. 
Hey, maybe Beaumont's books start to sell. 
Who knows? 
Stranger things have happened. Stranger things have happened. 
- You're not sold on this? 
- It's the money, Liz. 
We're used to a pretty nice life. 
Flushing that away just... 
Be honest, Thad. 
You don't wanna give up George. 
You've become attached to him. 
Yeah, well, I mean, is that so weird? 
I've been working with the guy for a long time. 
I'm used to him. 
I like having him around. 
Sure. 
He lets you do what you want, say anything you want, be anything you want. 
He's your drinking buddy. 
Liz, I'm not an alcoholic. Hm? 
- George Stark is. 
- Oh, come on. 
You don't realise what you're like when you write those books, do you? 
- It's like watching Jekyll turn into Hyde. 
- That's a little extreme. 
I'm not out raping barmaids. 
Thad Beaumont gave up drinking. He gave up smoking. 
George Stark didn't. 
And these god-awful moods you get in... 
You say these really mean things sometimes. 
Look, I am who I am, Liz. It's all me. 
It's all part of me. 
Even the ugliness is a part of me. 
" Machine turned the razor down and slashed the strop in two." 
" A long section fell to the floor like a severed tongue." 
"' Cut him' Jack Rainsley said eagerly. 
'Cut him while I stand and watch."' 
"' I wanna see the blood flow."' 
" Halstead squeezed his eyes shut, but the razor slid effortlessly through the lid and punctured the eyeball beneath with a faint popping sound." 
"' I'm back' Machine said. 
'I'm back from the dead and you don't seem glad to see me at all, you ungrateful son of a bitch."' 
I hope you're not looking for any social significance, Mr Donaldson because there ain't none to be found. 
You're the New Yorker. 
I can tell by the hair. 
Mike Donaldson, People Magazine. 
You're, uh... the photographer? 
Yes, sir. Homer Gamache. 
I'm gonna do this up brown for you. 
And you're Thad Beaumont. 
Seen you around town. 
Whoever'd have thought you was a celebrity? 
- I'm not the celebrity. 
George Stark is. 
- Well, we're here to change that. 
Come on, you guys. Let's go. 
Thad, will you grab my purse, please? 
- Yeah. 
- OK. All right. 
All right, I got the diaper bag. 
- You've got a terrific getaway. 
- Thank you. 
Oh, excuse me. 
We can never get up here. 
When Thad's teaching, we have to stay in the city. 
Trudy, thanks for coming over. 
- Did they take pictures of the little ones? 
- No. 
Good. 
Kidnappers around, you know. 
They might see a picture, it might give' em some ideas. 
They're not gonna take pictures of the kids. 
Not while I'm around they won't. 
These men make a mess, don't they? 
- Well... 
- Come on, let's go upstairs. 
I'm doin' a series of photographs. 
You... you might be interested in this. 
Photographs of teddy bears. 
Lyin' in coffins! 
I wanna make' em into a book. 
The final perfect comment on the American way of... death. 
All this folderol we put ourselves through. 
Hate funerals. 
Hate any kind of folderol. 
I'll show it to you when it's done. 
Who knows? 
Maybe you'd like to... write the text. 
Not much of a view. 
If I had a window in here I think I'd just sit and stare at the lake all day. 
This is where George Stark came into being. 
Right here in this room. 
- I noticed the old typewriter. 
- Yeah, I've had that since I was a boy. 
- I still use it. 
George doesn't. 
- You're kidding. 
No. George doesn't hold with typewriters. 
George uses one of these. 
From day one, he's used these. 
You really are serious? 
Dead serious. 
It's the truth. 
- Was it hard to get George started? 
- No. 
One evening I was just sitting here. 
I picked up one of these pencils. 
Before I knew it, I'd written 16 pages without a single scratch-out. 
It was like George just woke up and started to talk. 
You'II, uh... forgive me for noting but these behaviours could be interpreted as classic symptoms of schizophrenia. 
Yes, I'll forgive you for noting that. 
I don't think George would, though. 
I don't think George would like any of this, Mr Donaldson. 
This isn't George's idea of a fun morning. 
In fact, I think it's safe to say that George would want your balls for breakfast. 
- Thaddeus. 
Elizabeth. 
- Hi, Digger. 
I hope you don't mind crazy Homer. 
- He wants to set up a fake tombstone. 
- A fake tombstone? 
" You don't want to go walkin' on the dead" I says. 
" Make sure you use an empty plot where nobody's buried." 
Then I remembered" Thad Beaumont owns one" that your daddy bought for you over here near where your ma and pa is buried. 
So I said" Why don't you use that?" 
So, I hope you don't mind. 
This is where Homer is settin' up. 
GEORGE STARK 1985-1991 GEEN AARDIGE vent 
This was my idea. 
I was takin' pictures of teddy bears when I thought of it. 
Ain't it a hoot? 
I told you I was gonna do this up brown for ya. 
Must be strange for you, Thad. 
Kinda like standing over your own grave. 
You know, I just... 
I really think that this is, you know, a little much. 
- Yeah. 
- Aw, it's good fun, is all. 
- New York's gonna love it. 
Wait and see. 
- The American way of death. 
That's it! 
A little folderol for old George there. 
- Come on in now. 
We're losin' the light. 
- Why not just take a couple of Thad? 
All right. OK. 
Come in near the stone. 
I'll just be a minute now. 
Damned if it don't look real. 
- What are these? 
- That's it. 
That's it. 
Now, how about you two, uh... 
- What? Oh. 
All right, all right. 
- Oh, much better. 
- How about you two shakin' hands? 
- Shaking hands now? 
Yeah, shakin' hands over top of the stone. 
Come on! It's all in fun. 
That's it. 
Now, smile. 
Act like you're enjoyin the hell out of this. 
- Oh, we are. 
- For all the world to see. 
- Are you sorry you did it? 
- I'm only sorry about two things. 
One, we look like a pair of idiots. 
What's number two? 
I just know we can't hide from publicity any more. 
We've had it pretty easy in that department. 
You'll be flavour of the month, they forget you, then you win the Pulitzer. 
- What else? Come on. 
- Nothin'. 
Honestly? 
Honestly. 
You gotta be kiddin', pal. 
At one in the damn a. m? 
Hey, that looks like... 
What the hell...? 
The American way of death, Homer. 
Without any folderol! 
Digger, calm down. 
I'll get somebody over right away. Right away. 
Digger Holt. 
- Seein' ghosts again? 
- Yep. 
- Hm. - Where's Norris? 
Out on a call. 
You want me to track him down? 
No. I'll go myself. 
- I'll be over at Homeland. 
- All right. 
I'll be here. 
Castle Rock Police. 
H... here we are, Sheriff. 
Don't it look like what I said? 
Don't it look like somebody dug his way out of there? 
Like somebody was buried alive and dug his way out? 
Someone dug a hole in your graveyard. 
That's all it is, nothin' more. 
But somebody was in there, Sheriff. 
Look here. 
He set his hands in the dirt here to boost hisself out. 
So whoever dug the hole got down in it to do the digging'. 
You got yourself a clear case of vandalism. 
That's the way I see it. 
This is where they set up for that picture in the magazine. 
- Yeah. Picture of the Beaumonts. 
I saw it. 
- Well, this here's the Beaumont plot. 
And this hole is a-sittin' right smack where they set up that fake tombstone. 
It's just a hole in the ground. 
Forget it, Digger. 
Fill the damn thing in and forget it. 
- Pangborn here. 
- Yeah, Sheriff, it's Marty. 
Me and Norris just found old Homer Gamache, deader than a squashed coon. 
- Jesus! 
- Guy across the street saw Homer stop last night to pick up a hitchhiker about, uh, 1am. 
White male. 
We figure he popped him for his truck. 
We got a description out on it. 
He took his leg. 
He took his damn leg. 
No, he didn't take it. 
It's over there. 
That's what he beat him with. 
Beat him with his own wooden leg. 
He was just an old man, you son of a bitch. 
Why didn't you just clip him one, take his truck and leave him be? 
Why this? 
I hope I get a chance to ask you. 
I want everybody in the world lookin for that truck. 
I wanna get this fucker. 
Ask Mama if she believes this. 
He drove it like this? 
All the way from Maine, he drove it like this? 
Ask Mama if she believes this. 
- So, how was it? 
How was New York? 
- Noisy. 
God, I'm so sick of the same old questions, over and over again. 
" Tell us about the pencils."" Why'd you give him a prison record?" 
" Why do you suppose Machine is so popular?" 
- Thanks a lot, Donna. 
- You're welcome. 
They were great. 
Listen, I know they're a handful. 
Say hi to your mom for me. 
- Are you Elizabeth Beaumont? 
- Yes. 
- Alan? - Is your husband home, Mrs Beaumont? 
Well, yes, he is. 
Alan, is there some kind of problem? 
It's all right. 
I know these folks. 
We have to talk to Thad, Liz. 
Well, sure. 
Come on in. 
I'll call him. 
Alan. What are you doin' in Ludlow? 
Are you Thaddeus Beaumont? 
Yeah. 
What's goin' on, Alan? 
We're here to question you in connection with a capital crime. 
- You have the right to remain silent... 
- Jesus, what is this? 
You have to right to legal counsel. 
If you cannot afford legal counsel such will be provided for you. 
I don't know why you're 160 miles out of your territory lookin' at me like I was birdshit on a new car, but I'll tell you this : 
I won't answer any questions until you tell me what's goin' on. 
It's about Homer Gamache. 
- Oh, the photographer. 
What about him? 
- He's been murdered. 
- Jesus. 
By who? 
- Evidence says you did it. 
- This is a... 
Alan! This is a joke. 
- Can you account for your whereabouts during the time period from 11 p.m. last Friday until 1am Saturday morning? 
Yes. 
I was in New York. 
I just got back today a little while ago. 
- How long were you there? 
- I left Friday, four o'clock out of Bangor. 
Anyone meet you there? 
Did you do anything that night? 
No. 
I... 
Let's see. 
I called my agent, Rick Cowley, to let him know I was comin' in. 
You called him, but you didn't see him. 
- You think I'm lying to ya? 
- There is that possibility and I've got to consider it. 
From what I know about you, you're not the kind of person to do a thing like this. 
None of that counts when it comes to doin' my job. 
Look, call TWA, or the hotel, Sherry Netherland. 
They must have a record of when I checked in. 
We haven't been up to Castle Rock for weeks. 
Why are you so determined to lay this off on Thad? 
Because he thinks I did it. 
He thinks I did... 
Thad? Are you OK? 
Honey, are you all right? 
Are you OK? 
Yeah. 
Yeah, I'm all right. 
If this turns out to be a mistake I will personally find the man who screwed up this ID and pull his skin off. 
What ID? 
What's this evidence you have? I mean, why? 
Why me? 
First off, there's the connection between you and Homer. 
- The pictures. 
- One was taken in Homeland Cemetery. 
- Yeah. 
- Someone went there Friday night and dug a hole in your family plot. 
A hole big enough to bury a man. 
Homer was murdered less than a mile away. 
Look, Thad, this can't be. 
Somebody is doing this to... 
It's that creep. It's Clawson. 
- Who? 
- There's this guy, Fred Clawson. 
Lives in New York. 
I don't know where. 
He found out I wrote the George Stark books. 
He was threatening to blackmail me. 
That's why I went public. 
We'll ask NYPD to check him out. 
What else you got, Alan? 
I don't believe you'd track me all the way here just because of a hole in the ground. 
The killer took Homer's pickup truck. 
A Connecticut trooper found it in a used-car lot just north of the state line. 
They found fingerprints in the truck, some of' em stamped in Homer's blood. 
They fed' em into a graphics computer and your service record came back. 
Your prints match up. 
Exactly. 
You know, someone said that the world's a stage, and each of us must play a part. 
Fate had me playing in love, with you as my sweetheart. 
Act One was when we met. 
I loved you at first glance. 
You read your lines so tenderly. 
Then came Act Two. 
Using the change, you acted strange and why, I'll never know. 
Miss Bird said... brightly... 
Down here, we call that fool's stuffing. 
What do you mean," down here"? 
Endsville, Thad. 
The place where all rail service terminates. 
You always were the clumsy one, old Hoss. 
Then they can bring the curtain down. 
I'm not done with you, cock-knocker. 
Remember that. 
You don't wanna fuck with me. 
Cos when you fuck with me you're fuckin' with the best. 
Clawson. 
There's police here to see you. 
Clawson? 
You owe me two weeks' rent. 
If these guys are here to take you away, I want it now! 
Let's check it out. 
He's back. 
- He's back. 
- Who's back? 
Alan Pangborn. 
I wondered if we could all just sit down and have a cold one. 
No. 
Yeah. 
I'll have one. 
I have no business being' here socialisin' with a man who is now a suspect in not just one murder but two. 
- Two? 
- Yeah. 
Your buddy. 
Frederick Clawson. 
- God! 
- When? 
Night before last. 
In New York, while you were still there. 
Night, uh... night before last. 
Night before last, I was at... 
You were at a press reception till about 11 o'clock. 
We think Clawson was killed around nine or ten but it could have been as late as midnight. 
We got another set of fingerprints out of Clawson's apartment. 
Once again, they match yours exactly. 
Christ! 
What is going on, Thad? 
Well, I'm surprised you brought beer, not handcuffs. 
- What's keepin' me outta jail? 
- Me, I guess. 
New York guys think you should be brought in. 
- Why are you lettin' me off the hook? 
- I'm not. 
You're still very much on the hook, Thad. 
And if you killed these people, I'm gonna pull you in the boat. 
I figure you're not goin' anywhere. 
Hard for a man like you to hide. 
I'm willin' to let you sleep at home while I work on this some more. 
Meanwhile you build a case to beat my alibis. 
I'm not tryin' to beat your alibis any more than I'm tryin' to prove' em. 
I was so sure it was Clawson. 
Well, suppose he killed himself. 
- He could make that look like Thad did it. 
- The way he died, that's impossible. 
Did anybody else know that you and Clawson were connected? 
Clawson got his information from someone who works for my publisher. 
That's all he told me. 
I don't have a name. You mentioned the way he was killed. 
Yeah. 
It looked like a, uh, classic gangland hit. 
- Shot? - No, no. 
You don't shoot a blabbermouth. 
You make him bleed. 
Make him suffer. 
Clawson's tongue was cut out. 
He was castrated and his penis stuffed into his mouth. 
That's exactly what I said I wanted to do to him. 
I was joking. 
I said if I was Alexis Machine, that's exactly what I would do. 
That's a character in one of his books. 
Alexis Machine. 
It was a joke. 
Come on, Alan. Would I admit that to you if I killed the guy? 
There was somethin written on the wall at Clawson's. 
Written in the victim's blood. 
" The sparrows are flying again." 
Does that mean anything to either of you? 
- No. 
- Thad? 
No. 
You're sure? 
Doesn't mean a th... thing. 
You're keepin' secrets, Thad. 
That's no good. It never was. 
Some psychotic out there has killed two people that we know and has somehow made it look like you did it. 
This guy's obviously out to get you. 
I mean, have you considered that you might be in danger? 
That all of us might be next on this guy's hit list? 
Now, come on, Thad. 
This is not a good time to be holdin' things back. 
No, it's not a good time. 
The sparrows are flying again. 
It means something to you. 
What is it? 
Oh, Thad. What is goin' on? 
There's more. 
I wrote those words and I don't remember doing it. 
I was in some kind of... trance. 
The tumour I had when I was a boy. 
I told you about the headaches it caused. 
- Did I ever tell you about the sounds? 
- Sounds? 
No. 
People with brain tumours sometimes have symptoms, sensory precursors. 
They smell things, hear things, that aren't actually there. 
I used to hear birds. 
I've started hearing them again. 
Thad, you have to go and see the doctor. 
Maybe you have another tumour. 
That would explain the sounds. But what about the rest of it? 
Liz, I blanked out for an entire period of time. 
I wrote those words, and I have no recollection of doing it. 
I mean, what if there are other things I've done? 
What if there are other things I've done... 
that I can't remember? 
Thad! I'm delighted to see that they haven't incarcerated you. 
Sounds like the police have been in touch. 
They wanted me to confirm that you were a man of good character. 
I lied, and told them that you were. 
- Are you in trouble, Thad? 
- I'm in somethin'. 
Just a mix-up, I think, but it's got me goin'. 
Any way I can help? 
There's some weird shit goin' on. 
I could use some help from an old witch doctor. 
- Come, let's talk. 
- I can't, Reggie. 
I'm... scrambled. I... 
- Call if you need me. 
- I will. 
Thanks. 
Endsville for ever. 
Oh! Oh! Oh! 
No! No! 
No! 
No! 
No! 
Shut up, or I'll have to cut you, sis. 
- What do you want? 
- What'd I just say? 
Now, you're gonna make us a little telephone call, sissy. 
No. 
I know what you're thinking. 
You're thinking you could brain me with that thing. 
Not a very happy thought. 
You know what happens to people who lose their happy thoughts? Hm? 
No! 
They fall out of the sky. 
Now... 
We're gonna call us Thad Beaumont. 
- W... what do I say? 
- Oh, you'll think of something. 
Hi. 
We can't come to the phone right now but if you leave your name and number at the beep we'll get back to you as soon as we can. 
Tell him who you are and what's happenin' here. 
Do it. 
Don't make me tell you twice. 
Do it, or I'll cut your fuckin' head off with this thing. 
Thad! 
Thad, there's... there's a... 
- Say your name. 
... man here, there's a bad man here. 
- Say your name. 
- Miriam. 
Please help me! 
There's a man here. 
Please don't let him cut me any more! 
Pangborns... 
Sure. 
Hey, Dad! 
Phone! 
Turn it down a little, son. 
- Yeah. 
- It's Thad Beaumont. 
- A lady in New York needs help fast. 
- Go ahead. 
Shoot. 
Miriam Cowley. 
My agent's ex-wife. 
She called here. 
I wasn't home. 
I got a recording on my machine. 
And I heard a man's voice. 
She said he was threatening to hurt her, uh, to cut her. 
She begged me not to let him do that again. 
I tried to call her back, but couldn't get through. 
- What's the address? 
- 109 West 84th. 
I was gonna call the New York police. 
No, you did the right thing. 
I'll call' em. 
I can cut through the shit. 
Give me a break here, son. 
- Problem? 
- Yep. 
- Bad? 
- Well, we can hope. 
This is Alan Pangborn... 
Yeah? 
Yeah, hello? 
Oh, God. 
Miriam's dead. 
Alan, I think there might be some other people that are in danger. 
Rick Cowley. 
I'm sure he's gonna go after Rick. 
Now, he lives at 129 East 68th. 
And, uh, the guy that wrote that article. 
He'll probably go after him. 
Mike Donaldson. 
He lives in New York too, but I'm not sure where. 
What do you know that you're not tellin' me? 
I think I know who's doing these things. 
- Give him to me. 
- Not over the phone. 
- Can you get here tomorrow? 
- I need to know tonight. 
Can't we do it tomorrow, face to face? 
Look, I've been tryin' to cut you every break I can. 
Don't stretch my limit. 
I can give you a description. 
I'm not entirely sure it's right but I think it's close. 
He's about my size, blue eyes, same as mine. 
Hair slicked back. 
About my age. 
In better shape, though. 
Strong, muscular. 
He lives in Oxford, Mississippi, and he's got a little bit of a cracker accent. 
He might be driving an old black Toronado. 
It's got letters on the back. 
" High Toned Son Of A Bitch". 
You can tell me all this, but not who the guy is? 
Knowing his name tonight isn't gonna help. 
He's probably using the name of George Stark. 
Shit! 
Goddamn city. 
Oh, no. 
Hello, Mike. 
Goodbye, Mike. 
Somebody help! 
- What's going on? 
- Murder. 
D'you want some? 
Whoops! 
Well, I guess I'd better punt. 
- What the hell is that down there? 
- I don't know. 
Got your flashlight? 
- Oh, look at this. 
Jesus fucking Christ. 
- You think this is the guy? 
- Is this the fuckin' guy... 
- How the fuck do I know, huh? 
- Christ! 
- Oh, this is really some shit, man. 
- Hey. Hey! 
- Forget about it. 
- Who the hell is that? 
- I don't know. 
He's gone. 
Oh, look at this shit. 
- Hello. 
- Good mornin', Rick. 
This is the man who cut your woman's throat. 
What? 
- Who are you? 
- Ask Thad Beaumont who I am. 
He knows all about it. 
Tell him I said you were walkin' around dead and tell him I'm not done makin' fool's stuffing yet. 
Wait a minute. 
Wait a minute. Who are you? 
Oh, God! God! 
Have a good one, man. 
Jesus Christ! 
You asshole! 
Fuck you! 
So tell me, Thad. 
Who do you think is doin' this? 
- Give me a name. 
- I gave you a name. 
The name is George Stark. 
- I don't think I understand you. 
- What my husband is trying to say is that he thinks George Stark has somehow come to life. 
Now, look, Alan, I don't expect you to be the type of guy to believe this, but, um you're all we've got right now. 
Thad has some things he's gonna tell you. 
You don't have to believe him, but you have to trust that he believes. 
Because if you don't, this man, or whatever he is, is gonna go on killing and he's gonna keep on killing till he gets to me and Thad and the babies. 
You don't believe it, do you? 
Not a single word of it. 
If you'd told me these people were murdered by a ghost I wouldn't believe ya. 
But I can come closer to believing' a ghost story than this. 
You're not just talkin' about a ghost, you're talkin' about a man who never was. 
Maybe you'd like to tell me where this guy came from. 
Did you just give birth to him one night? 
Did he pop out of a damn sparrow's egg? 
Exactly how did it go? 
I don't know when he became a separate person. 
It was when we tried to kill him. 
Look, I'm willing to consider all sorts of crazy possibilities here. 
But when you tell me this guy is George Stark... 
He might think he's George Stark, I'll give you that. 
But he's not. 
He can't be. 
He's a crazy man, Thad. 
A goddamn homicidal lunatic crazy man is what he is. 
And I'm gonna catch him. 
Hold it, Mr Cowley. 
The guys from communications are supposed to be here. 
- Maybe they're inside. 
- One should be right out here. 
It's standard procedure. 
Come on. 
- Maybe they never showed up. 
- Let's try' em on the radio. 
- Where they comin' from? 
Downtown? 
- I don't know. 
Call the precinct. 
Look, I gotta get some sleep. I'm dead. 
- We'll be here. 
- Maybe we'll send out for Chinese later. 
- My treat. 
- Thanks. 
Jesus Christ! 
I've decided to change agents. 
I'm sorry, Rick. 
It's a cutthroat business. 
God! 
Oh, Jesus. 
Rick... 
Rick is gone. 
I don't believe this. 
I can't believe this. 
I mean, so much for your fucking police protection! 
Oh, bullshit! 
Bullshit! 
They didn't! 
No, they didn't! 
I don't care what you think. 
You wanna think about something? 
Think about what I told you. 
Think about George Stark. 
Think about that! 
What does he want? 
He wants the same thing you and I would want if we were in the same position. 
He doesn't wanna be dead any more! 
Jesus. 
Rick... 
Miriam. 
Who's next? 
I, uh... 
I think that's everything, Mr Beaumont. 
We'll call from the outside to make sure the system's working. 
OK, fine. 
Thank you. 
We don't have to make a test call. 
Pull your meter. 
I'll check it out in the cellar. 
Somebody gonna answer it? 
Mr Beaumont? 
- Something the matter? 
- It's him. 
It's who? 
What do you want, you son of a bitch? 
Cool down, Thad. 
No need to get your panties all in a bunch. 
- What do you want? 
- To tell you it's over. 
I got the last one this noontime. 
Little girl who used to work for your publisher. 
The cops'll find her. 
Some of her is on the floor. The rest is on the table. 
Jesus Christ! 
I'm gonna head down south and do me some fishin'. 
- This city life's tiring' me out. 
- He's lying. 
- You lying fuck. 
- Why, Thad, that's not very nice. 
Did you think I was gonna hurt you? 
Hell, no. 
I was gettin' revenge for you, boy. 
You knew all along I was the one that had to do it. 
- You got a chicken liver. - He's lying. 
He knows you're listening. 
I'm not gonna bother you any more, Thad. 
I know you're gonna come after us, George. 
I know you're gonna come after me. 
And I think I know what you want. 
Well, you just come ahead. 
I'll know you're comin'. 
- I'll know because I'll hear the birds. 
- Birds? 
That's right. 
I'll hear the birds, and I'll be waitin'. 
Waitin' to fuckin' take you apart. 
- Dear God! 
- You're talkin' crazy, Thad. 
What birds? 
Sparrows. 
Don't you hear the sparrows? 
Well, whatever you're talkin' about doesn't matter, because... this is over. 
- Clear as a bell. 
- Let's check the van. 
The call was made from a payphone in Times Square. 
They're checkin' to see if the voice might have been a tape recording. 
What, made by me? 
Your calling-card number was used to pay for the call. 
Jesus. After all this, I'm still a suspect. 
Look, I know they can't hang last night's work on you. 
You were here. 
- But they think you have an accomplice. 
- That is the craziest thing I ever heard! 
I wish I could say the same thing, Thad. 
You gave me a description, remember? 
The witness at Donaldson's says the killer matches that description perfectly. 
You told me he was driving a black Toronado. 
The place where they found Homer's pick-up says it was stolen off their lot. 
That and the fingerprints. And you named the victims before they were killed. 
I mean, Jesus Christ, man. What do you expect people to think? 
- What do you think, Alan? 
- I think some psycho's got it in for you. 
Somebody clever enough to go diggin' around to find out things he could use to make you look guilty. 
It's either that or it's you, Thad. 
It could be that somehow you are behind all this. 
Don't think I've written that possibility off. 
Well, you'd better write it off. 
Stop looking at me and start lookin' over your shoulder. 
It could be real unhealthy for you if you don't. 
- How ya doin', Mr Beaumont? 
- Uh, I've been better, Rosalie. 
Been better. 
Hello? 
It's for you, Mr Beaumont. 
- Hello, George. - Thad. 
How's it hangin'? 
- What do you want? 
- You know the answer to that. 
You figured it out, and figured right. 
It's time to start a new book. 
Oh, I don't think so. 
I'm finished with you. 
George Stark is dead. 
I'm not dead, Hoss. 
Not hardly. 
I'm just gettin' started. 
You better do what I say or I'll be comin' for ya. 
You will die like no other man on earth has ever died before. 
Start another book, boy. 
Go home and sharpen your pencils. 
- Any calls? 
- None that matter. 
I'll be over home. 
Hm. Guess I'll have to call you back, Sheriff. 
Oh, God. 
Oh, Jesus, Annie. 
I'm sorry. 
- Darlin', I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. - It's OK. 
God. I didn't realise how jumpy I've been gettin'. 
This Beaumont business. 
What's he like? 
Beaumont. 
How do you know? 
How do you ever know? 
I'm taking him to work. 
Maybe you should send another unit out to watch the house. 
Come on. 
Come on, get over here. 
That's good. 
Here. 
Look, if you can't... 
Look, this is your favourite toy. 
Would you... would you guys please... 
Just please be... 
Would you guys please shut up? 
I'll be a coupla hours. 
- You want some coffee? 
- I've got my thermos. 
Let me in, George. 
Come on, George. 
Let me come visit for a while. 
Let me see what the hell you're up to. 
Come on, George. 
Let me in. 
Oh, God. 
They're real. 
The sparrows are real. 
Why... do you want to write again? 
Why do you say that? 
Falling apart? 
Falling... apart. 
How? 
How must we fall? 
Tell me... why, George. 
What? 
Smarts, don't it, Thad? 
Hurts like a real son of a bitch. 
I sure hope you can take it, Hoss. 
Now... 
Take it like a man. 
Oh, yeah. 
Like a man. 
- Where are you going? 
- Bangor. 
- What's in Bangor? 
- I don't know. 
Maybe nothing. 
- It's where I had surgery as a boy. 
- Here. 
Take these. 
A disguise. 
A changed man. 
Car key. 
I hope you'll have the decency to stand good for any repairs if it gets wounded. 
- How will you get home? 
- A cab, I imagine. 
I'll get a receipt and present it to you at the proper moment. 
- Thanks, old friend. 
- Thank you for bringing adventure. 
Just for fun, see if you can find anything in your books about sparrows. 
Sparrows? 
Sparrows... 
There is something about sparrows. 
A twin? 
They never told you? 
No. No, they said it was a tumour. 
Well... in a way, that's all it was. 
Foreign matter that happened to wind up in your head. 
I don't see anything, Thad, but if you're hearing things again we'd better shoot some pictures. 
A great many of us start out as twins. 
At least one in ten, probably more. 
The stronger fetus absorbs the weaker and comes to birth as a single child. 
In your case, the fetus wasn't completely absorbed and it had to be removed surgically. 
Your mom and dad were pretty rattled by the whole thing. 
They insisted that the excised tissue be treated as human remains and signed over to them. 
- They wanted to bury it. 
- Bury it. 
In Homeland Cemetery, in the family plot. 
Don't know. 
- They ever tell you about the sparrows? 
- The sparrows? 
It was the damnedest thing. 
We'd just finished your surgery when this enormous flock of sparrows, thousands of them came swarming down onto the hospital. 
They never figured out what the hell it was. 
Some kind of migration or something. 
Made a hell of a mess. 
Windows broke. 
Three or four people got hurt. 
You're... bleeding pretty good there. 
Let me put a proper dressing on that. 
- What did you say it was? A cut? 
- Oh, uh... 
No, I, uh... poked myself. 
It'll stick in my mind for ever. 
You complaining about those bird sounds, and us getting hit by those sparrows. 
It was like we took the sound out of your head and it... came to life. 
Howdy, Doc. 
Remember me? 
Jesus! 
You bastard. 
Jesus. 
- Hello? 
- You gotta get out of there right now. 
- Thad? What are you talk... 
- He's here. 
Stark is here in Bangor. 
That's 20 minutes away. 
Get the hell out of there now. 
- What are you doing in Bangor? 
- Liz, please! 
Just listen to me. 
Get out of there, all right? 
There's no time. 
He's killed Doc Pritchard. 
- He's gonna come after you and the kids. 
- All right. All right, we'll go. 
- No, promise me. 
Promise me. 
- I promise you we'll go. 
We'll go now. 
Don't pack anything. 
Just get the hell out. 
Wait. How do I get in touch with you? 
Through the school. Just, um... 
Uh, Reggie. 
Don't tell her where you're going or where you are. 
Tell her you're safe. 
Don't tell anyone who might tell me where you are. 
I can't know. 
Do you understand me? 
- I cannot know where you are. 
- All right, we'll go. 
I love you, Liz. 
I love you. I love you more than anything. 
I love you. 
OK, listen. 
Mommy's gonna take you on a little ride... 
Shit. 
I got a despatch. Code six. 
Uh, there's been, uh... 
You better call an ambulance. 
There's... 
- Ambulance? 
- Call an ambulance. 
For God's sakes, we're in danger here, Alan. 
My babies are in danger. 
I can't let you just go runnin' off. 
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't let you. 
- But Stark could be out there. 
- There is no George Stark, Elizabeth. 
- He doesn't exist. 
- Somebody exists. 
Thad said he saw him. 
I don't give a damn what Thad said. 
Your husband ought to be in the county jail and I'm startin' to feel like a damn idiot for not puttin' him there a long time ago. 
You're just gonna have to sit tight and ride this out. 
Nothing is going to happen. 
You're under police protection. 
- Am I under protection, or under arrest? 
- You call it what you like. 
I'm sorry, Liz. 
I've been way too soft on this thing. 
I've gotta start goin' by the book. 
Now let me talk to the officer there. 
He wants to talk to you. 
- Yes, sir? 
- Just hold the fort there, son. 
I'll have two units out to replace you before nightfall. 
Keep your eyes open. 
If Thad Beaumont shows up, you pull him in on suspicion... 
Murder one. 
Yes, sir. 
Got it covered, sir. 
I think the absorbed fetus was merely a vessel, a stolen body, if you like. 
It just happened to be there, wholly by accident, and Stark used it. 
He took it for his own. 
Stark is a conjuration an entity created by the force of your will. 
We all have something of the beast inside us. 
We can either suppress it or encourage it. 
In your case, you encouraged it too much. 
In your subconscious, you wanted it to live. 
You wanted it so badly, it actually came to be. 
Your characters have always been vividly written, Thad. 
I wanted him to live. 
God forgive me, it's true. 
A part of me has always admired George Stark. 
Admired his simple, violent nature. 
A man who doesn't stumble over things, who never looks weak or silly. 
A man with a straight, sharp answer for everything. 
Yes. But he's a bastard. 
Half of me is a bastard. 
My dark half. 
George Stark is my dark half. 
Yeah, but surely you don't want him to stay alive. 
I mean, you can't still admire him after all that he's done. 
- No. 
- If you don't want him, he can't remain. 
You're the one with life, real life. 
He's trying to take it away from you. 
But if you're not willing to give it up what can he do? 
Kill you? 
That would be suicide, wouldn't it? 
Why didn't I see that? 
He can't hurt me, so he's going after the people around me. 
Exactly. 
I found something in Barringer's here. 
Something about sparrows. 
Whippoorwills, loons and sparrows are psychopomps. 
- What? 
From the Greek. 
It means" those who conduct". 
In this case, those who conduct human souls back and forth between the land of the living and the land of the dead. 
Hello? 
Thad! It's for you. 
I'm not gonna write your book, George. 
You're dead. 
And dead you're gonna stay! 
You're wrong, old Hoss. 
You wanna get started. 
Start by nightfall or you'll be a sorry son of a bitch. You won't be the only one. 
See if you can figure out where I'm callin' from, Thad. 
No! 
- That was quick, Hoss. 
- What have you done to them? 
Not a thing... yet. 
Not to your people. 
I had to do a few things to that state trooper watching' your house. 
What's left of him is out in his bubble-mobile drawing' flies. 
- Let me talk to Liz. 
- No time. 
Gotta go, buddy-roo. 
Me and the family, we gotta ride. 
I think you know where we're all be headin'. 
Endsville, Thad. 
That place where all rail service terminates. 
Oh. In case you're wonderin', I cut the tracer on your phone here. 
I figure this is private business, just between you and me. 
The trace... 
Jesus, the phone trace. 
They heard my call, they wouldn't let her go. 
He's got Liz, Reggie. 
He's got my children. 
Be careful. 
Remember, he knows as much about you as you know about him. 
Don't let him seduce you. Don't... 
They've come to take one of us away, haven't they? 
- Which one? 
- The loser, of course. 
I do hope it's not you, Thaddeus. 
I'd hate to think of George Stark taking over your lecture group. 
- Why isn't he aware of them? 
- I don't know. 
- Let's take it as a good sign. 
- I thought you knew about this shit. 
I don't know about any of it. 
Nobody does, except the Almighty, and he seems to be on sabbatical. 
In the end, it's what you believe. 
I wish I had a talisman to give you, or a silver bullet or a stake to drive through the monster's heart. 
- But it's not that simple. 
- You've given me all I need. 
Thanks, Reggie. 
Good luck. 
It'll be interesting to see who's sitting in your office next week. 
- I'll be there. 
- Wear a red carnation so I know it's you. 
I got a dead officer. 
I call that trouble. 
We're pretty sure that Beaumont did it. 
- Why's that? 
- Well, he's outta here. 
He apparently took his family with him, unless he cut them up. 
He killed that doctor in Bangor. 
We got a positive ID from the receptionist. 
If he's heading to his place up there it would be real nice if you were there to stop his fucking clock. 
You got it. 
Fine. 
Come on. 
Oh, shit. 
Just keep on goin'. 
Keep on goin'. 
Me and Thad, we're gonna be doin' some collaborating', just like we always done. 
When it's over, if you haven't pissed me off too bad I might just decide to let you go. 
But you understand, it all depends on what kinda mood I'm in. 
If I'm in a good mood, a peaceful mood who knows what kinda turn things might take? 
When all this is over I might settle down up this way and I sure would want you to think kindly of me. 
I like it here. 
I purely do. 
Yeah, I could get real comfortable here. 
Dream on, motherfucker. 
This is no dream, Beth. 
Thad owes me. 
Maybe he knew how to write before I showed up but I taught him to write stuff people wanna read. 
Ain't no good writin' a thing if people don't wanna read it. 
That's why I says Thad owes me. 
So you come after me, you come after my children. 
You're a coward. 
You would do better not to say things like that. 
Hell, I didn't want any of this trouble. 
Believe it or not, I prefer to steer south of trouble. 
This writing' we gotta do, I tried to do it by myself. 
It was comin' along good, too. 
Well, then I developed this, uh physical problem. 
I guess you noticed. 
Well, don't worry. 
I'll be better soon. 
Thad's gonna make me well. 
All's he got to do is write this one last story and I'll be rockin' and rollin' again. 
Now, of course, he might start feelin' poorly and workin' so... close together and all he might just go and catch whatever this is that I got. 
That'd be a shame. 
I don't wish the boy any harm, truly I don't. 
I hope it turns out different. 
But I got the feelin' that one or the other of us is gonna have to fold his hand. 
And when it comes down to that it's better him than me. 
My God. 
- Oh, my God, you really are... 
- You're disturbing' my peaceful mood. 
You are disturbin' the peaceful frame of mind I'm in. 
You are disturbin' my peaceful frame of mind. 
You know, someone said that the world's a stage, and each of us must play a part. 
- Fate had me playing in love... 
- Liz. 
Oh, God, Liz. 
Are you all right? 
Huh? Are you OK? 
The kids. Where are the kids? 
Right here, Hoss. 
Hello, Thad. 
How are you, old buddy? 
- You look a little peaky. 
- You don't look so hot yourself. 
Lf... 
I do what you want me to do you promise not to hurt them. 
If I do what you want will you leave them alone? 
I will. 
I promise. 
You have my word, the word of a Southern man which is not given lightly. 
- Let me have them. 
- You can have one. 
Liz, I'm sorry. 
I'm so sorry for all this. 
- I'm gonna go upstairs with him. 
- No. 
Thad, you can't. 
We don't have a choice. 
He can't hurt me. He won't. 
But he can hurt you if you give him a reason. 
Don't be thinkin' about breakin' loose, don't be thinkin' about the telephone... 
Guess we're on the same wavelength. 
Ain't that right, Thad? 
Don't you see what's happening? 
Just look at him. 
He doesn't want help writing a book. 
He wants to take over your life. 
Can't you see that? 
I know what he wants. 
What I don't know and what he doesn't know is whether this'll really save him. 
I don't think it will save him. 
I think he's finished. 
You know why? 
Cos I don't want him around any more. 
There's only one way to find out who's finished and who's not. 
Ain't that right, Thad? 
Are you ready? 
Just waitin' on you. 
Yeah... 
I'll start with Machine stealing the police car. 
Yes, that's right. 
- Give me a cigarette. 
- I thought you quit. 
I did. 
Except for times like this. 
Times when me and you are workin' together. 
Why don't you try, George? 
You gotta break in. 
I'm scared, Hoss. 
Oh, you know the only way to do it is to do it. 
It's comin', Thad. 
It's comin' easy, it's comin' good. 
I can do it. 
I can do it. 
You shouldn't fuck with me, Hoss. 
Don't you know I can tell what you're thinkin'? 
Stop it, Thad. 
Stop it, or I'm gonna have to cut ya. 
You're not gonna cut me, George. 
You can't do shit to me and you know it. 
I can do some shit to the other folks around here. 
Yes, sir, I can do some real ugly shit to them. 
Sit down, Thad. 
Make it easy on yourself. 
Sit down and... shut your eyes. 
See if you can't just drift on off. 
You go to hell. 
They've come to take you away, George. 
Take you back to the devil. 
OK. You sit here. 
I gotta open the door now. 
I didn't want it to be like this, Hoss. 
I had a different sort of thing in mind. 
Yes, I did. 
They've come to write the ending, George. 
Is it gonna be your ending... or mine? 
Kinda clumsy there, George. 
I'm gonna... I'm gonna give you... one last chance here, Thad. 
Stop whatever it is that you're doin' here. 
I'm not doin' anything, Hoss. 
I'm just waitin' around to see how things turn out. 
Stop it, Thad. 
Stop it. 
I'm sorry, George. 
I can't. 
Neither can you. 
The ending, huh? 
Well, let's see how you like this ending, Hoss. 
No! 
Hurry up! 
- What the hell's goin' on? What is this? 
- They're upstairs. 
- Who? 
- He took them upstairs. 
- Where's Thad? 
- He's upstairs. 
He's with Stark. 
- Hold still! 
- He's got the kids upstairs. 
Liz, no! 
No! 
Wait! 
Wait here! 
Liz. 
And ready, here we go. Five, four, three, two- - 
Good evening. 
Tragedy in Taiwan. 
Disaster in Denmark. 
Mayhem in Malaysia. 
Those stories and more coming up later. 
Tonight's lead story : 
the computer game phenomenon distributed by alleged Russian Mafia leader Konstantine Konali has taken the world by storm. 
Out of the cold climates of Russia simply called" The Game." Ed? 
- Ed, what are you doing? 
- You gotta try this game. 
It's great. 
Not now, Ed. 
In the past six months" The Game" has generated over $ 1.5 billion in revenue... 
-... breaking all previous records. 
- Get him, you miserable bear! 
What makes this game stand out? 
This is the first time that a video game... 
-... has appealed to a youthful... - Ed! ... as well as a more sophisticated market. 
- Oh, sh- - -" The Game," available in cartridges as well as floppy disks for computer, has everybody playing. 
Take it, Lindsay, take it. 
The creator and mass-marketer of" The Game" is Konstantine Konali... 
-... allegedly head of the Russian Mafia. - No, no, no! 
Konali and- - What is he up to in Moscow? 
Get your hands off it. 
- Get your hands off the game! 
- I want that game! 
I'm not giving you my game! 
Give it to me! ED : 
You're through at this station. 
LINDSAY : You're through. 
Misha, take care of Skippy. 
Leonid, Leonid, Leonid. 
Enough living in the shadows. 
Someday this will all be mine! 
- This crime problem is out of hand. 
- Yes, Boris Nikolayevich. 
BORIS : We need help. 
I can recommend a man I met during the international conference. 
I understand he has already had dealings with Konali when Konali was in America. 
I will make this very clear. 
Can he help us get Konali? 
Yes, Boris Nikolayevich. 
He is just the man for the job. 
Keep me informed. 
There you are, son. 
How are the new recruits doing? 
It might be the best class ever, except for one man. 
- He's afraid of heights. 
- See what you can do for him. 
I find that sometimes the least likely cadets make the finest police officers. 
Commandant Lassard, throw us the ball. 
Off the scoreboard off the floor, off the wall off the redhead. 
Nothing but net. 
- Not bad. 
- I love this game. 
Connors. 
Where's Connors? 
Thanks, Connors. 
You fixed it. 
That's a classified police file. 
" The academy has assembled a special team for a mission to Moscow." 
I'd kill for that job. 
Webster's on the list. Why him? 
Because he graduated first in our class. 
Yeah, well can he do this? 
Yep. 
Can he do this? 
- Yep. 
- That's all I got. 
What are you doing? 
- Well, I've never been to Russia. 
- Okay, now put it back. 
Connors. 
Sergeant wants you. 
- Yeah. 
- Now. 
I'm so very, very glad to see you. 
The Moscow police have asked us to assist them... 
-... in apprehending Konstantine Konali. 
- Russkies? 
The godfather of Russian organized crime. 
Men.... 
Six years ago Konali helped to establish a branch of the Russian Mafia here in our country. 
Nearly got him then. 
Unfortunately, he slipped through our fingers and escaped back to Moscow where he continues his criminal activities aided by his brother Mikhail and pet snake Skippy. 
Home run! 
Now we get another chance to apprehend him. 
Man, what a wimp. 
Connors, get down here. 
You're never gonna pass the test. 
I've gotta pass. 
My father was a cop. 
His father was a cop. 
His father was a horse thief. 
- You got vertigo. 
Let's go. 
- Vertigo. 
I don't have vertigo. 
Yo, Connors, you want a doughnut? 
- Not bad. 
- Connors, let's face it. 
You don't have what it takes to be a cop. 
Take this to Commandant Lassard's office. 
- He'll sign off on your dismissal papers. 
- Bummer, dude. 
Now, I want you to meet a new addition to our team. 
- You must be Cadet Connors. - Hi. 
I'm very, very impressed by your file. 
- Cadet Kyle Connors. - Mm. 
Top grade average in the class. 
Sir, I have to tell you something. 
Congratulations. 
Thanks, but I'm not really the man in that file. 
Oh, I know what you mean. 
These reports never do give an accurate picture of who we really are. 
- Yes, but- - Ow! 
What the hell is this? 
Come on, come on. Come on. 
- Let's all pull together. - Okay. 
Okay, all together, on three! 
One, two, three! 
- Oh, God. 
- Sir! Ah! 
Captain Harris, our expert in surveillance, will be accompanying us. 
Team, we're all off to Russia to kick many, many butt-skis. 
Ah, Alexander Nikolaivitch. 
Men this is the honorable Commandant Alexander Nikolaivitch Rakov. 
- Sasha. 
- May I say it is an honor to have the great Commandant Lassard visiting our country? 
- Yes, you may. 
- May I kiss you again? 
- No, you may not. 
- May I escort you inside? 
Yes, you may. 
It is really wonderful to have you here in Russia. 
Please say hello to your lovely wife and tell her I'm sorry she's not here with you. 
Yes. 
Lieutenant Yuri Talinsky. 
Head of our organized crime unit. 
Please, don't underestimate the power of the Russian Mafia the most sadistic organization in the world. 
Katya. 
This is Sergeant Katya Sergei. 
She has been handpicked to be your guide and translator. 
Lieutenant Talinsky, I hold you personally responsible for the comfort and safety of the Americans and Commandant Lassard. 
- Yes, sir. 
- Now, Americans and Russians we must grab Konali like the insect that he is and we must then crush him! 
- God. 
- Make way. Jones. 
Jones. - Jones. 
Make way. 
Make way. - Oh! 
I am Captain Thaddeus Harris and in this case I have state-of-the-art American surveillance equipment. 
I'll have this Konali business wrapped up for you in a few days. 
Excuse me, Ricky. 
I must go to the toilet. 
Yes, of course. 
- Pardon me. Which is my car? 
- The one in front. 
The one in front. Oh, yeah. 
- What did he say? 
- Well, he said that you had a marvelous attitude and you're a pleasure to work with, sir. 
I'm going to keep my eye on you. 
The red zone is for Communist parking only. 
The one in front. 
The red zone is for Communist parking only. 
Oh, hello. 
Lieutenant Talinsky didn't tell me his family would be here. 
Very nice of you to come and greet me. 
Katrina, I want you to think of me as America's goodwill ambassador. 
And you think of me as translator and guide. 
Stop! 
Stop! 
I'm in deep borscht. 
Captain Callahan, 511. 
Sergeant Jones, 513. 
Sergeant Tackleberry, 514. 
Cadet Connors, 520. 
Captain Harris, 515. 
Not exactly a four-star hotel, is it? 
Well, we spend our police budget on fighting criminals not on pampering out-of-town visitors. 
Your government brought us here. 
They also bring in monkeys for zoo but we don't put them in four-star hotel either. 
Well, I just go check on Commandant Lassard. 
Lassard. Lassard. 
You! 
You. 
- Hm-mm. - You. 
I have job for you. 
Again. 
When you hear door, you say : 
" I'm in the bathroom. 
I'll meet you there." 
" I'm in the bathroom. 
Meet me there." 
Again. 
" I'm in the bathroom. 
I'll meet you there." 
" I'm in the bathroom. 
Meet you there." 
Come in. 
Again! 
" In the bathroom. 
Meet me there." 
Excuse me. Is the commandant in? Well, I just saw him. 
He's very tired and enjoying moment of rest. 
Thank you. 
I have to get to next level. 
- Looking for something, captain? 
- Bugs. 
You can never be too careful. 
- Call me paranoid. 
- You're paranoid. 
I'm down to one life. 
I can't make it. 
Can I show you a little trick? 
Watch. 
You just want the bear to go back three spaces. 
See? 
It makes it to next level. 
- I made it. 
Thank you. - Game. 
Good morning, everyone. 
I understand that your commandant will not be joining us today. 
However, we will proceed with briefing anyway. 
Konstantine Konali, Russian Mafia godfather. 
Jones! 
His brother and second-in-command, Mikhail Konali. 
Konstantine Konali is involved in extortion gambling, fencing jewelry, arms dealing. 
But he does not choose to involve himself... 
- Too much cabbage. -... in day-to-day running of operations which makes it rather difficult to catch him. 
However we know three places that he frequents regularly. 
One : his restaurant where he conducts meetings in back of office. 
Two : his dacha. 
And three : 
Hello. Hello. 
His warehouse, where he conducts legitimate video games business. 
Now we believe Konali is up to something big. 
Unfortunately, attempts to infiltrate his operations have failed but we will now work together and we will capture Konali. 
- Excuse me. - Ow! 
Adam. 
So good to see you. 
Thank you for inviting me, Mr. Konali. 
However, your delivery service leaves a little bit to be desired. 
I have the perfect plan, but I need your help. 
- My help? 
- I want you to design a program that will bypass any computer security system in the world letting me have access to secret files. 
You're talking about... 
-... a passkey? 
- Bingo. 
- Nothing like this exists. 
- Create it. 
I want to be able to tap into the world's banks manipulate the world's stock markets, know what heads of countries know. 
We could control the world! 
Louder, Misha. I don't think all of Moscow heard you. 
Even if I did create this passkey, how will you get it into their computers? 
I have already thought of that. 
You, my dear Adam, will design a new version of" The Game." 
We will call it" The New Game." 
And we will put the passkey in it. 
When you slip it into your computer, bada-bing! 
I will have access to impenetrable files. 
Pretty good, no? 
Lassard. 
Yankee police. 
Boys, watch them. 
I want to know their every move. 
Good luck, babushka. 
" In the bathroom. 
Meet you there. In the- - 
In the bathroom." Yes. 
Sir, we have to go now. 
- Sir? 
- In the bathroom. 
- Meet you there. 
- Is everything okay? 
The commandant is having some problems adjusting. 
- He's gonna meet us there. - Oh. 
You know, in America, funerals are in English. 
This where you live? 
Good day. 
I have a fish. 
He lives in a bowl too. 
You have a lovely, lovely apartment. 
Somehow, I feel quite at home here. 
A Russki police academy. 
What a joke. 
Da, da, da-da-da. 
In Lassard's absence, I will do all the talking. 
You'll say nothing, do nothing, watch your every move. 
Be on your toes. Any false move could embarrass us all. 
And don't trust these guys. 
Just because we're buddy-buddy with them now don't forget they were our sworn enemies just- - 
Just a little while ago. 
- Move it. Move it, move it. 
- Moron. 
The topic for today is police field tactics. 
The Russian and the American approach. 
American police. 
Good. 
Perhaps you can tell us about apprehending criminals. 
- Me? 
- You. You. 
Goodness' sakes. 
- Major. 
- Sergeant. 
Class, this is Sergeant Tackleberry. 
Okay. 
You know, as cops- - 
I don't have to tell you this. 
It's tough to uphold the law, but in the States we have to deal with constantly changing police regulations. 
I mean, take for example the excessive force issue. 
- I could use a volunteer. 
- Tackleberry, what are you doing? 
I am in charge here. 
Captain Harris, perhaps you should demonstrate. 
- Well, that's more like it. 
- Back in the old days there wasn't anything you couldn't do trying to apprehend a perpetrator. 
Take for example the highly effective chokehold. 
Tackleberry! 
Well, nowadays this is considered to be excessive force. 
Or the ever-dependable, always reliable PK-24 police baton which, with a single blow to the body say to the lower thigh.... 
Renders a subject completely incapacitated. 
But, no, no. 
Nowadays this too is considered to be excessive force. 
They want me to uphold the law but they tie my hands. 
Fortunately there's always Old Reliable. 
Why mess with success? 
Uh, thanks. 
Have you seen Lassard? 
I have had it with you losers. 
I will capture Konali because I use my head. 
- Yeah, right. 
- Think we can lose him? 
Excuse me. Is possible you help me? 
Sure. 
Why don't you guys run along and I'll catch up with you later. 
Uh-huh. Sure. 
Katrina, how can I help you? 
You ever want something so badly it hurts? 
- Yes. 
- And no matter how much you wait and hope and wait more, you don't get what you want? 
Well, yeah. 
But my advice is don't give up. Just go for it. 
- I want- - 
- Thattagirl. 
Follow your heart. 
- I want- - 
- Say it. 
- I want my vacation. - What's that? 
I wait three years. 
Three years. Then you Americans come. 
Talinsky, he assign me to you. - Mm-hm. 
- Now I can't go. 
I have plan. 
Connors, I don't leave you without anyone. 
Come. I select suitable replacement for you. 
She's best in department. 
Yeah, I'm sure she is. 
Look, all I know is Lassard disappear at airport. 
Organize search, find Lassard, but keep quiet. 
- What are you doing here? - Just browsing. 
Ah. 
Hey, Yuri, that translator, Katrina? 
Very good. 
She's excellent. 
All our people are excellent. 
For instance, this is Irina Petrovskaya. 
She is expert in forensics. 
She can tell you everything about person just by looking at one hair from head. 
My observations conclude this man is picky eater afraid of heights... 
-... and still a virgin. 
- What? 
I'm not a picky eater. 
Cadet Connors is also a forensics expert. 
Maybe you'd be so generous as to share with us your expertise. 
- This one puzzles us. 
We were able to remove only one fingerprint from scene of crime. 
This is our only clue to identity of criminal. 
Okey-dokey. 
No wonder you're puzzled. This glass is all cracked. 
Enough! 
Next assignment, Chernobyl. 
Excuse me, lieutenant but the chief said you and your men would be available to us. 
Absolutely, Captain Callahan, and I have just the men for you. 
These guys are cops? 
You get the feeling that we're not wanted here? 
I'll tell you what we need to do. 
- We need to let Konali know we're here. 
- On his turf. 
- Hit him where it hurts. 
- I like that. 
- Get in his face. 
- Kick some butt. 
Better get Katrina. 
Hey, bud. 
Nice work. 
It would be a shame to see this all go up in smoke. 
- How do you mean? 
- Accidents happen. 
Fire breaks out, beam gives way, workers- - 
Get out. 
Tell Konali I won't pay his extortion money. 
Hey, buddy. Commandant Lassard sends his regards. 
I can't tell you how it makes me feel to be received so very, very generously into your family. 
I'll take matters into my own hands. 
What is he doing? 
- Sir, would you like to have lunch? 
- Meet me in the bedroom. 
In the bathroom. 
- Sir? 
- Meet me there! 
Meet you there! Meet you there! 
This sewer stinks. 
So Americans leave without saying goodbye. 
Russians say goodbye without leaving. 
Oh, allow me. 
This went rancid. 
I promise you this : After today, Konali's gonna know this cop's in town. 
This is a typical Russian bathhouse. 
Okay. So this is Konali's sauna. 
It's just a front. 
People come here to fence stolen jewels. 
All right. 
Let's get naked. 
Come on. Come on. 
Hello, ladies. 
Hi. 
Nice place you got here. 
Freeze! 
You may resume whatever it is you were doing. 
Okay, okay. I should be right under Konali's restaurant. 
- Did you like the necklace? - Oh, yes, my pushki. 
- How much? 
- In fact, it is all that I am wearing. 
I decided that from now on I will only wear diamonds, diamonds and diamonds. 
- Yes. 
- Really? 
- l'm going to see you later, right? 
- Oh, I hope so. 
I'm going to bring you big surprise. 
- What? 
- How about Big Skippy? 
- I love Big Skippy. 
- And Little Skippy. 
No, not the little one. 
- He bothers me. 
- All right. I call you later. 
Hey, move it. Down in front. 
Mr. Konali, we've got bad news. 
It's American police. 
They're messing with our operation again. 
No more. You hear me? 
As of this moment I am putting a contract out on Lassard and his team! 
We squash them! 
My fish, Swimmy Lassard. 
He eats at this time every day. 
This will be fun, Vlady. 
Hey, you little punk, get lost! 
Hey, spread out! 
- You okay? - Yeah. 
Listen, just because they're good on bikes doesn't make them nice guys. 
Man, look at you. 
Come on. 
This one's for you, kid. 
Now, check this. 
There. 
Don't miss. 
Vlady, get up. 
I hate dogs. I'm gonna shoot every dog I ever see. 
What have we got here? 
A match with a red line through- - 
I've been here for 30 minutes. 
Shouldn't we see if Konali's inside? 
The Russian work ethic. 
You know, Katrina, you take this job too seriously. 
You have to learn to loosen up. 
I want to loosen up. 
Had vacation planned. Go to beach. 
Now I sit on bench here with you. 
You sure you speak with Talinsky? 
- Da, Talinsky. 
- I not understand. 
I should not be here. 
Well, you know, Katrina, sometimes you have to expect the unexpected. 
- I know your type. 
- My type? 
You just like to hunt fox. You like the chase. 
Katrina, go out with me tonight. 
Just one date. 
Give me a chance. 
I go out with you tonight. 
Excellent. 
Ladies and gentlemen. 
I would like to introduce to you the world-famous circus family, Zemskova. 
It's the Zemskov family. 
They're great. 
They've been doing this act for over 100 years. 
They look amazingly spry for their age. 
The Zemskov family passed the act down from grandfather to father to son and daughter. 
It's tradition. Keep secrets in family. 
Maybe that's one they should keep a secret. 
One more of those, it could be the end of the Zemskov family. 
And now Ivan Zemskovi will perform the impossible! 
The triple Salto Mortale. 
Ivan Zemskovi! 
I know. 
- Know what? 
- You lie. 
You tell me you get me off case as translator. 
- I'm sorry? 
- Instead you tell Talinsky I'm great translator. 
Translation : 
No vacation for me. 
So tonight I get even. Da? 
Let's hear it for the great artist family, Zemskov. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Igor and Andrusha. 
Excuse me. I have to go to the little clowns' room. 
Get him. 
No, no, no, no. 
No, no, I'd like to, but I- - 
No, no. 
I'll come back in five minutes. I will. I promise you. 
What is that? 
Is this gonna hurt? 
It's not even lubricated. 
Don't you clowns know when to stop? 
Let's do it. 
Don't be afraid. Close your eyes. 
Everybody, quiet! 
All right, listen here, Bozo- - 
Don't forget, you're the one that called us for help, buster. 
Well, excuse me, buster, but I didn't place the call. 
Great, great subway. 
Terrific. 
I mean, New York is a shithouse, but this is great. 
Well, have you been able to capture Konali? 
We were this close. 
Listen to me and use my equipment, you can capture him in two days. Na, na, na, na, na, na. 
- What about this Russian food? 
- You want borscht? 
We stop. 
I don't want any borscht. 
So now we're even. Da? 
Katrina, no. I had a wonderful time. 
All right. I had an awful time and I almost hurled but at least I got to spend some time with you. 
I had good time too. 
I'm sorry for what I did. I just- - 
I just wanted to keep you around. 
It's okay. 
What are you thinking about? 
What's Russian for" kiss me"? 
I whisper it. 
It doesn't seem to lose anything in the translation. 
You know, Konali he's done many bad things. 
But he brought you here. 
Where does Konali hang out at night? 
- The casino. 
- Suddenly I feel the need to gamble. 
No more bets, please. No more bets. 
Mr. Konali, always a pleasure to see you, sir. 
Jacquot, would you show Mr. Konali to his table? 
That's him. 
Place your bets. 
- Have a nice evening, sir. 
- What if he finds out you're cop? 
Oh, he will, when I arrest him. 
Bartender, margarita, please. 
- There you go, Monsieur Bond. 
- How about a Perrier in a bottle? 
Not bad, huh, Mr. Konali? 
Never before have I seen such an apparition. 
Let's get up. 
Right. 
Such a vision of womanhood. 
- Oh, yeah. 
- Mr. Konali, meet Debbie. 
Debbie. 
The name sings to me. 
Debbie 
- Yeah! - Ah. 
I'd say she's in. 
Be right back. 
- Could I get an autograph? 
- Hey, the boss is busy. 
- Sorry. This'll only take a second. 
- I said, the boss is busy. 
- Oh, God. 
- I tell you what. Why don't we.... 
Why don't we flip for it? 
If I win I get the autograph. 
If you win, I go away. 
Ready? 
Call it. 
If you could just make it out to Freddie. 
Hey, kid. 
- You got a job? - No. 
I'm just here for the herring. 
You should come work for me. 
Kid like you can go far. 
Do you offer a dental plan? 
I love this kid! 
Well, well, well. 
You can all go and play your little undercover games and when the time is right, I will arrest Konali. 
I want to show you picture of my baby. Uh-huh. 
This is the day I brought her home. Hmm. 
- Here she is at 10,000 miles. - Ooh. 
And this is after her first tune-up. 
Nice car. 
- Everything I touch I own. - Do you own or lease? 
You must have an awfully large payroll. 
Enough about me. 
Tell me is that your real hair? 
Everything about me is real. 
Really? 
Really. 
I want to know all about you. 
I find you fascinating. 
We have an appointment with destiny. 
But not tonight. 
When? 
Tomorrow. 
Coffee and cake. 
I send my car for you. 
Nice car. 
Yoo-hoo! Commandant Lassard! 
Come out, come out, wherever you are! 
- Give me a cigarette. 
- Did you see Konali's girlfriend? 
American-ski. 
Oh, nice tie-ski. 
Okay, get me some vodka. 
Damn! 
Why don't you try" from Russia with love"? 
" Russia with love." 
- Who are you? 
- None of your business. 
- What are you doing here? 
- Playing games. 
Hey, knock it off. 
Hey, cut it out. 
I know what you want but you can't have it. 
- What's wrong with you? 
- Did you know that I have been in this room for 72 hours straight with no food? 
Just me and the bear. 
No food? 
No. 
Nuts? 
- Your little game is over. 
- No, not yet. 
Tomorrow it'll all be over and Konali will have the power. 
Could you let me up now, please? 
I'm on kind of a deadline. 
And with Konali he takes" deadline" literally. 
I'm about to show the world something bigger than they have ever seen in their puny existence. 
But I want to show you my thing first. 
Is it something I could wrap around my neck? 
You're warm. 
Is it something I could play with? 
- You're getting warmer. 
- Oh, the suspense is killing me, Koni. 
- Tell me what it is. 
- It's a game! 
But not just any game. 
New version of old game... 
-... where I become big winner... - Oh. 
-... with the help of a secret key. 
- Secret key? 
Key? 
- What are you doing? - Uh.... 
Nothing. 
Boss wants his computer key from his office. 
It's at his other office in the restaurant. 
Bye. 
Whoa! That's a laser grid. 
We set one foot on that floor and every alarm in this place goes off. 
We've got to get to that cutoff switch over there. 
Hey, Tack, I got it. 
Okay, stand back. 
There's only one way to get this safe open. 
Wait a minute. 
You blow that thing, Konali's gonna know we were here. Hmm. 
What are we gonna do? 
You're amazing. 
There's no key in here. 
Keys! 
- Move, you little weasel. 
- Don't hurt me, okay- - 
- Hey! 
- Adam. 
- You have game? 
- Sure. 
I surpassed myself. 
This game will be even bigger than the last one. 
The world is mine. 
Go run off a dozen copies. 
We have to test it. 
Send it to some of our more dedicated game players : 
The president, the mayor Chief of Police Rakov. 
Can I get paid now? 
It's in the mail. 
And so are you. 
Oh, no. Not again. 
So... 
-... did you get any of Lassard's team? 
But you did get Lassard, yes? 
No. 
You bumbling nincompoops! 
You call yourselves men? 
There must be someone we can call. 
We haven't called the police. 
" To American police-ski : 
Bolshoi Theatre, tonight. 
Konali to buy stolen shipment of weapons. 
You must stop him. 
A friend." 
You know I don't speak Russian. 
But, sweetheart, it's a ballet. 
Hey, who wants some nuts? ! 
I got fresh nuts over here. 
There you go, mister. No, it didn't reach you long enough. 
Up, topside! 
I gotcha! 
There you go, Mr. Benny! 
- Sorry, lady. 
Who wants nuts? 
Right over here! 
Excuse me, babushka. I'm sorry. 
Excuse me, ma'am. 
- Ticket, please. - I don't have a ticket. 
- You need a ticket. 
- I'm an American police captain on assignment. 
I don't need a ticket. 
- I'm sorry. You must have ticket. 
- Don't you understand? 
I have to arrest somebody in there. 
You cannot arrest anyone without a ticket. 
You think so? 
Well, we'll just see about that. 
Excuse me. Make way. Make way. 
Must be a replacement. 
- Captain Harris! Get out of here. 
- Tackleberry! 
- Now! - What are you doing here? 
We've got to get off! 
Go! 
- Tackleberry! Konali! 
- Over here. 
- Go away! 
- We gotta get out of here! 
It's Konali! 
Come on, before he sees us! Come on! 
I saw Konali. Konali! 
I saw Konali! 
- That's Konali! 
Put me down! 
- I know, sir! I know, sir! 
- Konali! 
- I know! 
Freeze! 
You're under arrest. 
- What are you doing? 
- Arresting you. 
His butt is mine! 
I'll arrest him! 
For selling weapons to a known criminal. 
" Sunshine Kids." 
We've been set up. 
I am completely disgusted with you all. 
I am glad my good friend, Commandant Lassard, knew nothing about this. 
You are a disgrace to your uniforms and an embarrassment to me. 
Yuri, you know what to do. 
Do it. 
Ever since he return from Moscow I have been trying to capture Konali red-handed! 
And now you cowboys waltz in and smash my work to pieces! 
So now, if my police look at Konali wrong Konali will scream harassment! 
Americans you are hereby ordered to leave Russia. 
You understand? 
Get out! 
By 3 : 00 tomorrow! 
Or else! 
And as for you.... 
Sir? Wanna remind you the plane leaves at 3 : 00. 
In the bathroom. 
Sir? 
Something about that sign disturbs me. 
Mama. 
- What do you say we- -? 
- I'm way ahead of you. 
Sir? 
The other bag. The other- - Big bag-ski, big bag. 
Here, give it to me. Ow! 
Jones! 
Get me up! 
I have never been humiliated like this before! 
- So you've been humiliated other ways? 
- Just shut up, Jones. 
- Oh, yes, sir. 
- Connors! 
I thought you weren't coming. 
Didn't want my heart to be broken. Now it's too late. 
Callahan! 
They got Callahan! 
- Who the hell? 
- Callahan! 
- Connors! 
- Let's go! 
Don't worry about me! Take care of yourself! 
Go! Go! Go! 
Stop! Stop! Stop! 
Come on! 
Move-ski, move-ski, move-ski! Go! Go! 
Start it up! Go! 
Connors! 
Hang on, Connors! 
Shut up. 
Sergeant, can't you go any faster? 
Make this thing go! 
- He's going to get killed! 
- Nobody on my team gets killed... 
-... and that's an order! 
- I'm gonna get killed! 
Shake him off! 
- Tackleberry, give me your gun. 
- Yes, sir! 
This is a locator bullet. 
If we can hit the car with it, we can follow it anywhere. 
Yes, sir! 
Sasha, just get me one clean shot. 
Fire it, Tack. Fire it, let's go! 
Tackleberry, do something right for a change. 
Hit that car! 
Gotcha. 
- My buddy! Help! 
- Russkies! 
Russkies, in the motorcycle! 
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! 
Don't you understand English? 
Faster! 
What is this, a rodeo? 
Come on! 
Get closer! 
Connors! 
Connors! You better be glad you weren't killed, because I've got a plan. 
Hurry up. Move it, move it, move it! 
It works. 
Shamed. 
In front of my men! 
My peers! 
- My mommy! 
- Sorry about that. 
You. 
You will pay dearly for what you have done! 
I know. 
- You will marry me. - Wow. 
- Nice getup. 
- Thanks. 
- We're going to share everything. 
- Okay. 
Right in bull's-eye! 
I cannot believe your obstinacy! 
You could have had it all! 
Instead you betray me? 
I am going to bury you! 
- What? What? 
I'm busy! 
The game is in the police station computer. 
I'm in! Yes! 
Now for the key. 
My secret code. 
Turn around. 
- Three, four, five. 
- Yes. 
Everything ready at the warehouse? 
Got to go, cupcake. 
I get in touch with you later. 
See if you change your mind. 
Shoot him. 
Look, he left us play toy. 
I really need this. 
Tackleberry, crash the left window. 
Jones, Connors, Katrina, the right window. 
I'll go through the roof with the guys. 
- How about the door? 
- Well, move it, move it, move it. 
Take that, perverts! 
This next room has to be it. 
Crash through on the count of three. 
- One, two- - 
- Freeze! 
- Did anyone hear me say" three"? 
- I took care of it. 
- Where is he? 
- He's gone. 
Konali has left the building. 
Some command let him break into the police computer system. 
- If he gets in, we can't stop him. 
- His hacker was working on the game. 
- The key must be on it. 
- They're sending a shipment. 
- They're at the warehouse. 
- Let's go. 
Wait. Talinsky said if you're not on the 3 : 00 flight he'll arrest you. 
She's right. Let's go anyway. 
- No problem. 
- There, that's them! 
Go, go, go! 
- It's Talinsky. 
- Okay, it's a problem. 
Good. 
Good. 
In 48 hours," The New Game" will be in stores worldwide. 
How we gonna park? 
Sasha! 
Let's go! Let's go! 
Move it! Move it! Move it! 
All right, listen up! Listen up! 
Jones, give me those handcuffs. 
- Now, remember : 
I will arrest Konali. - Come on. 
Come on. Come on. 
Now, we attack on three. 
One, two- - 
Stop! Stop! Stop! 
Advertising spots will run consecutive days for the next three months. 
And A.M. Moscow wants you for a guest spot. 
Keep car running! 
- Where is master disk and passkey? 
- It's back inside your safe. 
In the restaurant office, as you requested. 
Good. 
Hey, Natasha. 
- I'll let you know if I need anything else. 
- You need a good attorney. 
Konstantine Konali, I arrest you in the name of the law. 
Stop. Everybody stop. 
- Put up gun! 
- I have arrested Konali. He's my prisoner. 
I will not be humiliated again like Bolshoi disaster. 
I've seen this before. 
I was playing with this in Rakov's office. 
My lawyer's going to sue for malicious prosecution intentional harassment and breaking a guy's heart. 
You're not going to sue anybody, because I am sending you to jail. 
- Do you have proof? 
- Proof? Proof. 
- Do we have proof? 
- Yes. 
Lieutenant, it's right under your nose. 
What's the number of the police computer? 
2913855. 
- That's top security- - 
- Type in" Konali." 
- Come on, Connors. 
Keep trying. - Try" Konstantine." 
- No. - Wait. 
It was five letters. 
I saw Konali type five letters. 
" Greed." 
Type in" greed." 
Classified information! 
Konali hid a program in his computer game. 
Nobody would know it was there. 
It allowed him access to the user's files. 
It's like stealing candy from a baby. 
Or top-secret information from a government. 
I finally got you, Konali. 
Captain Harris? 
Oh, no. 
A toast to my new Russian family. 
Excuse me. I have to go to the boys' room. 
Oh, excuse me. 
- I thought this was the bathroom. 
- You! 
- Lassard. 
- Why, yes. 
I'm flattered you recognize me. 
I'm not sure where- - 
- You can't have me! 
- I don't want you. 
- En garde! 
- On what? 
You have any last requests? 
God! God! Sonny Bono! 
Upsy-daisy! 
- You look familiar. 
- Don't play with me, Lassard. 
- Was it Paris? - No, not Paris. 
- Rome? 
- Not Rome. 
You think you can play me the fool? 
You'll never take me, Lassard! 
Not Konstantine Konali! 
I remember you now. 
You're under arrest for crimes against Russia and America and their citizens! 
Do it! 
- Today... 
- Today, today. 
-... we have shown... 
- We have shown, we have shown. 
-... people everywhere... 
- People everywhere- -... that Americans and Russians are brothers. 
I honor you and your team. 
Would Commandant Lassard please join me at podium? 
Comrade. 
And now, as a special tribute to our American friends I salute you all. 
( Whispers ) 
( Serbian ) Mr Minister. 
( Serbian ) I paged you. 
Yes? 
It couldn't wait until tomorrow at Parliament? 
No. 
( Speaks Russian ) Have our START friends given us permission to do our job yet? 
Yes, sir. 
Something wrong, Sergeant? 
I didn't join the Russian Army to dismantle it for the Americans, sir. 
None of us did... 
The world changes. 
We must change with it. 
Everything is ready? 
Everything is ready, General. 
Good luck. 
Thank you, sir. 
( Speaking Russian ) 
( Speaking Russian ) 
( Beeping ) 
( Russian ) What are they doing? 
( Russian ) 8 minutes, 40 seconds. 
No time to relax, boys. 
Oh, my God. 
( Speaks Russian ) 
Oh, God. Oh, my God. 
Calm down. 
We going to die. We're 15 km away. 
Under a mountain. 
- I want my money. 
- Be strong. You're an officer. 
- I'm so afraid. 
- No, no. 
It's time to be strong. 
I don't think I am. Pity. 
Take him away. 
What happened? 
I don't know, Dr Kelly. 
Please come with me, ma'am. 
( Chattering ) ( Man ) I've got estimates on cloud size comin' through on six. 
- What have we got? 
- NORAD's got R4 over sector 9877. 
It's been localised. 
60 degrees longitude, 50 lat. 
- What about NPIC? 
. - Blast 40 minutes ago in the Urals. 
Two trains collided. 
One was carrying warheads to Cherbynsk. 
Nice hair. 
Very au naturel. 
Nuclear forces have gone to DEFCON 3. 
NMCC thinks Russia will use this to veil troop movements into Chechnya. 
Not our problem. Estimates from Livermore? 
Five to seven hundred kilotons. 
Mark Appleton's looking for you. 
He's upstairs. 
- All current data on my desk? 
- Yes. I'm gonna need a minute. 
- Radiation pattern projections in? 
- Yeah, but those aren't confirmed. 
Confirm them. 
( Man ) Russia, what a fucking mess. 
I miss the Cold War. Get Essler down here now. 
I need a translator. 
Essler's gone. He quit to run JPL. 
- Who did we appoint? 
- My memo's on your desk. 
- Who the hell's in charge there? 
- Mark? 
Mark? Excuse me. 
Sorry. 
Forget Chernobyl. 
This is... 
This is huge. 
Dr Julia Kelly, Acting Chair, Nuclear Smuggling Group. 
- Terry Hamilton, Security Advisor. 
- We met last year. 
I'm briefing the President to explain how, with our START team there, an accident like this could happen. 
It wasn't an accident, sir. 
I'm sorry? 
We believe that train was carrying SS18s, which are One Point Safe. 
- What's she saying? 
- If you fire a bullet at the warhead there's a million-to-one chance of it going off. 
It must be ignited by its own trigger. 
Would you hold this, please? 
Here we have the satellite imagery. 
This is the two trains approaching, and here's the collision. 
Now check out the field of regard. 
These shots are at the same height cos they occurred at the same time. 
Look. The blast is two degrees higher after the satellites passed over. 
Time between shots? 
Between the train wreck and the detonation, 4 minutes. 
Somebody set that nuclear weapon off. 
This was a terrorist act. 
Full NSC briefing at 9 : 00am. 
The Russians' accident story will stand for now. 
No press leaks. Nobody shows up on Nightline. 
Doctor...? 
Kelly. 
I'm putting your group on point until I find a replacement. 
Yes, sir. 
OK, State, we're gonna need talking points for the President. 
We need to know who might want to detonate a nuke on Russian soil. 
General, I'll need a military liaison with Russian contacts. 
- You got it. 
- Oh, and General, make sure he's willing to take orders from a woman. 
' ( Woman ) Colonel Devoe, looking at events of May 18.' 
You were arrested in a bar brawl in a Moscow disco called... 
Night Crawler? Yes, ma'am, that's correct. 
You were in the company of a prostitute and a Russian army colonel named 
Dimitri Vertikoff? 
Dimitri and I went into the bar to try and buy some nerve gas off this ex-KGB guy that we had heard was selling black market surplus munitions to Iraq. 
The fight started because we'd run up a bit of a bar tab... 
I believe the exact amount was $ 5,200? 
Well, we had dinner, and I bought a couple of rounds. 
Colonel Vertikoff identified the KGB guy, and we were able to stop the nerve gas from getting to Iraq. 
So how do you repay a man like that? 
- Sports utility vehicle? 
- That's exactly right. 
Dimitri has a daughter who likes four-wheeling. 
I know this Ford guy who cut me a great deal on these Explorers. 
- I like the Bronco better... 
- Colonel, let's get this straight. 
You spent taxpayers' money to buy and ship a Ford Explorer 8,000 miles to the teenage daughter of a Russian colonel? 
. Yes, ma'am. 
Think of it as exporting goodwill. 
( Russian ) We never discussed detonating a bomb. 
If they discovered missing warheads they would have found us in hours. 
Now it will be days before they even reach the crash site. 
I hate these new ones. 
They don't seem real. He looks bug-eyed, deformed. 
They'll have the roads blocked. 
Your Russian is awful. 
Speak English. 
It was stupid, understand? 
Your friends made this deal, but this is my operation. 
Don't make me start thinking I don't need you. 
- They will never let us through. 
- Of course they will. 
Section 21-A, Nuclear Disaster Protocol. 
One, secure area. 
Two, control debris. 
Three, evacuate casualties. 
Huh? It was stupid. 
( Kelly ).. but they have the know-how and should not be ruled out. 
And moving on, we come to Shamil Basayev, a scientist. 
He claims responsibility for placing a canister of radioactive caesium in a park in Moscow last June. 
But his underworld ties suggest he could be part of a bigger operation. 
Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev. 
Chechen leader since the Russians murdered Dudayev. 
He has threatened to attack Federation nuclear power plants. 
There are others on our terrorist list, as outlined in your packet. 
Our reaction to the crisis is as follows. 
We have initiated a directive with the Nuclear Smuggling Group as hub. 
DIA and NRO. You have responsibility for primary SAT imagery... 
Excuse me, ma'am. 
I don't mean to interrupt. 
- Yes? - Um, these terrorists... 
Have they asked for anything, a list of demands? 
Russians out of Chechnya...? 
No, but it's not unusual for days, even weeks to go by before a claim of responsibility is made. 
- Yeah. - Air mob command is... 
Excuse me again. 
Ma'am. I'm sorry. 
That's a satellite shot of the trains just before they collided. 
Perhaps you should discuss Special Op possibilities? 
Right. General Garnett has Special Operations command at full alert. 
- Excuse me. 
- I'm sorry to keep interrupting. 
You see these blobs right here? 
Those are people jumping off the train before it crashes. 
Now look at that train. 
That's the one with the nuke. 
Nobody's jumpin' off that. 
They were already dead. 
( Man ) How many warheads were on the train? 
The Russians haven't confirmed yet. 
So we have no idea of potential yield? 
Are you suggesting this was a robbery? 
Whoever did this had access to Russian satellite positioning intel. 
That leaves out your Chechen rebels. 
( Murmuring ) 
I would like to point out that 1,500 people were killed last night. 
You don't do that unless you want to make a profound statement. 
Do you know how much a nuke is worth on the market? 
Minimum $ 200 million, cash. 
$ 200 million is a very profound statement. 
I'm sorry, ma'am. 
The detonation was a smoke screen. 
This was a hijacking, and whoever stole these things got off the bus a long way back. 
Well, we will certainly be considering your theory. 
Thank you very much. 
Well, it's just an opinion. 
Whoever has current data on the blast, I need it on my desk ASAP. 
( Woman ) You got it! 
Ken, try to get Russian Missile Command on the phone, please. 
- Anything on DIA? 
- We should have Russian intel soon. 
I need the START report. Not just the summaries. 
- Not just the abstracts, all of it. - I'm all over it. 
- And where is my military liaison? 
- Right here. 
Lieutenant Colonel Tom Devoe, reporting as ordered, ma'am. 
My enthusiasm sometimes gets the best of me. 
I hope that I didn't offend you in there. 
No, of course not. 
- Coffee? 
- I'd love some. 
Over there. 
( Ken ) Russian Missile Command's on line six. 
I'd like to reiterate our commitment to helping you find some answers. 
Yes. 
- No, I understand, General. 
- I brought you some coffee. 
Uh, that's right. 
We need to know exactly who was on that train. 
Uh, no, I am the man in charge. 
I report directly to the President. 
What do you want me to say? 
I don't see what has to do with anything. 
Yes, well... I see. 
No, I understand. 
I think... 
I mean I know I have a couple. 
All right. 
If you would be able to get back to me with the names of the men who were on the train and the number of warheads, 
- that would be wonderful. 
- In my office. 
And how long do you think that will take? 
Well, uh... 
I'll be expecting your call. 
Thank you. 
'CNN has confirmed the detonation of a nuclear device in Europe.' 
( Kelly ) We got the confirmation. 
- There were 10 warheads on board. 
- Forty men on board. 
- This is meaningless. 
- It's in Russian. 
Where did you learn to speak Russian? Princeton. 
The blue-blooded backbone of our country. 
- My father's a mailman. 
- Well, you'd never know. 
" Ilin, Kodoroff, Kulik, Levindovsky..." 
- Kodoroff? 
Aleksander Kodoroff? 
- Yeah. You know him? 
Yeah, I know him. 
God damn it! 
I don't know about these other guys, but General Kodoroff doesn't ride around on a nuclear transport train. 
Get me NMCC Intel, please. 
- It's like Ivana Trump on a subway. 
- Can you get my files? 
- Have that enhanced off the Urals. 
- Yes, sir. Sergeant. 
Kodoroff's under investigation for corruption, probably gonna be indicted. 
Gave a speech nine days ago in St Petersburg. 
Mostly nationalistic bluster, bemoaning the loss of empire and unity of the Slavic peoples. 
Family history, phone records, bank statements. 
Urinalysis from a Moscow traffic stop last month -.367. 
- I'm amazed he could turn the key. 
- That's a few cocktails. 
Saw his dentist Tuesday, dined with some attractive people on Friday. 
- Haven't been able to ID them yet. 
- Costello, you're slipping (! 
) - Oh, I'm gettin' old, sir. 
- You're not old. 
General Garnett's old. 
If you don't mind me askin', is Kodoroff involved? 
- We don't know. 
He was on the train. 
- You see, that's funny. 
Why? 
The General's got a Finnish mistress. 
- Lives in Helsinki. 
- Laina. 
The guy calls her every day like clockwork. 
- So? 
- Well, the thing is, if Kodoroff was on that train and he's so dead, who's calling Laina in Helsinki off some satellite over southern Russia? 
If that's a secure phone, I need it. 
Excuse me, General. 
If a top-ranking Russian general is involved, any intel we get from Moscow is either compromised... 
Palkawunic Vertikoff. 
-.. or a flat-out lie. 
- You're right. 
Dimitri, Tom Devoe. 
-' What do you want? 
' - Are you busy? 
I'm with two women. 
Call me back some other time. 
-' How are you guys holding' up? 
- The only virtue is, people are forgetting Chechnya. 
Yeah. 
Listen, I've got the troop manifest from that train. 
Alek Kodoroff got vaporised out there, did he? 
-' Yeah. What a shame.' 
- Yeah. 
So how is it he's calling Laina from a bird over southern Russian? 
How's he doin' that? 
'Are you still there? 
' 'You must be wrong about that, Tom. 
'Our figures indicate the fallout should have dissipated by then. 
'Let me fax you what we've got. 
Your number? 
Hold on. 
Fax number, please. Hang on. 
All right, 0-0-1-7-0-3... 
-.. 5-1-1-6-8. 
- Six-eight. 
I'm going to hang up now. Bye. 
Listen... 
That scared him. 
- Is this the fax? 
- Yes, sir. 
( Newscaster )' Information on the nuclear weapon incident in Russia'is still sketchy. 
'But we do have facts about the magnitude of the disaster. 
'Seismographs around the world detected the blast,'and the explosion was seen as far away as Lithuania'on the Baltic Sea. 
'Projections indicate the fallout'will affect all of Russia and northern Europe. 
'There's still no word on casualties. 
'President Clinton will issue a statement on this tragedy...' 
Vienna, 2 : 00pm, Bacherplatz. 
Why Vienna? 
- Kordech. 
- Maybe. 
Kordech is a front for the Russian Mafia in Vienna. 
And it's a trucking company. 
'Whether it was an accident or an act of terrorism remains a question.' 
I need NORAD's sector 9877 intel from the Urals, updated fallout patterns and troop movements from NATO humint. 
Honey-roasted. 
Think anybody'll mind if I stole a couple of bags? 
My old man will love the Executive Seal. 
Go ahead. 
Knock yourself out. 
Would you call Langley? 
We're waiting for Kodoroff's psych profile. 
He's an asshole. I'll save you a trip. 
Thanks. 
I'll go with the official version. 
OK. Officially, he's an asshole. 
He'll do anything for money, which is good, cos it makes him predictable. 
I'd say he's been anything but predictable. 
He took an order for an expensive, hard-to-find product, and he intends to make good on delivery. 
Supply and demand. Your area of expertise, Colonel? . 
That's the word on the Hill. 
You've been checkin' up on me. 
I like to know who I'm working with. 
I'd like to know something. 
You moved from Lawrence Livermore to the White House. 
So, first you build the bombs to blow up the entire world and now you wanna save it. 
Make up your mind, which is it? 
Well, I believe this week we're saving it. 
- So, it's really that simple? 
- It is to me, that simple. 
When you've been the boss for more than two weeks, you'll know that. 
Three weeks. 
You've done some checking' yourself. 
I like to know who I'm workin' with. 
You can run your charts and your theories all you want. 
In the field, this is how it works. 
The good guys, that's us, chase the bad guys, and they don't wear black hats. 
They are, however, all alike. 
They demand power and respect, and they'll pay top dollar to get it. 
And that is our highly motivated buyer. 
- What about other motivations? 
- Not important to me. 
Either way, there are people who don't care about money or respect, who believe killing innocent people is justified. 
For them it is about rage, frustration, hatred. 
They feel pain and want to share it. 
That does me no good. 
Let's deal with the facts at hand. 
23 hours ago, General Aleksander Kodoroff stole ten nuclear warheads. 
He's just a delivery boy. 
I'm not afraid of the man who wants ten nuclear weapons, Colonel. 
I'm terrified of the man who only wants one. 
( Chattering in Serbian ) 
( Serbian ) No, no, no. 
Listen. listen. 
Music should be like a language, child. 
Listen. 
Joy. 
Sadness, you understand? 
Changing a single note can turn joy to sorrow. Your turn. 
Professor? 
-' Hello? 
' - Dusan? 
It's me, Vlado. 
-' Is everything OK? 
' - Yes, we're on schedule. 
Brother, listen to me. 
I'm scared. 
( Devoe ) Hey, look who's the secret agent! 
Nice hat. 
You don't stand out at all! 
Dress shoes with khakis? 
- Look at you. 
- Leave me alone. 
Listen, whatever happens, deny it. 
OK. 
These are CDs for Tasha. 
You will not like them. 
How is she? 
16, and in love with a 20-year-old motorcross racer. 
- She said to say hello. 
- Send her my love. 
Is Kodoroff involved with Kordech? 
Dr Julia Kelly, Colonel Dimitri Vertikoff. 
Dr Kelly heads the Nuclear Smuggling Group. 
- With the White House. - With the White House. 
( Russian ) A beautiful woman with a PhD. 
You're out of your league. 
( Russian ) You have no idea, Colonel. 
That's good. 
I think we can do business, Dr Kelly. 
- Let's take a walk. 
- OK, let's take a walk. 
( Dimitri ) They sit here and drink. 
We might as well join them. 
( Kelly ) We've monitored Kordech for years, but it's always been a Mafia / ex-KGB operation. 
Till recently. 
You must see it in the context of my country. 
Kodoroff's generation of officers grew up in a crumbling system. 
Those pictures in your head of Russia, bread lines, shitty little apartments, ancient cars. 
Kodoroff and his friends made sure that it never applied to them. 
But now, even that system is crumbling. 
This was Kodoroff's way out, his big score. 
So we're here because YOU can't investigate Kordech? 
No, I can't investigate without alerting Kodoroff. 
Half the men used to be in my unit. 
Mr Dietrich Shummaker schedules all Russian shipping for Kordech. 
You have an appointment at 4 : 00. 
( Devoe ) Good, let's go see a man about a truck. 
That's gasoline! 
- Do you have them? 
- Yes. We have to begin immediately. 
Just remember the plan. 
- I'm Anthony Haden... 
- I'm Patty Carson. 
We go in, we get the information. 
then we get out. 
You call me Tony. 
Here we go. 
Hi, I'm Anthony Haden. 
This is my associate, Patty Carson. 
- Herr Shummaker's expecting us. 
- Please follow me. 
( Receptionist )'Make yourselves comfortable.' 
Thank you. 
Trucking business must be pretty good. 
I wonder what chateau in the Loire Valley these came from. 
Mr Haden? 
Welcome. 
Thank you very much for seeing us. 
This is my associate, Ms Carson. 
Nice place you have here. 
My taste is for the Italians but the German late Baroque was influenced by the Italians. 
Several of our paintings are Italian. 
- That's a Tiepolo. 
- Oh, yeah. 
I'm a big Leroy Neiman fan. 
Are you familiar with his work? 
- No, I'm afraid not. 
- No? Oh. 
- Please, come in. 
- Sure. 
To my office. 
- Oh, now, this is nice. 
- Thank you. 
Have a seat. 
How can we help you? 
I just wanted some information about trucking in Russia. 
I might not be the right man if you need to rent equipment. 
You're the head of transportation, right? 
The head? 
- No, I just do the scheduling. 
- Right. 
You're the guy who gets things done. 
Smart, put a German on it. 
Yes, well. 
As I said, how can I help you? 
Well, what we wanna know is, if I wanted to rent a vehicle to steal and transport nuclear weapons from somewhere, let's say, inside the Urals, would you be the guy to talk to? 
Would you be that guy? 
No, I'm afraid not. 
I believe our meeting is over. 
All right, thank you for... 
- Do you like Ford Explorers? 
- We have to go. 
Range Rovers, Land Cruisers? 
Mr Haden, will you leave the room? 
No! 
Should've taken the money, Hans! 
- Get up and get behind that desk. 
- You broke my nose! 
Not a word. 
Get the tape out of my briefcase. 
I won't shoot you unless I have to, and I'll feel bad about it. 
Sit down! 
Give me the tape. 
- I need the password. 
What is it? 
- Hang on. 
- The password. 
- No. 
All right, hang on. 
All right, Hans, we'll do it your way. 
How's the backhand? Password? 
- Hasselhoff. 
- Hasselhoff. 
Hasselhoff... 
How do you spell" Hasselhoff"? 
Way to go, Hans. 
Very brave. 
I'm in. 
I need the trucking invoices for the last seven days. 
All right. 
- This is your plan? 
- Yep. 
- This is your big plan? 
- This is... my plan! 
( Devoe ) Hurry up. 
- Come on. 
- Almost. Just logging off. 
- Stay on. 
Who cares? Leave it on. 
- Got it! 
Good. 
All right. 
Thank you very much, Herr Shummaker! 
- Go. Go! - Come on! 
Come on! 
- You get it? 
- Got it. 
- You all right? 
- No, I'm not all right! 
- Brilliant idea, smash his face in. 
- That's how things get done. 
A few bribes, it never happened at all, right? 
Check the seats, they go all the way back. 
- Oh, yeah. 
- Cool. 
- Embassy car. 
- CD player, bullet-proof glass, everything. 
Oh, shit! 
We... may have a problem. 
This will cost us. 
What do you have? 
- Eighty. 
- That's enough. I'll be back. 
Hold this. 
- So you think he set us up? 
- Who? 
- Your friend. 
- No. 
- How can you be so sure? 
- Because he's my friend. 
He needs more money. 
Give me... 
( Kelly ) Oh, my God! 
Out! 
Get up front. Get up front! 
Up front? 
- They're behind us. 
- How many of them? 
Two... three. 
Reach into that briefcase. Pull out an extra magazine. 
- Where is it? 
- In the briefcase. 
Damn it! 
Seat belt. 
Come on, what's wrong with you? 
What's wrong with you? ! 
What are you doing? 
Shit! 
No! NO! 
- Come on. 
- The invoices. - Come on! 
- The invoices! 
- Come on, God damn it! - No! 
Go, go! GO! 
Dimitri has a..... a daughter, Tasha. 
Sixteen. 
She lives in Rybinsk. 
I remember when she was three. 
She's... She's beautiful. 
It doesn't make sense, you know? 
You don't... kill a Dimitri Vertikoff. 
There are certain rules. 
Killing him isn't useful. 
Is it ever? 
I never watched anybody die before. 
( Computer )'Welcome. 
You've got mail.' 
I e-mailed Shummaker's files to my AOL account before I logged off. 
Did it work? 
Uh... yeah. 
We're looking for a vehicle hired in the Urals on about June 29. 
Right? 
- The truck's too small. - Yes. 
St Petersburg, one direction. 
Point of origin, Chelyabinsk. 
Registration number, 7056BM. 
Destination, Imisli 44E. 
That's Azerbaijan. 
It's just south of Russia. 
Five miles from fuckin' Iran! 
He crosses that border and those nukes are gone! 
We got a bank-routing code number. 
There's no client names." 44E", does that mean anything to you? 
- Shummaker put a private memo on the invoice. 
It can't be copied. 
This is Devoe, we have a target vehicle. It's a cargo truck. 
Registration 7056 Bravo Mike. 
It's travelling south from Chelyabinsk to Imisli in Azerbaijan. 
I am requesting a high-priority tasker. 
We've got nukes heading for Iran. 
What the hell is 44E? 
( Arguing in Serbian ) 
( Serbian ) Gentlemen, please. 
Zarko Preljevik has died. 
He never regained consciousness after being shot outside his church. 
His death is a tragic loss to his family, to his country, to our hopes of peace. 
We know you've avoided politics, Dusan, but you are the alternate. 
Your people need you. 
I am a Serb. 
I'm a Croat. 
I'm a Muslim. 
You will look at what I have done and say, 
" Of course. Why not? 
They are all animals." 
They have slaughtered each other for centuries. 
But the truth is, 
I am not a monster. 
I'm a human man. 
I'm just like you, whether you like it or not. 
( Man ) Hey, Rich, how you doing? 
We haven't seen you since the great scud hunt! 
- Captain Santiago, sir. 
- Hello, Captain. 
This is Lieutenant Beach. 
He'll run the operation from the ground. - Gentlemen, have you found him? 
- Damn close, sir. 
Giving them an average speed of 65 clicks, if their destination is Imisli and they take a direct route, we put them about here, in Dagestan. 
Still in Russia, below Makhackala on the Caspian Sea. 
We've looked at everything within a 200-square-mile area. 
We haven't found the truck. 
They're probably stuck here, in Kuma. 
Trucks are too close together. 
We can't get an angle on the plates. 
- What's going on down there? 
- Armenia and Azerbaijan fighting. 
Roads are clogged with refugees fleeing north. Ken? 
Get me a copy of Kodoroff's intel phone records. 
- What are you thinking? 
- I need an outside line. 
Somebody give me an outside line, please? 
Filthy fucking refugees. 
Azerbaijani, Georgian, Kazhakstani. 
Don't curse them. 
I don't care what bitch gave birth to them, Muslim, Serb. 
I don't hate them for who they are. 
I hate them because they are poor. 
-' Alek, how's the ride down there? ' - Who is this? 
Doesn't traffic drive you nuts? 
- Who the fuck is this? -' It's Tom Devoe. 
How you been? ' 
You still humping' that Finnish stewardess with the bad skin? 
Are you still trading stolen cars on the black market? 
Hey, Alek, you watched CNN during Desert Storm. 
Remember those shots from the nose of the missiles slammin' into those trucks? 
'Remember that picture? 
'How it kept gettin' closer and bigger on the screen? ' 
You could just about see the faces of those drivers, and then... 
Zap, the picture went dead. 
We didn't see what happened next. 
Well, guess what, Alek? 
You will, you son of a bitch. Shit. 
Get out of the way! 
- I guess that upset him. 
- Can you get an angle? 
He rear-ends some guy, can it detonate that nuke? 
As long as no one opens the primary, it's OK. 
Come on, sweetie. Come on. 
It's coming. 
70-56 Bravo Mike. That's it. 
How long until the satellite's out of range? 
- One hour, 46 minutes. 
- Contact Russian command. 
Give them the location of the truck. 
Boom! 
- OK, go. 
You go. - No, you go first. 
I talked to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. 
- Department's draggin' their feet. 
- I was talking to the President. He says the Russians have to manage it. 
No, we have the advantage! 
The Russians say they are handling this. 
The Russians couldn't find snow in the middle of fuckin' winter. 
When that satellite is out of range, those nukes are gone. 
It's only jet fuel. 
- Get up into NATO. 
- Good for you. 
Let's go. 
Rich? No, wait. 
Wait, Colonel. 
With Russia determined to handle this take no action without authorisation. 
Do you think I'm some stupid son of a bitch? 
No, I don't think you're stupid. 
You're a talented soldier with bad impulse control. 
I don't want an international incident 
- because of a personal agenda. 
- My personal agenda is my business. 
Now you are not in Washington. 
You are in the real world, and there are nuclear arms heading for Iran. 
So whether you agree with me or not, get me authorised! 
( Serbian ) We must go, Dusan. 
Cobra Three, this is Tango Six. 
What have we got? ( Kelly )' Russian command has been notified of target's location. 
'Proceed and await instructions.' 
- Does NRO have anything for us? 
- They got us on standby. 
How much time are we looking at? 
We can track' em for 45 minutes. 
We'll alert IFOR at Bazta checkpoint. 
They have to pass through there. 
Put that away. 
( Russian ) Step out of the truck, please. 
I'm sorry, General. 
We've been ordered to check all vehicles. 
We're just carrying medical supplies. 
Let us through. I'm sorry sir, but I have orders. 
Look at your code book, Sergeant. 
Today's authorisation code is... 
Yes, but I still have to search the truck. 
Name and unit, you hear me? 
- I'm sorry, General. 
Go ahead. 
Stop. 
I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to get out of the truck. 
Get out of the truck immediately! 
Of course. 
( Reporter ) There's been a setback in the ongoing effort to secure peace in the former Yugoslavia. 
So far, no one has taken responsibility for the killing of the Bosnian-Serb minister, Zarko Preljevik, who was assassinated in a Sarajevo churchyard. 
Word of his death sent shock waves through the international community. 
He was considered a crucial player in the peace talks scheduled to begin this week in New York. 
Reporting live from Sarajevo, this is Jean Rogers for CNN. 
Forty-four E. 
Forty-fourth parallel runs through... 
Sarajevo. 
Where's that bank number? 
The one off the Kordech invoice? 
- Check it against banks in Sarajevo. 
- Doctor? - What's going on? 
- A Russian roadblock. 
They're all dead, ma'am. 
I think they're all dead. 
( Devoe )' Cobra Three, they got' em? 
Negative. How much longer do we have them on satellite? 
Less than 10 minutes. 
Alert the Russians of the truck's position and that they have men down. 
Stand by to track. 
( Devoe )'We've reached Federation airspace.' 
Running out of time, suggest we go. 
Negative. Do not proceed without authorisation. 
- Any Russians troops in the area? 
- Negative. 
( Devoe )' We're gonna lose' em. 
We have to go.' 
Get me a secure link to NMCC. 
Negative, Six. 
Do not proceed without authorisation. 
You will not proceed. 
When we lose the satellite, do we have other eyes? 
( Kelly )' Sir, target vehicle is approaching Iranian border.' 
Requesting permission to enter Russian airspace and take it out. 
In your estimation, is this our only course of action? 
Based on available intel, no Russian forces in place, our analysis of the satellite... 
'I'm not asking for analysis, I'm asking for a decision.' 
Must advise we go, sir. 
Dr Kelly, if there are nuclear weapons on that truck and the Russians can't interdict, are you willing to risk a war to stop it? 
Yes, sir. 
Yes, sir, I am. 
'Six, this is Cobra Three. 
We have a go.' 
Avoid casualties. Secure the target vehicle. Detain anyone inside. 
Copy. 
Six to task force. We're cleared. 
Let's rock and roll! 
'This is Red Dog Pack to Three. 
Execute.' 
Why aren't they finished back there? 
Unidentified aircraft, you have entered Russian airspace. 
Commander... Russian control tower, this is Air Force 53762. 
'A flight of three US Airforce helicopters'in pursuit of stolen nuclear weapons. 
'Request a weapons-hold status.' 
Three American Air Force helicopters. 
Low altitude, approximately 175 kilometres per hour. 
Requesting weapons-hold status. 
Intrusion section 187. 
Activate tracking and firing sequence. 
All batteries... 
On my command. You must return to Turkish airspace, US Air Force. 
'Your intrusion is not authorised. You have crossed international line.' 
Battery one tracking. 
They've locked on to us. 
Battery two tracking. 
A second battery's locked on to us. 
Get Southern Command on the line. 
Tell them we have unauthorised entry. 
'This is Air Force 53762. We are in pursuit of stolen nuclear weapons'on their way to Iran.' 
Repeat. Put your weapons on hold. 
Batteries tracking. 
Reverse course immediately, or we will begin to fire. 
This is Red Dog 3. 
We're lit up like a Christmas tree. 
'This is Air Force 53762.' 
Those weapons could be going to Chechnya or Georgia. 
We repeat. Put your weapons on hold. 
- They haven't answered yet. 
- We'll lose track in 6 seconds. 
Take them out. 
Here they come! 
( Devoe )' Number One is down.' 
'We have a downed aircraft two miles east of checkpoint four.' 
- Number Three, acknowledge. 
- This is Red Dog Three. 
'Do you see the aircraft or any survivors? 
' Negative. The whole forest is up in flames. 
Number Three, duck behind the hill. Behind the hill! 
- How many men on that chopper? 
( Devoe )'Cobra Three, we're out of range. 
'Target is two miles out.' 
Here it is. 
What's he doing? 
- Will it work? 
- It can be activated by one man. 
It will render a nuclear yield of two kilotons. 
- Why is he doing that now? 
- Because that was the deal. 
One warhead for us, to do with as we wish. 
After I get my money. 
Helicopters! 
Gentlemen, whatever you do... do not shoot any civilians. 
Amerikanze. 
Take out the road. 
Rig me a heavy lift line. 
Those fuckers you can shoot. 
Let's get him out! 
Where are they goin', Alek? 
Where are they goin'? 
Fuck you. 
Get it down. 
Lower it. 
Heavy line! Let's go! 
- Grab it and get out! 
- Drop a cable! 
Bring it down. More! 
More! 
Come on, get on! 
- More! 
- Lower it! We gotta lower it! 
Go! 
We're clear! All right, sweep' em. Open' em up. 
Let's go. Let's go. 
- You all right, sir? 
- Yeah. Open' em up. Let's go. 
( Devoe ) Give me a radio. Cobra Three, are you there? 
Six, what happened? 
One assault aircraft is gone. 
Nine men are dead. 
Kodoroff is dead, and we have recovered eight nuclear warheads 
- in their containers. 
- That's not enough. 
- What? 
-' That's not enough damn warheads.' 
- For once, say something nice. 
- It was an SS18, ten warheads. 
One detonated, eight there. 
That leaves one unaccounted for. 
Colonel Devoe, there's somebody alive down here! 
Hold on a minute. 
Take this. 
Motherfuck! 
God damn it! 
We got a live one, Colonel. 
- Do you speak English? 
- Yes, I went to Harvard. 
Go, Crimson! 
Help me up, please. 
- Where's the other warhead? 
- Bring me up. 
Listen. 
You are gonna die unless you tell me where the other warhead is. 
- I don't know. He took it. 
- Who? 
I don't know his name. 
He's with the ones who arranged this. 
- Kodoroff? 
- No, he just handled the money. 
It was the other one! 
He made me dismantle the primary, make it mobile. 
- How? 
- It's in his backpack. 
Help me up, please? 
Kelly? 
A guy got away with a bomb. 
'Copy, Devoe. 
All right, come on back.' 
Got it. 
The bank account on the Kordech invoice. 
Registered to an address in Grbavica, a Serbian suburb of Sarajevo. 
Good. 
Get this information to IFOR. 
Tell them to proceed with caution. 
Where are you going? 
( Serbian ) You made it. 
I told you I would. 
Is it heavy? 
We must go. 
- Are you all right? 
- I've been better. 
How about you? 
I've been better. 
We traced the money to a man named Vlado Mirich. 
IFOR found a tape in his apartment. 
They're sending it to us now. 
They say it has a terrorist message on it. 
Colonel, the guy you caught is Dr Amir Taraki. 
Pakistani. 
PhD in astrophysics. 
Educated at Harvard. 
That's right. 
We educated half the world's terrorists. 
Tell me exactly what he said. 
He took the primary from the warhead and put it in a backpack. 
The primary is full of plutonium. 
It could take out ten city blocks and kill 100,000 people in a densely populated area like Sarajevo. 
( Mirich )' You will look at what I have done and say, 
'" Of course, why not? 
They are all animals. 
'" They have slaughtered each other for centuries." 
'But the truth is, 
'I'm not a monster. 
'I'm a human man. 
I'm just like you,'whether you like it or not. 
'For years, we have tried to live together'until a war was waged on us. 
'On all of us. 
'A war waged by our own leaders. 
'And who supplied the Serb cluster bombs,'the Croatian tanks,'the Muslim artillery shells'that killed our sons and daughters? 
'It was the governments of the West'who drew the boundaries of our countries. 
'Sometimes in ink, sometimes in blood. 
'The blood of our people. 
'And now, you dispatch your peacekeepers'to write our destiny again. 
'We can never accept this peace that leaves us'with nothing but pain. 
'Pain the peacemakers must be made to feel.

'So now you know. 
Now you must understand. 
'Leave us to find our own destiny. 
'May God have mercy on us all.' 
IFOR can shut down Bosnia. 
He'll never get into Sarajevo. 
Wait, he's not going there. 
We weren't meant to find this until after he'd detonated the bomb. 
" Pain the peacemakers must be made to feel." 
The peacemakers aren't in Bosnia. 
They're in Europe and the US. 
- They're signing a treaty this week. 
- Tomorrow at the UN. 
- What's the address? 
- By the river, east side. 
Forty-fourth Street, 44E. 
He's goin' to New York. 
What've you got? 
We can only close the airport with a Nuclear Emergency Response Plan. 
- It has to come from her. 
- I'll give it to her. 
I wanted to know who they were. 
Secure line to NMCC. 
This is Dr Julia Kelly. 
I am issuing a presidential directive for a Federal Nuclear Emergency Plan. 
We have a possible weapon of mass destruction coming into the United States by unknown terrorist or terrorists. 
- Check in the rear. 
- Yes, sir. 
Commencing diplomatic evacuation. 
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please. 
I'm with the UN. 
We've been informed of a threat to the treaty signing. 
We must get you off this plane to ensure your safety. 
If you would all please stand up. 
Thank you. 
Move to the exits at the rear and front of the aircraft in an orderly fashion. 
- Glad you made it. 
Coffee? 
- No, thank you. 
- I took a few Stay-Awakes earlier. 
- Dr Kelly? 
- I'm fine. 
- How many did she take? 
This is Mark Carey, Energy. 
Here, Special Agent in Charge, David Branigan, FBI. 
We're running NYPD and Agency response from here in co-ordination with DOE. 
- Evacuation plans? 
- National Guard. 
- What about NEST? 
- Energy has containment teams on alert in Battery Park. 
We're running casualty scenarios. 
Initial blast would throw 60 rads of radiation out 3 miles. 
That's most of lower Manhattan and Queens. 
2.5 to 3 million people, 50 % survival rate. 
Monitor wind patterns, and we need radiation detectors, ground and air. 
- Intel report from IFOR. 
- Let me see that. 
Vlado Mirich, Bosnian-Serb, radical. 
Been missing for about a week. 
Father fought with Tito. 
Has a half-brother who was a pianist in Sarajevo. 
He's been arrested 3 times for smuggling and black-marketeering. 
- It's gotta be him. 
- No, something's wrong. 
The man in the tape. 
He's no black marketeer and he's not a nationalist. 
He said," I am a Serb, a Croat and a Muslim". 
He's holding everybody responsible. The background doesn't fit. 
I've got a V Mirich on SwissAir Flight 1204 from Zurich to Kennedy. 
- Arriving when? 
- 7 minutes ago. 
Call JFK. Send' em a picture. 
Excuse me! 
Cover all the exits. 
Nobody gets out. 
Nobody! 
- SwissAir, 1204, non-residents. 
- Station 20. 
( Kelly ) He's not here. 
- He's not here! 
- We got a possible ID at desk 7. 
It's the far corner. 
Excuse me. 
Vlado Mirich? 
Yes? 
Who the hell is this? 
All right. 
Passport's fake. Said he bought it in Sarajevo. 
We've been able to detain eight men with passports issued by countries of the former Yugoslavia. 
- None matches your description. 
- Where the hell is he? 
- Eight? 
- Not including the delegations. 
- What? 
- They don't go through customs. 
In all, must be a couple of hundred. 
No, ma'am. 
We are talking about a terrorist situation. 
We need to detain the entire delegation. 
These are diplomats, guests of the US. I can't order them around. 
- Then I need names and room numbers. 
- We're looking for Vlado Mirich. 
This man isn't named Vlado Mirich. 
This is Dusan Gavrich. 
He's with the Bosnian-Serb delegation. 
Their minister was assassinated last week. 
He took his place. 
The brother. 
Go! 
Oh, shit. 
Diplomatic papers. 
They never even searched it. 
Still warm. 
Move. 
Nina! 
Nina! 
Help me! 
Help me! 
Help my child! 
Please help me! 
East 44th Street. 
- DOE, got anything yet? 
- Choppers are up. 
The backpack will be leaking radiation so we can locate him within a 3 to 4 block area. 
Set up roadblocks here. 
We'll close off 2nd. 
Funnel him down 43rd. 
Deploy snipers between 1st and 2nd. 
Command Centre. 
General, we have to close down the east side of Second Avenue from 55th to 42nd and the north side of 42nd from Sixth to the river. 
( Devoe )' We're gonna be in position at the UN. 
'Instruct all field agents, all snipers,'subject cannot be aware of the hunt.' 
Something big at UN today. 
Traffic bad all morning. 
- ( Kelly )' Chopper One, anything? ' - Negative. 
HQ, Kelly. We're gonna work our way south into the funnel. 
Suggest stopping anyone with a backpack north of 55th. 
Roger. 
How soon will you get to the UN? 
This is a national emergency. 
- Get over here and spread' em. 
- Put your hands on your head! 
Who are the fascists now, huh? 
Come on! 
OK, guys, let's move it out. 
Come on. Let's move it. 
- What the hell is this? 
- We have instructions to... 
It looks like Desert Storm! 
Get these men outta here now! 
- Colonel. - Yeah. 
Where's the containment trucks? 
- It's gridlocked. 
- Where are they? 
There's a radiation source between Third and Second, 54th and 46th. 
- Can you be more precise, DOE? 
-' Not at this altitude.' 
Keep an open channel. 
When we locate him, go with the NEST team. 
HRT Command, put me direct with your closest shooter. 
-' Hunter One, copy.' - This is One. 
( Devoe )'Expect he's comin' your way, One.' 
- ( One )' Do we have a green light? 
' - ( Devoe )' Affirmative.' 
( Officer ) Get outside the barriers, folks. 
I think he's between First and Second, probably below 46th. 
All positions, do you see target? 
No, sir. Not me. 
Come on. 
Come to Papa. 
This is Four. 
Target acquired. 
Three hundred metres. 
Not clean. 
Too many friendlies. 
- This is Leader. 
Take the shot. 
- There's a child, a family. 
Acknowledged. Take the shot. 
Shoot him. 
Come on. 
Four, this is Leader. 
I repeat, take the shot. 
Take the shot! 
Shoot him! 
Take the shot! 
Oh, God. 
God damn it! 
Somebody shoot him! 
This is One. 
I have target acquired. 
Four hundred yards, inbound. 
No shot. 
Should open at 43rd. 
FBI! 
Take it easy, all right? 
Just get outta here. 
Dispatch, this is 1501. 
I need backup on 43rd Street as soon as you can get it for me. 
Leader, this is One. 
Waiting for target to clear. 
You with the backpack, get your hands up. 
Get your hands up! 
I'm a diplomat with the United Nations. 
I must be allowed to pass. 
Leader, I've lost him. 
He stopped. 
- What? 
- He went behind some trees. 
He's gotta be there. Reacquire. 
Move if you have to. 
- What's in the backpack? Cuffs. 
- You got it. 
- Can you engage, One? - Negative. 
Somebody shooting. 
Corner of 43rd and Second. 
Is he down? 
Is he down? 
( One )' Negative. 
They're southbound, toward 42nd.' 
Stay in contact with the containment trucks and have them ready to move on my command. 
- Where are you from? 
- Philadelphia. 
Give me the keys. 
Out of the way! DOE, you have him? 
He's eastbound on 42nd. 
Get out of the way! 
Go! 
- East of Second, off 41st. - He went down there! 
Stay behind me! 
Drop your weapon, and show me your fuckin' hands. 
We got him. 
Alley off 41st. 
- You all right? - Yeah. 
( Radio )' The signal just quit. 
He's gotta be indoors.' 
Oh, Vlado. 
Move! 
- ( Screaming ) - Move! Move! 
Move! 
- Anybody have him? - ( Radio )' Negative. 
Nothing.' 
- DOE, what have you got? 
-' Still picking up an energy source'somewhere in the area. 
We're circling back now.' 
He'll never make it to the UN. No need to. 
He's got a nuclear weapon. 
He just sits down behind a dumpster and destroys half of Manhattan. 
He doesn't wanna die behind a dumpster. 
He wants his death to mean something. Fan out. 
We've got a new perimeter. 
He's gotta be within 200 yards. 
- Look for blood. 
- There's no sign, Colonel, he probably ducked into a building. 
- Keep looking. 
-' We'll circle a six-block area.' 
( Choir singing ) 
Devoe! 
Listen. 
Go! Go! 
Father, take these children. Move it! 
( Priest ) Come on, quickly, girls. 
Come on. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. 
Let's go. 
Go, go, go, go. 
You cannot stop this. 
Never! 
OK. 
OK, just... just stay still. 
Stay there. 
Stay still. 
It's OK. 
You don't wanna die like this. 
Tell me about the bomb. 
Is it on the trigger? 
Is it on a timer? 
Is it activated? 
Come on, talk to me. 
No! 
Who decided for my wife? 
My child, murdered. Huh? 
For what? 
For what? 
For breathing? 
For smiling? 
And now, I am left. 
Who decides for me? 
Mr Gavrich, what is it you want? 
I want it to be..... like it was. 
Sir, it's not our war. 
- It is now. - No! 
Son of a bitch. 
Where the hell is NEST? 
- It's on a timer. 
- Listen, the bomb's on a timer. 
Ken, where the hell are they? 
- I don't know. 
- Ken, tell me NEST is here. 
'Affirmative. 
They'll be there in four minutes.' 
They're not gonna make it. 
They're not gonna make it. 
OK, you're gonna have to do this. Understand? 
Look at this, what do you see? 
Take a look at this and tell me what you see! 
An SS18 primary with a plutonium core. 
A bomb inside a bomb. 
It has a capacitor-relay detonator, double pull, double throw. 
The only way of knowing is to open it up. 
What? 
Let's move it into the chapel. 
Get it off him. Get it off! Hang on. 
We got a trip wire. 
We'll move the man and the bomb. 
All at once. 
Here we go. Ready? 
Go. 
Let's go! 
Careful! 
Get the gate! - Why in here? 
- It'll help contain the radiation. 
Get out of the church and evacuate as many people as you can. 
- I need something for the screws. - Here. 
- Anything. 
Quick! 
- Go, go. 
Devoe, get out of here. 
OK, I'll be in the truck! ( Chuckles ) 
The plutonium core is surrounded by explosive panels. 
Uh, give me the knife. 
I need the knife back. 
If we can separate one of the panels, we may be able to blow up the outer bomb without... the core going to nuclear yield. 
You're gonna blow this up. 
You're gonna blow up the bomb? 
You know what you're doin', right? 
You've done this before? 
Defused stolen nuclear primaries jerry-rigged by Pakistanis? 
No. 
Ah, damn! 
I need your gun. Give me the gun, I need the gun. 
Go. 
Easy, easy, easy, easy! 
It's all right. 
( Devoe ) 14... 13... 12... 
Let's go! 
It won't move! 
10... 9... 8... 
Come on! 
7... 6... 5. 
Go, go, go, go! 
Come here. 
Are you OK? 
Hey, are you OK? Come here. 
Come here. 
Come here, hey. 
- You OK? 
- I think so. 
Hey, listen, you're OK. 
All right? 
Yeah, go. Go. 
Julia, Julia! 
Julia! 
Julia! 
- So, they give you any new medals? - Yes, they did. 
- Well, you worked hard for them. 
- Thank you. 
We've got kind of a tradition over at military ops. 
Whenever combatants come back from the field in one piece, we... buy each other a beer. 
- You made that up. 
- Yes, I did. 
Well, um... 
I got ten more to go. 
I'll wait. 
You can ´ t... have my daughter. 
No. 
No. Stay away! 
Stay out of here. 
Stay out! 
She ´ s my daughter! 
Stay away. 
Mommy. 
Mommy, come and play with me... in my room. 
Right now, Mommy. 
Okay? 
I got an idea. 
No! 
Let go of me! 
No! 
Who will protect her? 
No! 
Let me go! 
Rachel! 
Rachel! 
No! 
I can ´ t leave her! 
I have to protect her! 
Rachel! 
Okay, Rachel... your momma ´ s gotta go somewhere to get some rest so she ´ ll feel better, okay? 
Are you okay? 
is your dad around? 
I don ´ t have a dad. 
Okay, here ´ s what we ´ re gonna do. 
We ´ re gonna take you someplace real nice... with a really nice family until we get this sorted out, okay? 
Rachel! 
Stop it! 
Stop! 
Stop it! 
Hello. lt ´ s Monday morning. 
Time to get up and go to work. 
But never fear because the Moneyman is here... 
Sorry, Walt. 
- Are you workin ´ tonight? 
- They moved me to the graveyard shift. 
Was the dog in the house last night? 
He ´ s allowed in the morning. 
Daytime ´ s okay, but not at night. 
I only let him in this morning. 
There ´ s no juice. 
We ´ re out of a lot of things. 
I heard dog noises last night when I was trying to sleep. 
Walter was not in the house last night. 
That voice! 
As long as you ´ re under this roof... you ´ ll respect us as your parents and treat us like that. 
Sorry. 
Take it easy, Boyd. 
She might not be with us much longer. 
Your mom ´ s making progress, right? 
On her new medication, the Clozaril? 
Where are we gonna make up that 300 bucks a month? 
May I be excused? 
Well, hello. 
Oh, she speaks. 
Her mouth opens, and sounds come out. 
She didn ´ t call all weekend. 
I figured her voice was gone. 
What ´ s wrong? 
Foster dad being a pain again? 
Yeah. 
Why are you so weirdly happy? 
Do I look any different? 
Do you look any- - 
Oh, my God! 
You did it? 
Yeah. 
Who? 
You wouldn ´ t believe me if I just told you, so I ´ m bringing him to lunch. 
- You suck. 
- Oh, love you too. 
- Best blood. 
- One. Two. Three. 
Four. 
Are you ready to beat beat? 
Morning, ladies. How you doin ´ this morning? 
What ´ s goin ´ on, bro? 
Get away from me! 
Dude, according to these new rules... how many points do I get if I do that chick over there? 
The fat one? 
Six. 
No, bro, I did her last week and you only gave me five. And she ´ s not fat. 
Yeah, but I figure if he ´ s got the balls to go in after you, you dirty shit... I ´ m giving him an extra point. 
- Hey, guys. 
- Oh, Jesse, that Tracy girl. 
You gotta get all over that girl, man. 
Serious, bro. 
- She ´ s on my list. 
- She ´ s definitely fine. 
She got an ass stamped B.P., baby! 
Bulldog property. 
Can you develop these at work for me? 
- Total coyote date. 
- That ´ s harsh, bro. 
It ´ s the truth. 
- What ´ s a coyote date? 
- You don ´ t know? 
That ´ s when you wake up in the morning, some ugly chick sleeping on your arm... and you ´ d rather gnaw it off than have to wake her up. 
God, woman, you come prepared. 
Tell me who the special someone is. 
All will be revealed in due time. 
"" Romeo and Juliet,"" a tale... of star-crossed lovers, pulled apart by their families, society... and, some might say, by fate. 
Why is it that we are so moved by love that ends with separation? 
What say? 
Anyone. 
Anyone! 
I don ´ t know that I believe in it. 
Believe in what? 
Love. 
Well, then you ´ ve got bigger problems than passing this class. 
- Who would love her? 
- Yes, Arnold. 
"" Love is 15 seconds of squishing noises."" 
Unquote. 
Johnny Rotten. Know what I ´ m saying? 
Dork. 
Kill that kid. 
Do you think all love stories are tragedies? 
Unless they die at the same time... all lovers are eventually separated by death, right? 
Then"" Romeo and Juliet"" isn ´ t a tragedy. 
They could only be together in death. 
Yes! 
Very good! 
A foul cynic, most cliche. 
- A true romantic. 
How refreshing! 
- Yeah. 
Shut up. 
Oh, hello there. 
Hey, girls, what ´ s happenin ´? 
Move out. 
Thank you. 
Mark Bing wanted me to invite you to his party Friday night. 
- ls Jesse going with anyone? 
- l don ´ t think so. 
Could you please refrain from shooting my ass? 
Lisa. 
Did you see that? 
Oh, my God! 
Let ´ s go. 
Stay back, please. 
Let ´ s stay back. 
You better come with me. 
A girl just killed herself in the lot. 
Stay here. 
Best blood. 
Oh, my God. 
Rachel, come on, back away. 
Attention all students. 
Report to your homeroom classes. 
Oh, man. 
Whose car is this? 
She was really happy this morning. 
I don ´ t understand why she- - lt ´ s okay. 
Let it out. 
No. 
I don ´ t cry. 
Miss Snell, please report to the principal ´ s office. 
Miss Snell, please come to the principal ´ s office. 
I have to go. 
Rachel, stay here, okay? 
I ´ ll be back as soon as I can. 
One of our students died today. 
We will observe at exactly 1 : 00 p.m. a moment of silence. 
- Lisa Parker may be gone. 
- Hand me the score book. 
But she will not be forgotten by her friends. 
She will not be forgotten by her fellow students. 
She will not be forgotten by her teachers... or by her school. 
Her parents are going to want all this. 
Oh, my. 
That girl Lisa, right? 
Yeah. 
I was supposed to have lunch with her today. 
Yeah? 
You guys thought she was shit, right? 
Mark. 
Don ´ t look at me like this. You guys said it. You thought she was shit. 
What did you do? 
Nothing. I didn ´ t do anything. 
It ´ s just Lisa was acting all happy, you know, like we were going steady. 
And I had to break the news to her that she was just a pump. 
You know, a nut. 
She didn ´ t mean anything to me. 
I guess she couldn ´ t handle it. 
is that your brilliant attempt to fix it? 
That ´ s good. 
You need all the points you can get. 
I don ´ t know why you ´ re erasing them. 
That ´ s cold, man. 
On Friday we have the Kings University scout coming to the game. 
If all this gets out- - Sex and suicide. 
Come on, man. 
Catholic schools frown on that shit. 
If I don ´ t get into a good school, my dad ´ s gonna kill me. 
But nobody ´ s gonna find out about this. 
Lisa took a picture of us last night. 
What if her parents ask questions? 
That ´ s a problem. 
Oh, shit. 
All right, I ´ ll handle it. I ´ ll take care of it. 
How? 
Relax, man. 
Come on. 
Come on. 
- Sorry. Didn ´ t mean to scare you. 
- lt ´ s all right. 
You ´ re Rachel, right? 
Yeah. Yeah. 
I ´ m Jesse. 
English? 
Right. 
The true romantic? 
- Yeah. 
- Rachel, listen. 
That Lisa girl? 
She had these pictures that have what you might call sentimental value. 
I figured 20 bucks ought to cover it. 
What do you want, 30? 
They ´ re not your pictures. 
It ´ s not like she ´ s gonna be pickin ´ them anytime soon, is it? 
Cut it out, man. 
All right, Rachel, I ´ ll tell you what. 
How ´ bout I swing by when you get off work? 
I ´ ll take you out for a cruise. 
Come on. I don ´ t bite. 
Unless you want me to. 
I don ´ t think so. 
Why not? 
Because I ´ m a dyke. 
That ´ s funny. 
- Don ´ t laugh, man. 
- Just drive. 
How you doin ´ tonight? 
"" For a moment, I thought someone was actually seeing me... but it was all a lie. 
Eric lied when he said I was special, and I guess I was lying to myself. 
I believed him."" 
Rachel, is there anything in there that strikes a chord for you? 
Do you know what Lisa was referring to? 
Yesterday, she- - 
She told me she lost her virginity. 
Do you know this boy? 
Eric Stark. 
He ´ s on the team. 
Can I talk to you for a second? 
Excuse us, Rachel. 
Robbie, I had a freshman girl crying in the hallway last week. 
Five more have been in my office this semester. 
I couldn ´ t get anything out of them, but their friends told me... that football players slept with them then dumped them. 
There ´ s nothing illegal about breaking a girl ´ s heart. 
Eric is 18. 
Lisa was 16. That ´ s statutory rape. 
That ´ s a stretch. 
Let ´ s make it before someone else ´ s daughter jumps off a building. 
Listen. 
Are you sure you ´ re still not trying to save a girl that died 20 years ago? 
Help me! 
Plug it up! Plug it up! 
Okay. I ´ ll look into it. 
That was great. 
Yeah. 
The Minute Man! 
Do it, baby! Do it again. 
Gimme the book. 
That ´ s in the book. 
Panties. 
Oh, my- - 
He ´ s going back in for double time? 
I don ´ t feel good. I ´ m gonna be sick. 
- He ´ s gonna puke! 
- Not in my car. 
You know, Mark invited me to his party on Friday. 
What are you thinking about? 
Nobody. 
I asked what, not who. 
It ´ s nothing. 
Doesn ´ t it bother you that some girl offed herself yesterday? 
- Why? 
She wasn ´ t anybody. 
- What? 
I mean, I didn ´ t know her. 
You know, I still don ´ t have a date for Mark ´ s party. 
Hint, hint. 
Shit! 
Stop. 
Rachel, stop this. 
Hey, get back here. 
That rotten dog. 
Hey, your dumb dog got out. 
Walter! 
Stay! 
Stop! 
Walter! 
My God! 
Stop! 
Help! 
Please stop! 
Stop! 
Stop! 
Rachel? 
- Please. 
- What happened? 
Please help me. 
Are you gonna be all right? 
Sorry. 
For what? 
For making you come out here all this way. 
Don ´ t worry about it. 
And what about my windshield? 
How bizarre was that? 
I ´ m sorry about your car. 
It wasn ´ t your fault. 
It was probably a rock or something. 
Walter ´ s banged up pretty bad. 
Has broken ribs. 
He tore an artery in his front leg. 
He ´ s lost quite a bit of blood. 
His pressure ´ s stabilized. 
He ´ s gonna make it. 
- Can I see him? 
- Come back tomorrow. 
Any time after 8 : 00. 
Don ´ t worry. lt ´ s because you look like a mass murderer. 
What ´ s up with the music here? 
Don ´ t they have anything good, like some Garbage? 
- You like Garbage? 
- Yeah. Shirley Manson, she rocks. 
Lisa loved her. 
You two were really close, huh? 
I ´ m really sorry. 
Sometimes... I ´ d see someone from behind... and I ´ d know... I ´ d just know it was Lisa. 
And she ´ d turn around, and it wasn ´ t. 
But sometimes it was. 
And now... whenever I see someone who looks like her, and she turns around... it won ´ t be. 
Ever. 
It ´ s gettin ´ pretty late. 
- Can I give you a ride home? 
- No, I can walk. 
Yeah, right. 
I can hitch. 
Don ´ t worry about it. 
Then you can go hitch. 
Or I could just... wait for my limo. 
Yeah, you could do that. 
Just wait for your limo. 
Come on. 
All right, I guess I ´ ll see you in school tomorrow. 
Sure. 
You ´ ll let me know how Walter ´ s doing? 
Yeah. 
And thank you... for everything. 
Well, good night. 
Good night. 
- lt ´ s the dry weather. 
- An acrylic sweater. 
I shook her hand. 
Thank you for your support. 
I ´ d like your vote. 
Stupid. 
Lisa! 
Don ´ t! 
Don ´ t jump! 
Last night, I took a look at your file. 
Your mom is at Arkham for schizophrenia? 
How ´ s she doing? 
She ´ s gonna be fine. 
I had a really traumatic experience in high school. 
I tried to help someone, and it backfired horribly. 
No, stop! 
I spent some time at Arkham... as a patient. 
Does that shock you? 
I guess. I mean, you seem pretty normal to me. 
Yeah, well, I try. 
Do you visit your mom often? 
is that scary for you? 
What do you mean? 
It ´ s perfectly normal to be afraid of turning out like your parents. 
Come on. 
I know I ´ m ten times more likely to get it than most people. 
I didn ´ t mean to patronize you. 
So, is that scary for you? 
Rachel... in a way you ´ ve lost your mother... and now you ´ ve lost a friend. 
Losing people close to you can be... very painful and lonely. 
- lf you want to talk- - 
I ´ m sorry. 
I must ´ ve knocked it. 
I didn ´ t see you knock it. 
I know. 
I know what you did to her. 
As we can see from last year ´ s film... the Carlin Devils play tough, smash-mouth football. 
Here we see Mr. Bing- l thought you got the pictures. 
- Just relax, all right? Nobody knows but us. I ´ m sure they ´ re at the Photo Mat. I ´ ll get them. 
It takes an hour to develop film. 
Come on, man. 
Mr. Bing, on your feet. 
- Turn around and drop trou. 
- What? 
You heard. Drop trou, shorts and all. 
Now, son! 
If you wanna stay a starter on this team. 
You undress like a girl. 
After that half-assed block... I wanted to check to see if maybe you had a tampon string between your legs. 
Sit. 
All right, girls, come this Friday it ´ s gonna be kill or be killed. 
Let ´ s go! 
- Yeah, Bing! 
- You ready for the game Friday? 
You ´ re saying you ´ ve never seen, met or talked to Lisa Parker at all? 
No, sir, never. 
Who ´ s this you ´ re hanging on to? 
Salvation Army alert. 
Look who Jess is talking to. 
She ´ s such a bottom-feeder. 
You working tonight? 
No. 
You wanna meet me at the diner? 
- Yeah? 
- Yeah. 
Cool. 
See you there. 
So, what did he want? 
He asked me out. 
- And what ´ d you say? 
- l said,"" Okay. lt ´ s your funeral."" 
Well, okay, pardon me. 
But is hanging out with jock-boy such a hot idea? 
I just heard that he ´ s dating Tracy Campbell, you know. 
And she- - 
Right now she ´ s giving you the look of a thousand deaths. 
She ´ s beautiful. 
Yeah, duh! 
Coach says I ´ m starting this week. 
What happened in there? 
Kelton, with the frickin ´ sheriff ´ s badge he pulled out of a cereal box. 
Somebody told him I did Lisa, and I ´ m suspended. My dad ´ s gonna kill me. 
- What about the game? 
- Who cares? Kelton nailed me with a picture of Lisa and I, started talking statutory rape. 
Now I face the D.A. on Thursday. 
Relax. lt ´ s bullshit, all right? 
Your dad ´ s gonna kick your ass, but he ´ s a lawyer, and he ´ ll kill that shit dead. 
I ´ ll miss the game of the year. 
Football scouts are gonna be there... and I ´ m gonna be sitting on the bench with my thumb up my ass. 
And that bitch Rachel. 
You know she ´ ll be talking all kinds of shit to anyone who wants to listen. 
The best defense is a good offence. 
- What ´ s that supposed to mean? 
- Get in. 
We ´ re gonna do damage control. 
Get it together. 
He ´ s just a guy. 
You are gonna be late. 
Boyd? 
Emilyn? 
Forget your keys? 
Let ´ s take the front. 
Stop it! 
Stop! 
Stop! 
Stop! 
Rachel. 
- Hello. 
- What ´ s your favorite scary movie? 
Rachel? 
What? 
Are you naked? 
Who is this? 
Or are you wearing a little red towel? 
It ´ s playtime. 
Who the fuck is this? 
Why don ´ t l come in and show you, you fuckin ´ dyke? 
What do you want? 
Who is this? 
Don ´ t you recognize the voice? 
Who does it sound like? 
I ´ m calling the police. 
Come on out here, Rachel. 
- What are you doing? 
- Fuck her over like she ´ s fuckin ´ me. 
No way. 
What the fuck are you doin ´? 
I have an emergency. 
I ´ m at 3366 Broad Street. 
- lt ´ s the parents! 
- Let ´ s go. Let ´ s get out of here. 
Yeah, I ´ m still here. 
- lf she touches you one more time- - 
- You never liked her. 
Everything ´ s okay now. 
What ´ s this? 
Really. 
Thanks. 
Look at the window. 
What the hell happened here? 
How should I know? 
Ah, Jesus! 
Don ´ t go tellin ´ no stories about my boy Eric. 
Why do the innocent always get hit in a drive-by? 
What happened to you last night? 
I waited up for you. 
- Why don ´ t you tell me what happened? 
- What are you talking about? 
I waited in the cafe for over an hour. 
I ´ ll tell you what happened. 
Okay, what is wrong with this picture? 
What does he see in her? 
Come on, Trace. 
You ´ re caviar, she ´ s Cheez Whiz. 
He ´ ll come around. He ´ s letting little Jesse do the thinking for big Jesse. 
I just don ´ t want any part of this, okay? 
Look, let me talk to Mark. 
I ´ ll work this out. 
They were probably drunk and just being stupid. 
No, don ´ t. 
You know what? Maybe all of this isn ´ t such a good idea. 
All of what? 
Guys like you are supposed to date girls like Tracy, okay? 
That ´ s what this is about? 
No. Hold on. 
Her? Let me take you out for a date. 
A nice mellow one. 
I ´ m not going anywhere until you say yes. 
See? 
I mean it. I ´ m telling you. 
Just say yes. 
What was that? 
All right. 
Yes. 
Rachel, I need to talk to you. 
We need to talk. 
- What ´ s the matter? 
- Did you go by Rachel ´ s? 
Yeah. We were just sending her a little message. 
Give it to me next time. 
I ´ ll make sure she gets it. 
What are you gettin ´ all bent for? 
This girl ´ s just a skank. - You don ´ t even know her. 
- You do? 
What do you know about her? 
She ´ s a nice girl. 
She doesn ´ t deserve to be treated like that. 
- Who are you to send her a message? 
- Who am I? I ´ m a friend who gives a shit that my boy ´ s goin ´ down for rape. 
That ´ s who. I ´ m gonna do anything I gotta do to keep her from fuckin ´ talkin ´. 
Eric ´ s a big boy. 
He made his own decisions. Let him live with them. 
You got say anything else to say to her, deal with me. 
- Deal with you? 
- Deal with me. 
No. You ´ re gonna have to deal with me. 
What is wrong with you, Jesse? 
This is us, man! 
We ´ re all friends here. 
No, we just grew up together. 
This is just a test that will let me know how to help you better. 
You ´ re wasting your time. 
Just answer the statements true or false, okay? 
"" There ´ s a man inside the television who tells me what to do."" 
False? I don ´ t see the point. 
"" Sometimes my thoughts assume the form of a giant insect."" 
- This doesn ´ t make any sense. 
- Answer true or false. 
Again."" Sometimes my thoughts assume the form of a giant insect."" 
False. 
"" lf you want to play the piano well, you have to practice."" 
True. 
"" Large furry animals crawl on my face every night while I sleep."" 
True. 
I have a dog. 
"" Sometimes I can move things with my mind."" 
- You can ´ t make me do this. 
- Honey, sit down. 
I ´ m trying to help. 
- You ´ re not my mother, you know. 
- l ´ m trying to be your friend. Let go of me! 
They ´ re all gonna laugh at you! 
Selling used cars is not what I want. 
Unless I nail that football scholarship, that ´ s what I get. 
I can ´ t believe I ´ m telling you this. 
I never told anybody this before in my life. 
It must be nice not having to be like everybody else. 
It ´ s not so great. 
I mean... sometimes I wish I could just be one of the shiny, happy people. 
Does that surprise you? 
Yeah. 
Everything about you surprises me. 
I knew this guy once. 
He did this thing. 
He could suck a strand of spaghetti... up his mouth and right out of his nose. 
Brain flossing? 
He called it a talent. 
I bet you ´ re wondering where l ´ m going with this, right? 
Well- - 
You really have a talent. 
You ´ ve got football. 
It ´ ll get you out of this place. 
After that, you can do what you want. 
Make your own path. 
Write your own book. 
- Think so? 
- Word. Word? 
Word. 
You wanna come with me? 
What? 
Your brake. It ´ s poking me right in the back. 
You wanna- - 
I really don ´ t know how to say this. 
What? 
I ´ ve never- - 
Yeah. 
- And I want it to be special. 
- Yeah. 
Like, you come to my door with flowers in your hand. 
Oh, well, okay. 
What kind of flowers do you like? 
Daisies. 
Okay. I ´ ll have to remember that. 
I don ´ t know! 
I don ´ t know! 
Mrs. Lang, I need to ask you a few questions about Rachel. 
Who is- - 
Who is her father? 
It isn ´ t important. 
- l knew you ´ d come back. 
- l ´ m afraid we don ´ t know each other. 
We can still get married. 
I ´ ll marry you. - l need to know who he is. 
- l ´ m sorry, that ´ s private. 
The hell with them! 
What do they know? 
Cut it out! 
She ´ s not Terry. 
Kindly go away. 
Poor thing. He ´ s never had a visitor. Wants to share everybody else ´ s. 
Mrs. Lang, it ´ s very important... that you tell me who Rachel ´ s father is. 
I don ´ t see how that ´ s any of your business. 
I ´ m trying to help Rachel. 
She seems troubled, and I ´ m very worried about her. 
You ´ re worried? Are you very worried? 
I am, yes. 
You don ´ t have any children, do you, miss? 
No, I don ´ t. 
Then you don ´ t know. You will never know how terrifying children can be. 
Mrs. Lang, I know this is a really strange question... but when Rachel was growing up... did you ever see objects move by themselves? 
And did the doctors convince you it was all your imagination? 
The Lord is with thee. 
No. I was crazy then. 
I thought she was possessed. 
I thought the devil was inside her. 
Mrs. Lang, Rachel needs help. 
She may have a disease, a genetic disorder. 
I believe her father may have passed it on to her. 
Disease? 
Could I have it? Did I give it to her? 
- No. - How do you know? 
Because the male is the carrier. 
Mrs. Lang, you must tell me his name. 
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners... now and at the hour of our death, amen. 
I did tell Rachel once how we met. 
He said it was love at first sight. 
I ´ ll tell you, but don ´ t you dare hurt my daughter. 
I never told her ´ cause people around here... aren ´ t so fond of Carrie White ´ cause of what she did. 
See, he was her daddy, too. 
His name was Ralph. 
Ralph White. 
Rachel? 
I need you to come with me. 
The night of the prom... 73 people died. 
A few of us survived... but we ´ ve never talked about that night. 
That ´ s why I ended up at Arkham, if you wondered. 
I witnessed something I can ´ t even begin to tell you about. 
But look around. See for yourself. 
This was the original high school. 
I wish they ´ d tear this place down. 
It ´ s like some twisted memorial to that night. 
I haven ´ t been here in over 20 years. 
Happy homecoming. 
You ´ ve heard of Carrie White, haven ´ t you? 
Supposedly she set the fire... as some type of revenge-suicide thing. 
Elvis was her date, and they escaped in a UFO. 
I know what happened to that snow dome on my desk. 
It fell. 
We both know. 
Rachel, is Jesse Ryan pressuring you- - 
Excuse me. That ´ s none of your business. 
I know everything there is to know about Carrie White. 
She did this. 
It began with something like you did with the snow dome... and then it got out of control. 
- l ´ m leaving. 
- lt ´ s a genetic recessive trait. 
- What are you saying I have? 
I ´ m saying you ´ re not crazy, and it ´ s not the devil. 
It ´ s a trait you ´ ve inherited. 
Telekinesis : the ability to move objects with your mind. 
For years, I didn ´ t believe it existed. 
But there are places that study it. 
There ´ s a lab at Princeton. 
I can take you there. 
With all respect, lady... you are seriously bat shit. 
I ´ m walking back to the real world now. 
You mother told me your father is Carrie ´ s father. 
No, my father ´ s name was Bill Kirk. 
- He left when I was three months old. 
- lt ´ s a lie. My mother wouldn ´ t lie to me. 
Believe me, you need help. 
Like what? Like they helped you? 
I can help you to get it under control. 
I don ´ t want or need your help. 
You ´ re not really thinking of pressing charges against my son? 
Oh, we ´ re doing more than thinking. 
Look, Eric ´ s a good kid. 
He may be guilty of some youthful transgressions- - 
Youthful transgressions? 
A girl killed herself, Lou. 
Hello, Jay. 
Sit. Everybody sit. 
I ´ m just listening in. 
Okay, then. 
Cards on the table. 
My boy isn ´ t going down alone. 
Go on. 
Mark Bing, Jesse Ryan, Brad Winters and Chuck Potter. 
We ´ re talking about the most prominent families in this town. 
Maybe they ´ ve all slept with underage girls. 
Who can tell? And, yes, maybe they made a game of it. 
And perhaps Eric can even get proof of that. 
I agree it would be awful, but I don ´ t think it ´ s criminal. 
Now, there will be scouts at the game on Friday. 
Eric takes a fall, maybe they all will. 
You wanna be responsible for ruining these boys ´ lives? 
That sums it up. 
Karen, what we have here is an issue with intent. 
- Blue-sheet it. 
- Oh, but Jay- - What you don ´ t have is evidence enough to tarnish this boy ´ s reputation. 
It ´ s not about evidence, is it? It ´ s about elections, right? 
That is it, Robbie. 
That is all. Lou, thanks for coming by. 
I ´ ll walk you out. 
- Appreciate it. - l know what you ´ re going through. 
- l hope we see you at the game. 
- Hey, is this seat taken? 
- What ´ s goin ´ on? 
- Just studying. 
You gonna come to the game Friday? 
I don ´ t really do football. 
It ´ s the season opener. 
There ´ s gonna be some scouts there. 
I need you, for luck. 
If he ´ s gonna do it, you know, be seen talking in public with someone... he should show some respect. 
I mean, he should show me the respect at least to be seen with someone pretty. 
Someone cool, someone who counts. 
You know, someone. 
But instead, it ´ s her. 
I just feel totally- - 
Disrespected. 
Yeah. 
Honey, you ´ re being seriously dissed. 
Man, I just wish there was something I could do to make him come to his senses. 
Mark ´ s got his wheels turning. 
What? 
Come on. Good lift. 
One more. 
Push it out, man. Come on, push it. 
Nice. 
Look, man, I ´ m sorry. 
I guess I overreacted. 
- Don ´ t fuck with me. 
You know, we ´ ve been friends since we were both dumping ´ our drawers, dude. 
I thought we ´ d be best friends forever. 
Never figured some girl would come in the way of that. 
Look, I know I ´ m scum. 
I ´ m prepared to admit that. 
I ´ m lower than scum. 
I ´ m smegma. I ´ m butt lint. 
- Keep going. 
- l ´ m a prick. I ´ m an asshole. 
- Asshole, yeah. - lt ´ s that good. 
I ´ m sorry, man. 
I ´ m not the one you should be apologizing to. 
I know. 
Karen, watch my counter, please. 
Can I help you? 
Just- - Just looking. 
Thanks. 
Mrs. Porter, this is a friend of mine from school. 
I thought she was gonna frisk me. 
She does step class with my mom. 
So, what are you shopping for? 
Oh, nothing. Just looking. 
is it perhaps something to wear on a date? 
Perhaps with a certain jock hunk we all know? 
You know, Tracy isn ´ t universally loved. 
There ´ s a shocker. 
Exhibit A : She tried to steal Brad from me. 
She ´ s a"" Melrose Place"" superbitch. 
You have got great lips. 
Really. Look. This shade will look very kissable and soft. 
Come here. 
Trust me, okay? 
Hold still. 
So, are you going to the game? 
Just blink once for yes. 
Great, ´ cause there ´ s this big party afterwards, and I hope you can go. 
I don ´ t think so. 
Oh, come on. You really should. 
I mean, for Jesse. 
I know it ´ d mean a lot to him if we all got along. 
Yeah. So you ´ ll go? 
Great! 
See? 
Can I ring that up for you? 
Sure. 
How much is it? 
Oh, um, maybe next time. 
Thanks, Mrs. Porter. 
I kleptoed it for you. 
Hey, over here! 
Figured out how to make it up to you and Rachel. 
The summerhouse, bro. 
My parents aren ´ t gonna be there. 
I figured you wanted to get away from us idiots for a little while. 
Have a nice, romantic time. 
All right? 
But you ´ re gonna bring her by my party. 
So I can apologize to her, all right? 
Then we can all be one big, happy family again. 
All right? 
Have a good time, man. 
- You look great. 
- Thanks. 
I really like your hair. 
Oh, you can just, you know, throw those in the back or something. 
I know Mark can be a jerk sometimes, but, you know, he ´ s trying. 
He ´ s got a party Friday, and he invited us. 
- We won ´ t go if you don ´ t want to. 
- No, let ´ s go. 
Really? 
What ´ s wrong? 
I ´ m just a little scared. 
Don ´ t be scared. 
I know. I just feel kind of strange. 
Look, we don ´ t have to do this tonight. 
Whenever you ´ re ready. 
God, I must be crazy. 
Actually, you ´ re about the sanest person I know. 
You ´ re sane. 
I love you. 
You ´ re grounded, for a week! 
- But I ´ ve gotta go to the game- - 
- You wanna make it two? 
You stay in this room. 
Am I clear? 
Yes, sir. 
Come on! Shave it off! 
Hey, you ´ re next. 
Get in the chair. 
- Come on! 
- Come on, bro! 
- Come on! 
- Come on, man! 
Oh, you ´ re gonna ruin the whole effect, bro! 
Oh, Jess, where ´ s your sac? 
Come on! 
You have to tell her who her father is. - Why? 
- Because she ´ ll believe it from you. 
Rachel needs to seek treatment before it ´ s too late. 
Too late for what? 
Rachel ´ s best friend committed suicide... and I ´ m afraid Rachel may... harm herself or others. 
And you want to take me out there? 
Yes. 
He saw me! 
Go get ´ em, baby! 
Good afternoon, and welcome to today ´ s matchup... between your Bates Bulldogs and the Carlin Devils. 
This is the first game for both teams... as the Bulldogs seek their seventh consecutive championship. 
However, there is a history of bad blood between these two teams... as the Devils have consistently been a thorn in the Bulldogs ´ side. 
Well, let ´ s hope the Dawgs can pull that thorn out once and for all... as the special teams get set for the opening kickoff. 
Number 42 of the Bulldogs, Chuck Potter, receiving the kick. 
Oh, my! 
He ´ s popped. 
Could I have my purse, please? 
Just about five minutes to go now in the second quarter. 
Go, Jesse! 
A vicious hit by Stark. Johnson, number 45, isn ´ t getting up. 
- What the hell kind of call was that? 
- And it looks like number 33, Stark... is being ejected for a flagrant personal foul. 
What the hell is he fuckin ´ doing? 
- That was not a flagrant foul! 
- Thirty-three has been disqualified. 
Oh, why don ´ t l just take every starter out for you, all right? 
Touchdown, Devils! 
The Bulldogs are trailing in the second half as they receive the Devils ´ punt. 
Number 42, Chuck Potter, takes the kick again for the Dawgs. 
And there he goes... cutting across the field, racing down the sideline! 
Fourth quarter action. Here ´ s the snap. 
A quick pass to Jesse Ryan, and, oooh, he was hit hard. 
What a pop. 
He is down. 
He is not getting up right away. 
Wait a minute. I see- - l see movement. 
Yes, he ´ s finally moving now. He ´ s up. 
Shaking it off. And there he goes. 
Everything ´ s so different, so very different. 
Things change. 
There ´ s Mr. Bellows. 
Hello, George! 
He always had an eye for me, that one. 
- Where? 
- Right there. 
Hello, George. 
Devils suck! 
Well, it ´ s pretty much do or die time now, folks. 
The Dawgs down by four with only 12 seconds left on the clock. 
Boy, it ´ s been a struggle all day for these Dawgs... trying to move the ball against the very stingy Devils defense. 
I think it ´ s safe to say this is not how the Dawgs wanted it to come out today. 
They ´ ve had a very tough time on defense. 
- They ´ re not moving the ball as usual. 
- Ryan, get up here. Come on. 
All right, son, trips right, crazy eight. 
Let ´ s go. 
They ´ re really taking their time here. Probably their last play of the game. 
Trips right, crazy eight. 
Go, Bulldogs! 
Hey, come back here! 
Last chance. We ´ ll look for a Hail Mary. We ´ ve got Jesse Ryan set wide. 
Bulldogs set. There ´ s the snap. 
Miller drops back. 
A long bomb down towards the corner. 
Ryan is there. He ´ s under it. He jumps. 
He ´ s got it! 
Complete! 
Touchdown, Bulldogs! 
Touchdown! 
The Bulldogs win it! 
College scout ´ s here. 
He wants to talk to you. 
Could you tell Rachel to wait for me? 
I ´ m gonna be a few minutes. 
No problem. And, hey, good luck. 
Thanks. 
Jesse ´ s gonna be a while. 
He ´ s talking with a scout. 
- He said to go ahead to the party. 
- You hear that, Rachel? 
Jesse ´ s talking to a scout. 
Isn ´ t that great? 
- Yeah, that ´ s great. 
- All right. 
I ´ m goin ´ with the guys. 
See you there. 
Come on. 
I ´ ll give you a ride to Mike ´ s. 
- Thanks. 
- Deborah! 
Dress. 
Dress time. 
- Try this. 
- Thanks. 
Mascara. Mascara! 
Sorry. 
Done. 
How do I look? 
- You look beautiful. 
- Thank you. 
- You look good, Monica. - Thank you. 
You look pretty, too. 
- You look really pretty. 
- You need lipstick. 
Yo, check it out. 
Goddamn it! 
Whoa, that sucks. 
They even slashed my tires. 
It ´ s further proof the Devils are just a bunch of pigs, huh? 
- Are you looking for Rachel? 
- Yeah. 
Well, she ´ s at Mark ´ s. 
You want a ride over there? 
I just have to stop by my place real quick. 
- Tommy, have you seen Rachel Lang? 
- Who? 
- Rachel Lang. 
Was she at the game? 
- Oh, yeah. With the tattoo. 
I saw her leave with Monica Jones. 
I guess they went to Mark Bing ´ s party. 
Rachel with Monica? 
Just go away! 
Todd, get off my butt! 
Stop. 
Whoa, bro, what are you doing? 
You bust something in this house, heads are seriously gonna roll. 
Yes! 
Rachel, yo. 
You could get me into this party, right? 
Hey, Arnie, wait right here. 
We ´ ll come back for you. 
- See, I told you. 
- ln a couple of years. 
How come she gets to go in, then? 
- She ´ s one of us. 
- l ´ ll try and get you in, Arnie. 
Fuck that. 
Come on, guys, let ´ s do some serious doughnuts now. 
Come on. 
Hit it! 
So, then the scout said, and I quote... 
"" l love your aggressive play. 
You have that killer instinct."" 
That ´ s great, buddy. For you, that is great. 
- There she is. 
You better disappear. 
- No problem. 
Swank. 
Relax. 
They just need to get to know you for who you really are. 
- How about a drink? 
- Right on. 
What can I get you beautiful ladies to drink? 
Some margaritas would be nice. 
- B-Rad. 
- Yo! 
- Margaritas. 
- Comin ´! 
- Thanks. 
- l ´ m glad you could make it. 
Look, I ´ m sorry about the other night at your house. 
It was just a bunch of guys being guys. I ´ m sorry. 
Jesse told us to cool it and explain everything. 
So, no hard feelings? Peace? 
Well, as long as you pour me a drink, all right. 
Sho ´. 
- Thanks. 
- To new friends, then? 
- Drink to that. 
- Okay. 
Tracy, I appreciate the ride, but, uh, let ´ s go. 
Just a minute. I ´ m trying to figure out what to wear. 
Of course. 
Hey, what do you think of this? 
- Looks good. 
- Really? 
Well, I don ´ t know. 
I think it might be a bit much. 
Don ´ t you? 
We ´ re gonna be late. 
Pretty soon she won ´ t care if you ´ re late. 
What ´ s that? 
Well, if she cares about you, she won ´ t mind if you ´ re late. 
- Come on, wench, let ´ s dance. 
- Don ´ t you"" wench"" me. 
Come on, Rachel, let ´ s dance. 
I think I ´ d rather wait for Jesse. 
- He ´ d want you to have fun. 
- Come on, have some fun. 
Yeah, come on, Rach. 
I got you, babe. Come on. 
Go, Rachel! 
Hey, Mark, I got a little present for you, right here. 
Hey, Mark, you like the game footage, huh? 
I love the footage. Yes, I do. 
Are you talking about today ´ s game? 
No, I ´ m talking about the other game. 
What other game? 
- The game that you ´ re in. 
My turn. 
- Yeah? 
- The game that you played, Rachel. 
- That ´ s right. 
What was the score? 
Chuckie, grab that score book. 
I wanna see it. 
- Want to see it now? All right. 
- Come here, baby. 
I wanna show you how you helped Jesse win the game. 
Two-twenty-four! Hut, hut, hut, hut! 
Rachel, catch! 
Yeah, baby! 
Yeah! 
Hold it! 
I gotta get my camera for this. 
- Read off the scores. - Whoa. 
Hold on. 
Come on, Rachel. 
Give it to us. 
Read the scores! 
Let ´ s start with Eric ´ s scores... ´ cause it ´ s gonna be so sad. Come on. Please. 
Start with poor Eric. 
What ´ s the matter, Rach? 
is there someone there that you recognize? 
Someone you know? Huh? 
Lisa. 
Forgot about Lisa. 
Come on down! 
That ´ s our brother! 
The D.A. kissed his butt! 
- We were just talking about Lisa. 
- Oh, Lisa. 
How was she? 
Well, to be honest, I just about split her in two. 
- How many points was she? 
- She was worth four points. 
But I think we should deduct those since she offed herself. 
Wait. 
Think of how many points he ´ d have got if he ´ d done her after she was dead. 
- A bit cold, huh? 
- Chuck, come on! 
Rach, baby, read that. Open it up to Jesse ´ s page. 
I want you to see how many points... 
Jesse got for you. 
Oh, well, I think that ´ ll be about a two-four-six-eight! 
Who do we appreciate? 
More than that, ´ cause remember, Rach, you said you were a dyke... so he got extra points for the conversion. 
Oh, the conversion! 
Two points! 
Not two. 
Thirty! 
Thirty! 
You gave her thirty? 
She should get extra points, being that she ´ s so skanky. 
Look at that. 
Look at it. 
See, we didn ´ t think Jesse could do it. 
- So he offered to get us proof. 
- How do you like Jesse ´ s big play? 
Lookie, lookie here, Rachel. 
- They ´ re all gonna laugh at you! 
- Was it good for you? 
is that you? 
They ´ re all gonna laugh at you! 
Oh, come on, Rachel! 
Was it good, Rachel? 
Sucker! 
Hey, is that a zit on your ass? 
It is! 
It is a zit on her ass! 
No, that ´ s a mole. 
Holy shit. 
What? 
- Mark, what ´ s going on? 
- l have no idea. 
Out of my way! 
Brad, you bastard! 
- Get out of the way! 
Move it! 
- Shit! 
It won ´ t open! 
Holy shit, dude! 
It ´ s her doing it! 
Go! 
Somebody put me out! 
Help! 
Oh, God, help me! 
Oh, my God! 
Let me out! 
Man, we ´ re missing one killer party. 
- Where are the fuckin ´ keys? 
- Hurry! 
My stupid dad. 
He ´ s always hiding these friggin ´ keys! 
Hurry up! 
Come on! 
Tyler! 
Tyler, get up! 
- What the hell ´ s this? 
- lt ´ s a spear gun, idiot. 
- Give me that shit. 
- Hey, man, forget the flare gun. 
What are you gonna do with a flare gun? 
It ´ s all my fault. 
Let ´ s go! 
Get outta here! 
Oh, shit! 
Go on! 
Through the glass! 
Come on! 
Get up! 
- Pull the cord! 
- Where ´ s the fucking cord? 
Oh, shit. 
Momma? 
What ´ s wrong? 
What are you? 
You ´ re not my little girl. 
The devil ´ s in you! 
Momma, please! 
Momma, don ´ t leave me! 
Don ´ t leave me! 
I don ´ t have anyone. 
Please. 
Please, God... let me die. 
Please? 
Come on. She ´ s dead. 
They ´ re all dead. 
We have to get out of here. 
Let ´ s go. 
Oh, my God. 
Forget about that! Let ´ s go! 
- You used me. 
- l had no idea they were taping us! 
Liar! 
is that all I was to you? 
Thirty points? 
I would never do that to you. 
You have to trust me. 
- l would never hurt you. 
- Stop lying! 
I believed you. 
You know that? 
God, I believed you. 
Listen to me. 
I love you. I do. 
- You ´ re a liar! 
- No, I love you. 
I love you. 
Get out. 
Stay away from me. 
Please go. 
- l love you. 
- What? 
I love you. 
Hey, Walt. 
You ´ re gonna get us kicked out of here. 
Believe that! 
Ladies, we got picture. 
What about the alarm? 
Miles, what do you think I'm doing? 
Just cool out. 
We like to run a loose crew around here. 
You're the boss, Miles. 
It's like that? 
It's like that. 
I'm gonna go check on Tulley. 
Tulley, we cool down there? 
Yeah, we're cool, man. 
Good. 
Cool is good. 
Are you smoking? 
No. 
Negative. 
You're lying! 
I smell the menthol up here, man! 
What would your mama do if she knew you were smoking? 
Cut it out, man! 
Stay alert. 
You ready over here? 
Damn it! 
Eddie, why you gotta do that every time? 
It's good luck. 
It's bad luck if I land in it. Believe that. 
Don't fall in that shit. 
See you, Deke. 
Good luck, guys. 
How's the weather up there? 
Snowing. 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. 
You got a guard 20 feet from you. 
Ten feet. 
He's closing in fast. 
Around the corner. 
He turned around. 
Forget it. 
He's gone. 
So much for the easy part. 
Kit. 
- Shit! 
- Bam! 
I hate it when you do that. 
Eddie, check this out. 
This is a Brigger 3300. 
Toughest safe in the world. 
- What do you do? 
- Drill the lock. 
No, you gotta check to see if it's open. 
It's open! 
What? 
No, I'm messing with you. 
They would never do that. 
They would never do that. 
Glasses. 
- l'll see you back up top. 
- Right. 
Open sesame. 
Come on, Eddie. 
Got the rock? 
Miles is right behind me. 
What the hell you doing? 
Seventeen million four ways? 
I'm too greedy for that. 
No, just come on, man! 
Shit! 
Come here, gorgeous. 
Got the rock. 
Time to roll. 
Hurry! 
There's lots of activity here. 
Let's go! 
Shit! 
Freeze! 
Clear! 
Let's go! 
- Stay down! 
Don't move! 
- Let me see your hands! 
- Where's Eddie? 
- He went over already. 
- You have the rock? 
- What? 
You got the rock? 
- What you doing? 
- Give me the rock! 
You ain't got to do this! 
We're supposed to split this shit, man! 
Why you doing this? 
Shit! 
Miles, you're dead, you piece of shit! 
Damn! 
Good doggie! 
Good doggie! 
Kibbles' n Bits! 
Easy. 
Where's the nearest exit? 
Stay where you are! 
Turn around! 
I'm a carpenter! 
I was working late! 
See? 
That's the saw! 
See? 
I was working! 
You're under arrest. 
You have the right to remain silent. 
Anything you say can and will be used against you. 
If you can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you. 
Do you understand your rights? 
Yeah, I understand them. 
Ain't nothing but a free thing, baby! 
Free man. 
Believe that. 
One belt, one shoelace one wallet containing $ 22. 
One shoelace? 
You know how much them shoes cost? 
One shoelace? 
I came in here with two. 
You took my shoelace? 
Did you take my shoelace, man? 
You got two seconds to walk out that door. 
Sign out and leave my pen. 
I'm signing out. 
I got places to go, people to see. 
My lady, Janiece. 
Ass.... lt's like that. 
What you gonna do with one shoelace? 
Let me in on the secret. 
Floss your ass? 
Gotta go. 
Y'all stay up, man. 
Don't be mad because I gotta go. 
Come on, open this fence. Thanks. 
I'm out of here. 
Where them butt-naked hoes at? 
Do you know? 
Let me up out of here. 
I'm free! 
I'm free at last! 
Gotta go! 
Gotta go, gotta go! 
I'm out of here! 
Damn! 
What happened? 
Did you eat the whole time I was in there? 
When I left, you was like plickety-cow, plickety-pat. 
Now, you're like va-voom! 
Wait a minute. 
That's all right. 
I can adjust. 
It's the love that counts. 
I can adjust to a plus-size woman. 
Just more cushion for the pushin'! 
Janiece! 
Your sad-ass sack of bones is here. 
I apologize. 
You're her cousin! 
Can I buy you some cereal? 
It's okay, Shawna. 
There you are. 
Just hot! 
Baby, you are.... 
You look beautiful. 
You are beautiful. 
And that's not two years of prison talking. 
Baby, it must've been hard in there for you. 
All alone at night in your little cot. 
Tell me something, Miles. 
Did you think about me? 
Think about you all the time. 
Think about you right now. 
Then you should've thought about that before you robbed people! 
I never robbed you! 
I'm a rehabilitated man! 
Talk to me! 
I didn't come see you for two years. 
Wasn't that a sign? 
You couldn't stand to see your man like that. 
Man? 
You're not my man. 
You lie. 
You told me you were a banker. 
Bank robber. 
Yeah, see, sometime I stutter. 
But I'm getting that whole speech impediment thing- - 
You are a very smart man, but the entire time we spent together was one big lie. 
Look, Janiece. 
Listen to me, okay? 
I know I lied about some things, but I can change. 
I don't think so. 
Bye! 
Don't do me like this! 
Fifth and Grand? 
How you doing? 
is this really a police station? 
Of course. 
Hi. I have a delivery for Traffic. 
Sign by the" X." 
What have we got? 
Egg roll, orange chicken.... 
Hot pizza coming through. 
Hot pizza! 
Got to get the officers their pizza. 
They got to protect and serve. 
The police got to eat too! 
Let the officers eat, please. 
I'm the pizza man here to deliver the pizza. 
Thank you. 
Officers, I got your pizzas! 
" Third Floor : 
Robbery-Homicide." 
Yeah, please be careful. 
Pizza's very hot. 
Don't want nobody to get hurt. 
Just got here some pizza for you. 
Pizza for you. 
That's how we do it down at the pizza place. 
Watch it, watch it, watch it! 
Two time, bring it up! 
Don't drop the pizza! 
Pizza delivery for Robbery-Homicide. 
Robbery-Homicide? 
Why is it I don't see Robbery-Homicide with a pizza delivery in the log-in sheet? 
I'll tell you what. 
Why don't you leave that pizza with me? 
No, I'll tell you what. 
Last time I left a pizza here it magically disappeared. 
I mean, it's just like leaving candy around me. 
It's not gonna be all right. 
I'm gonna chomp it up. 
Two kinds of people get through that door : 
People wearing handcuffs. 
People wearing a badge. 
You don't have on either. 
Well, I don't have a badge or handcuffs, so.... 
Officer Carlson. 
- We wanna flip that card right over. 
- Sorry. Just got it. 
Excuse me, officer. 
The guys in Homicide ordered this pizza about an hour ago. 
I don't wanna leave them with Shamu over there. 
What do you want me to do? 
Take them! 
- I'm on duty. I can't do that. 
- Yes, you can! 
Please take that! 
Thank you very much! 
Break it down. 
Two time, left! 
One time! 
Break it down to the ground! 
Go here! 
Left leg! 
Bring it around! 
Walk! 
You hid a diamond in the police station? 
I didn't know it was a police station. 
Can you change the l.D. or not? 
Sure, but won't they be suspicious of a pizza man with a security clearance? 
I'm not going back as a pizza man. 
What are you going as? 
A cop. 
A cop? 
A new transfer. 
That's why I need that l.D. and a new file for detective. 
Why a detective? 
That's where the rock is. 
It's gonna be expensive. 
Uncle Lou, I thought we was like family. 
Yeah, well," like family" is not family. 
If you were family, you'd want it for free, right? 
Well, you ain't changed. 
I'll see you later. 
Get down! 
Put some clothes on! 
Get your butt-naked ass down! 
Get your butt-naked ass down! 
He's naked and he's stinking. 
Somebody get him some clothes. 
He's hiding a gun in his ass! 
Get on the ground. 
Do it now. 
Don't I know you? 
Freeze! 
Cuff him! 
Yeah, cuff his ass. 
I'm gonna cuff you like that. 
I'm the good cop. 
You act up, I'll turn into the bad one. 
Freeze! 
Get them up! 
Spread your legs now. 
I'm an officer of the law. 
Any sign of Deacon? 
Last I heard, he was pulling rip jobs in Carson. 
- l warned you about that guy. 
- That you did. 
He'll know you're out. 
This is purely cosmetic. 
It won't check out. 
Don't worry. I'll be out of there in an hour, max. 
Thanks. 
Good luck. 
Hey there, officer dog. 
I'm a detective. 
Sorry, sir. 
She's never done that. 
Must be the pastrami. 
Bitch! 
Are you going up? 
Up. 
Third floor. 
Appreciate it. 
What? 
What? 
The vehicle belonged to your friend, but you don't remember his name? 
Do you have a last name? 
Damn, these cuffs are tight, man! 
Miss Green, could you tell this man to loosen these cuffs? 
I can't feel my fingers, man. 
I'm serious. 
Please? 
- l know it. 
- Detective. 
Not so tight. 
Maybe I could loosen them up a bit. 
You got a great lawyer there. 
Top of the line. 
Here you go. 
He's in here! 
Jesus! 
How y'all doing? 
Not again, Carlson! 
The guy body-slammed me, sir. 
Maybe he likes you. 
He did what to you? 
Get him out of here! 
What were you thinking? 
Man, that's not smart! 
Get him out of here. 
What the hell happened up there? 
Up here? 
I caught him trying to escape. 
Who the hell are you? 
Malone. 
Just transferred. 
Right there. 
Yeah, check that out. 
Bam! 
- You know Malone? 
- No. 
Nobody told me about it. 
Guys.... 
Sorry, ma'am. 
Excuse me. 
Let me flush, please. 
I didn't know. 
You might not wanna go in there. 
You got some paperwork for me, Malone? 
We've been requesting a new detective for 8 months. 
Suddenly, you just turn up. 
I'll never understand the system. 
Burglary? 
Sixteen citations, mayor's commendation. 
You worked out of West Covina? 
Well, that's what it says right there. 
You look familiar, Malone. 
Have we met before? 
You wouldn't happen to be in a bowling league, would you? 
That's it. 
You're a bowler. 
I try. 
We could use a guy in Burglary. 
Right here. 
I thought I was gonna be assigned to a desk. 
Right up in here! 
Are you kidding me? 
A guy like you? 
No, you belong on the street. 
And also, listen. 
Carlson needs a partner with some experience. 
He just got promoted. 
Chief, I just got a call. 
Malone's gonna join us. 
Show him around. 
And let Malone do all the handcuffing, okay? 
I appreciate that, yeah. 
I'll review these. 
This is the bullpen here. 
That's Booking up there. 
The holding cells are down that way. 
You wanna see them? 
Seen one, seen them all. 
This is my desk here, sir. 
Nice desk. 
Thanks. 
Let's see.... 
Brass is on five. 
Robbery-Homicide on three. 
Over there, that's the tag and bag. 
- Through those doors, that's 1 0-1 7. 
- Roger. 
Show him the rest later. 
- Come on. 
- Where? 
We got a call. 
Burglary. 
It's ours. I'll take this. 
Outside? 
That's where all the crime is. 
I just got here, and that's not a good thing. 
I gotta do work in here so that I know what's going on out there. 
I might need backup, right? 
How long you been in Burglary? 
Me? 
All my life, man, all my life. 
I heard the chief say that you got 1 6 citations. 
That's incredible! Sixteen! 
That's what happens when your Uncle Lou writes your file. 
You can ride up front if you want. 
I knew that. 
You just gotta be real careful for the pedestrians coming out here. 
Walking around out here. 
Am I clear to the right? 
Am I clear? 
Have I got it? 
I just made detective. 
No kidding. 
I worked Traffic for three years. 
I got pretty good at it. 
You don't have to stop for the yellow. 
You could just drive right through. 
Sir, not if you'd seen some of the accidents I've seen. 
No thanks. 
Well, there's your green right there. 
Can I ask you a personal question? 
Yeah, sure. 
How many times did you take the test? 
What test? 
You know, the test for detective. 
That one! 
- One time. 
- Really? 
Aced it. 
Took it out. 
Took me five tries. 
I did well on the written part, but my performance reviews weren't so hot. 
How many times did it take you to get your driver's license, man? 
Please! 
Wake me up when we get there. 
Yes, sir. 
I'm sorry. 
Goodness, man! 
It's a nice suit, sir. 
It's really cool. 
Well, I appreciate it. 
Yeah, you know? 
Appreciate it. 
Got any music? 
Oh, yeah. 
Sure. 
I like to jam. 
Just so long as we can hear the dispatcher. 
That's good. 
- l never heard this station before. 
- Kind of funky. 
You like that? 
Last night these shelves were loaded with Elites. 
Now they're gone. 
Three dozen gorgeous rims. 
They didn't take anything else? 
They went for my good stuff. 
Chrome with gold trim. 
Five grand worth. 
What about the alarm? 
What about it? 
It went off. 
But it took you guys two hours to get here. 
My wheels are probably in Tijuana by now. 
Here's where they came in. 
Looks like they broke the glass, opened the handle, crawled in the window. 
Exactly. 
Shimmied down the shelf or something. 
This is a waste of time. 
That's not how they got in. 
Of course it is. 
Cut it out. 
That's not how they got in. 
This is the spot here. 
That's how I would've came in. 
If I was a thief. 
If I was a thief! 
Skylight. 
Just cut the alarm from the inside. 
I could take my time. 
Why take your time? 
Why would I take my time? 
It's heavy. 
Now, you tell me. 
How long would it take to carry 3 dozen of those out and load them in a truck? 
- Long time. 
- lt would take a very long time. 
But they probably had three or four guys working the damn thing- - 
Zip! 
Zip the shit up! 
Frank, hush. 
Because you know better. 
Come on. 
Don't lie to me. 
I'm the man. 
I'm the man, Frank. 
You're the man. 
Your 5000, sorry to tell you, is worth less than two on the street. 
Which don't go four ways with much juice once you rent a truck. 
And to rent a truck, that requires what? 
Credit card driver's license. 
Unless, of course you got your own truck. 
He's not gonna let us search his truck. 
What you mean," let us"? 
We the police. 
We need a warrant to do that. 
We don't even need a key. 
Detective, you can't do that. 
It's unconstitutional. 
Look at that. 
Look at this. 
Look. 
Solved the crime my first day on the job! 
We bad detectives. 
There they are! 
Filing a false report is a very serious crime. 
I'll handle this. 
Bring your weeble-wobble ass over here. 
- You like snacks? 
- Nothing makes me happier. 
You'll be snacking on the bottom of this shoe if this happens again. 
Now, you see them ridges? 
These ridges will be imprinted on the back of your ass permanently if this happens again. 
You understand? 
Thoroughly understand you. 
Every time you look at your ass there's gonna be a print there. 
It's gonna remind you of us. 
- And of you lying. 
- Right. 
Don't wanna see those ridges. 
Stop eating cold cuts because it's seeping through your pores. 
Will do. 
I'll put one ridge on your ass. 
Let's roll. 
That's cool. 
Let's get out of here. 
Detective, I know I'm new at this but I thought we were supposed to arrest the bad guys. 
Now he owes us one. 
So that's how it works. 
We let the little fish go, so that we can catch the big fish later. 
I got it. I got it. 
You mind if I drive? 
I know a shortcut. 
You might wanna buckle up. 
Are you in a hurry, sir? 
Just testing your car. 
Balancing out your shit. 
When was the last time you got all up on this thing? 
I've never gotten all up on anything, sir. 
Sometimes you gotta feed some speed to your ride. 
Sir! 
Watch it! 
This is the police! 
Move your busted-ass vehicle! 
Move, move, move, move, move! 
This is the LAPD. 
We'll pop one in your ass. 
We got guns and shit. 
I could get used to this! 
I like! 
I like! 
Used to what? 
Driving. 
See, my last partner did all the driving. 
Who was your partner? 
I don't wanna talk about it. 
Why? 
Hey, look, I'm deep, okay? 
There's just some places I can't talk about. 
We're partners. 
We gotta communicate. 
This thing's like a marriage. 
No, this is nothing like a marriage. 
- What is it like? 
- lt's more like a one-night stand. 
Wham, bam, thank you, officer. 
- lt's like that? 
- lt's like that. 
We're just gonna fight crime and zip the rest of that shit up. 
Are you married? 
- Girlfriend? 
- Not anymore. 
What happened? 
Work got in the way. 
See? 
Somebody took out a fire hydrant. 
- l'll handle this. 
- l gotta get back. I got a headache. 
We're on duty. 
But I need an aspirin. 
A big one, like a hockey puck. 
Gentlemen. 
Excuse me. 
Could you come here for a second? 
Relax, sir. 
Just take it easy for a second. 
Morning, officer. 
Morning. 
Where's your aspirins? 
Back there by the soda machines. 
Appreciate it. 
I wanna know how the car hit the fire hydrant. 
- Open the register! 
- Don't shoot! 
Come on, man! 
Oh, man! 
Come on! 
The safe too! 
Come on. 
37-King-5. 
Shots fired. 
Request help. 
41 8 West Fifth Street. 
Detective Malone! 
You okay? 
Oh, shit! 
Get back! 
Back! 
Get back! 
Freeze! 
Put your hands on the pavement! 
- Hands on the pavement! 
- There is no pavement! 
Put them on the Oodles of Noodles. 
- Put them on the noodles. 
- Chicken or beef? 
Chicken! 
Cool. 
Cool is good. 
Miles? 
Tulley? 
What are you doing? 
What am I doing? 
What are you doing? 
I'm freaking working over here. 
I'm coming in! 
Put the gun down! 
Put the gun down! 
Detective Malone, talk to me! 
Go out the back way! 
Go! 
The back way! 
Go out the back way! 
Detective, talk to me! 
Take two steps back! 
What the hell? 
Go! 
Hold it! 
Hold your fire! 
You okay? 
Listen, it's a dead end! 
No shit! 
He's behind those dumpsters. 
He's freaking out. 
He's got a gun. 
Back up! 
Get SWAT up here! 
Sharpshooters can take him off from the roof. 
No sharpshooters. 
Why the hell not? 
What are you doing here, man? 
- Who's he talking to? 
- l don't know. 
He high, man. He's hallucinating. 
Smoking that shit! 
He's high. 
Put down the gun and come out! 
Hold this. 
Hold on. 
I'm going in. 
What are you doing? 
What are you, crazy? 
Miles, what are you doing here? 
I just wanna talk to you before somebody gets hurt! 
Please put down the gun! 
- Son, come on. 
- Shut up! 
It hurts my heart to see a kid that has so much potential. 
- You're smarter than that. 
- I'm coming out! 
Listen. 
All right, now, goddamn it! 
What are you doing? 
What are you doing? 
You got me out here in this shit. 
How many times I told you forget the safe? 
Go straight for the cash drawer. 
Get in and get out. 
He's in the way. 
Now I can't even get a shot. 
I can't either. 
Why are you hitting mom-and-pop stores anyway? 
Look, you're a driver, man. 
You got skills. 
You can be out there on the road, man, doing your shit. 
I'm desperate! 
I need some money! 
And why the freak are we whispering? 
Back up, nigger! 
I saw you! 
- What are they talking about? 
- l don't know. 
I'm working on something here, and you're blowing it for me, man! 
I'm sorry, man. 
I'm messing up. 
- I'm messing up. 
- lt's all right. 
Look, I'm not mad at you. 
But you're gonna have to give me the gun and let me arrest you. 
Come on, man. 
Listen. I'll give you 1 0 grand. 
You know I'm good for it. 
I'm thinking like 50, man. 
Tulley, 50? 
That's pushing it, man! 
Damn! 
Twenty, and you'll spend one night in jail. 
That's the best I can do. 
That's it. 
Best I can do. 
All right, fine. 
But I'm keeping my gun. 
You cannot let me arrest you and keep the gun, man! Come on! 
Damn, I just got this, man. 
This is hard to find. 
But you're gonna have to give up the gun. 
Now, what you wanna do? 
You wanna give up the gun or you want them to put about 7 bullets in your ass? 
Okay, now give me that gun! 
Don't just hand it to me! 
I gotta take it from you. 
They're watching. 
This is gonna hurt a little. 
This is gonna hurt. 
Jesus! 
That's incredible! 
And remember : 
You don't know me anymore. 
I sure don't. 
You didn't used to be so violent. 
So he's like," Carlson, take my jacket." 
He's like," l got to do this." We're like," What are you doing?" 
He just goes right down the alley, right up to the guy. 
Next thing you know, he's taking the guy's gun. 
Dropped the guy with a punch. 
Just levelled him. 
I mean, blink and you would've missed it. 
Malone, in my office! 
Now! 
Not you, Carlson. 
I've been looking through your record. 
How come I never heard of you? 
I was undercover. 
On the down low. 
We need a guy to head Burglary. 
is that the real reason you're here? 
Yeah, sure. 
It's no secret. 
Burglary's been a problem division since we lost our lead detective last year. 
Now, usually we promote from within the ranks but these guys need someone new. 
So if you want the job, you got it. 
Excuse me? 
You're the new lead detective. 
Burglary division. 
Me? 
Technically, there's a 30-day qualifying period before I can make it official but with your record I don't think there'll be any problem. 
Well, say something! 
Thank you. 
Let's party? 
What is this? 
High school? 
Listen up. 
As of now, Detective Malone is Burglary's new acting lead detective. 
Get these processed ASAP. 
Thank you. 
I got some things I gotta do. 
I'll catch up with you later. 
I'll take these. 
- You know what to do with these? 
Great, sir. 
Sorry. 
- Captain Penelli? 
- I'm busy now. 
Oh, man! 
Shit! 
Damn! 
What? 
How do you want me to handle the rotation? 
I don't understand. 
What you mean," rotation"? 
The shifts. 
I can't figure out everything on the first day, all right? 
I notice you guys had a leak here. 
What's that about? 
One of the hot-water pipes burst, flooded all the vents. 
They had to flush out the whole system. 
This must be the guy everybody's talking about. 
Captain Penelli, Detective Malone. 
Malone, Penelli. 
I hear great things. 
It's a pleasure to meet you. 
Nice to meet you too there, sir! 
Very nice to meet you! 
Glad to be here. 
Gotta go! 
He's a strange one. 
Place is closed. 
I said we're closed. 
I should've locked up. 
Nice to see you, Lou. 
I'm looking for Miles. 
Well, I haven't seen him. 
I got an important message from his mother. 
Well, I still haven't seen him. 
Damn, you're good. 
You are good. 
Good morning. 
Listen up. 
Word is that Jean LaFleur is bringing a shipment of heroin through town. 
They want him in San Diego. 
SDPD's done an excellent job shutting down the harbor and the airports on him. 
Detective Malone just transferred. 
He'll head our Burglary division. 
Detective tell us a little about your plans. 
Well, I plan to fight crime. 
You know, shit like that. 
Great, then. 
Does anybody have any questions for Malone? 
Yeah, I got a question. 
What do you think about the P-31? 
P-31. 
What do you think? 
It's a piece of shit. 
What I mean is, we've all been having problems with the P-31, right? 
I'm just wondering what the new lead detective here plans to do about it. 
Well, all right. 
Well, Diaz, is it? 
Diaz? 
What do you think we should do about it, Diaz? 
I think we should scrap it. 
How many people think we should scrap the P-31? 
There it is. 
Scrapped. 
Why? 
Because you want it scrapped. 
It's out of there. 
P-31, out of there. 
No more. Gone. 
You want 31 flavours? 
Baskin-Robbins is where you wanna be. 
Be cool. 
That's my partner. 
Detective. 
What is it? 
I'd like to work with a P-40. 
Yeah, the P-40's good. 
P-40 it is! 
What's he doing? 
We just got those things. 
He's shaking things up. 
Maybe that's exactly what we need. 
I'm not a cop. 
This Tulley asshole wants to talk to you. 
He's down in interrogation. 
Right away. I'll talk with him. 
lnterrogation's this way. 
Knew that. ls he running his mouth? 
Tulley says he has information about another robbery. 
But he'll only talk to the officer who arrested him. 
I'll talk to him. 
Alone. 
We'll be watching. 
What's going on? 
You said I'd spend one night in jail. 
What do you wanna tell me? 
What is it? 
You said I'd only spend one night in jail. 
It's only been one night. 
Well, where's my 50 grand? 
I said 20 grand. 
Well, maybe it's 50 now! 
Because- - 
Detectives, I've been assigned to Mr. Tulley. 
Well, great. 
That's him. 
Oh, my God! 
What in the world? 
- Help me! 
- What's going on? 
Help! 
What is this? 
Oh, my God! 
Take your hands off my client! 
It's no use. 
He ain't talking! 
You have your hand over his mouth! 
I think we accomplished enough for one day. 
This guy said he has information on another case. 
I wanna know, are you jerking our chain or not? 
I'm not jerking your chain, fella. 
This guy Logan owes me 50 thousand dollars. 
If I don't get it soon I'm talking! 
Who's Logan? 
And what do you know about him? 
All I can tell you, sir, is that he's gay, gay, gay! 
I've had enough of this! 
You certainly have. 
Come with me. 
You'll be hearing from my office! 
- He made me bite my tongue. 
- Come here. 
He hit me here. 
Next time use a phone book on him. 
And they took my shoelace. 
Hearing from your office! 
Look how she's all over him. 
And then he said I was ugly and I couldn't read good. 
Hey, man. 
What's up? 
Some guy's been calling for you. 
- Who was it? 
- Said he's your old partner. 
He hopes you found what you're looking for. 
Your health benefits expire soon. 
Whatever the hell that's supposed to mean. 
Shit! 
Bingo! 
What is it with you and the heating ducts, sir? 
Cold. 
You don't feel that? 
Very cold. 
But I'm busy. 
What is it you want? 
I just tried to pull up your records. 
I couldn't find any Malone. 
Oh, that's probably because it was spelled.... 
When I put the name in the list- - 
The badge number doesn't exist. 
Let me talk to you. 
- l wanna find out what's going on. 
- You're gonna find out. 
Now, look. 
What I'm about to tell you is classified. 
You tell anyone, I will bust your ass down to parade detail. 
I've been on that detail. 
That's permanent horseshit patrol. 
This place is a cesspool. 
But listen. 
I'm not from West Covina. 
I'm from internal Affairs. 
Oh, man! 
All right? 
This place is a cesspool. 
- l can't believe I didn't notice! 
- lt is! 
I mean, it doesn't seem like a cesspool. 
Believe it, man! 
There's a lot of dirty shit going on here! 
That's why they sent me here. 
I'm the supercop. 
They said," Go, investigate. 
Do what you do. 
Find another supercop. 
Y'all supercop up as a team, and crack down the shit." 
" Crack it down." That's what I'm here to do. 
Are we the only guys that know about it? 
We're in the shit now! 
You are a good cop, Carlson. 
But damn it, man, you just dug too deep. 
What do you want me to do? 
Good thing you asked. 
Keep your eyes open. 
Okay? I need you to be here. 
And watch my back. 
Watch my back. 
Got it, sir. 
I'm out of here. 
The other way. 
Go back. 
Shit! 
Evidence room. 
Shit! 
There you are. I just got a call. 
41 3 in progress at the airport. 
Go ahead. I'll catch up. 
Bullshit! 
Someone just stole a museum exhibit from a cargo hold. 
That's my problem? 
You're lead detective. 
Get out there now! 
The fbi and Customs Service is already on the case. 
- Why are you standing here? 
- They won't let me in. 
Feds are all over it. 
That's bullshit! 
These boxes contained an entire Egyptian temple. 
Excuse me, here. 
Let me see this. 
Man! 
And who are you? 
Malone. 
LAPD. 
Agent Gray. 
fbi. 
We'll let you boys in after we're done. 
Look at all this stuff. 
Look. 
They nearly destroyed all this stuff and they didn't take none of it. 
Look, Officer Malone. 
Detective. 
You know, you're out of your jurisdiction and you're over your head. 
I'm over my head? 
No, I'm over your head because your head's up your ass. 
You're interfering with a federal investigation, officer. 
Now, if you and your bunch wanna feel important you can help secure the outer perimeter. 
Are we clear? 
We clear. 
And please tell your men not to touch anything on their way out. 
- lt's like that? 
- Yeah, it's like that. 
" Head up your ass." That was great. 
I couldn't believe you said that. 
He called me" officer." 
I'm lead detective. 
I have 1 6 citations. 
You think that comes easy? 
Come on. 
The guy's nothing but an fbi asshole. 
He thinks we're good for nothing but sucking down doughnuts. 
Let them chase their own goddamn temple. 
They weren't looking for no temple. 
They were looking for drugs. 
Yes, drugs. 
It's the oldest trick in the book. 
You smuggle it in boost it before it hits customs, right? 
That's how all the big boys do it. 
All they have to do is look for a truck with a" B" on it. 
What do you mean," B"? 
" Bonded." 
Bonded trucks can get into bonded warehouses. 
Let me ask you : 
How do you know all this stuff? 
Did a little work in bonded warehouses. 
All right. 
So what are we waiting for? 
Let's do something, all right? 
Come on. Call in air support. 
Dispatch, this is 37-King-5 put me through to South Bay air support. 
10-12. 
I've got a white panel truck B-961, southbound on Wheeler near the Manhattan Beach intersection. 
Roger. 
We're close. 
Shit! 
Now you're in a hurry? 
Sometimes you gotta feed a little speed to your ride. 
You know what I'm saying? 
Here we go. 
Check out the driver. 
Five-feet-six, greasy hair, messy, very dishevelled and- - 
Are you a hairdresser or a detective, man? 
That's a jailhouse tat. 
Driver did a stretch somewhere. 
1 0-1 2. 
Requesting backup. 
LAPD, this is Agent Gray. 
FBI. 
Stand down. 
I repeat.. 
Stand down. 
This is bullshit! 
Screw them. 
Come on! 
Let's do it! 
Come on, you! 
Come on, get the door. 
Come on! 
Drop your weapons! 
Put it down. 
All right, don't move! 
Stand still! 
Put it down! 
Malone! 
Take him! 
He's yours! 
Don't you run from me! 
Don't you run! 
Let's see those hands, butterball. 
Come here! 
You wanna make me run? 
Come back here! 
Come back here! 
Bring your ass here! 
Come here! 
Come here! 
It's okay. 
Don't worry. 
I'm a cop. 
All right? 
Damn! 
Don't you know better than to run from the police? 
I do. 
You got me tired. I don't like to get tired. 
When I get tired I got ass to whup. 
That's what I'm about to do. 
Get your ass up! 
Bingo. 
That's the shit. 
We showed them. 
We showed them, and that's what I wanted to do, you know? 
- Put this into evidence. 
- Exactly. 
Evidence. I'll go up with it. 
I want you interrogating those men right now. 
No. 
See, I need to go up with this stuff and book it into evidence personally. 
Why? 
I gotta go through it for clues and shit. 
lnterrogate the suspects. 
Find out where they were going. 
Then, when you get them to talk, you can go through all the evidence you want. 
But, sir.... lf l get the clue, it'd make for a better ass-whupping interrogation. 
Let's hear it for Detective Malone! 
That's it! 
I want a lawyer. 
You cops can't do this. 
I got news for you. 
I ain't a cop. 
God, he's good. 
I checked. 
West Covina never heard of him. 
- So you know. 
- Know what? 
He's internal Affairs. 
What are you talking about? 
He's not l.A. 
He's not? 
Hell, no. 
He's fbi. 
But he hates the fbi. 
That's to throw you off. 
You think this is an accident? 
He knew about the heroin from the start. 
fbi planted him here. 
Thought he'd get first jump on the burglary. 
Afraid we'd screw it up. 
Pencil-dicks. 
You don't get that training at the academy. 
No, that's old school, man. 
You're crushing my head! 
That's federal government training. 
Like Navy SEAL stuff. 
Let's go give him a hand. 
All right! 
All right! 
I'll talk! 
Oh, man! 
Look at you. 
It was all worth it for you, baby. 
What are you doing up there? 
I'm just so happy that we're keeping these drugs off the street. 
Get over it. 
They're going right back out again. 
Why? 
Because the fbi wants to take it to their lab right away. 
Roll it out. 
Malone, come on! 
Let's go. 
Come on, Malone. 
Detective. 
That heroin belongs to Jean LaFleur. 
We've been after him for 5 years. 
He keeps shifting his operations between the U.S. and Mexico. 
We're taking it down to our lab right now. 
That's not a good idea. 
Why not? 
Why don't we just keep it here? 
LaFleur doesn't know we have it. 
We could use it for bait. 
You mean a sting? 
Exactly. 
A sting! 
LaFleur expects these drugs to be in San Diego in three hours. 
What kind of sting operation can you get off the ground before then? 
The driver told me one of the guys on the truck was new. 
You can replace him with somebody else. 
Then catch LaFleur when he goes to pick up the drugs. 
Bam! Got him! 
Let me get this straight. 
You're volunteering to escort these drugs into the hands of the most dangerous dealer in the northern hemisphere? 
Hell, no! 
What do you need to make it work? 
- Me? 
- You're the man for the job! 
fbi will have tactical command, but we'll follow your lead. 
It's very brave. 
Let's go. 
There's not much time. 
Way to go, Malone. 
Way to go. 
- I'm just suggesting some shit. 
- We need more men like you! 
All right. 
Hurry up. 
Go. Get out of here! 
Wait. 
Hold up. 
Wait a minute. 
You wanted to go. 
I'm getting you out of here. 
Go! 
You wouldn't still be here unless that diamond was here. 
I want my cut! 
There ain't nothing to cut. 
I gotta get the diamond first. 
Go get it. I'll wait. 
I'm trying to. 
First, I gotta run a sting on a drug dealer. 
You're a goddamn liar! 
Would I make this shit up? 
Get out of here! 
- l'll see you at Lou's tomorrow. 
- l wanna talk about this! 
I don't know what you're doing but it ain't gonna work! 
And let me get my gun back! 
Look. 
Maybe this isn't a good idea, you know? 
- This is a great idea. lt'll work. 
- Brilliant. 
- LaFleur's looking for this. 
- We know what we're doing, detective. 
Oh, I'm a detective now. 
Give us a level, please. 
All right, detective. 
The objective is to have these men see you as if you were one of them : 
A member of the criminal underworld. 
It's important your speech and your behaviour are congruent with their expectation of a fellow criminal. 
I get it. 
Sort of" walk the walk." 
That's right. 
You have to look, act and even think like a criminal. 
Change your speech patterns too. 
Criminals like to use slang terminology and profanity and so forth especially with regard to police and authority figures. 
You mean like," Shut the hell up, you dickless FBl- -" 
- That's right. 
-" You stupid ass." 
- That'll do. 
-" You tight- -" 
Enough! 
All right, listen up. 
LaFleur's a killer. 
If he senses anything amiss, Malone is gonna be in one hell of a tight spot. 
If anything happens to me, forget everything I ever told you. 
You mean about internal Affairs? 
No, Carlson. I mean about everything. 
Detective, saddle up. 
Good luck. 
Carlson, remember. 
Forget it! 
Time to go. 
Detective. 
If my client gets a scratch on him while he's in your custody I'll see your badge is revoked and you're thrown in jail. 
Okay? 
You can't touch me. 
He'll be fine, counsellor. 
Malone, let's get this show on the road. 
Drive. 
Buckle up. 
Give me video. 
Let's get one thing straight. 
This is my side here and that's your side there. 
Stay on your side and I'm gonna stay on mine. 
Gentlemen. 
Keep the chatter to a minimum. 
You don't like the show, change the channel. 
And keep this channel clear. 
Who is this guy? 
That's Malone. 
I can't drive if you do that. 
Drive! 
We're coming up on our exit. 
All units, this is Gray. 
Fall back and keep your distance. 
We're approaching the site. 
LAPD, take the south side. 
We'll take the north. 
They're headed into warehouse 3. 
Focus in. 
Closer. 
This is it. 
- You sure? 
- Yeah. 
Warehouse 3. 
All right, Benny, sit tight and keep your mouth shut. 
Thanks for the tip. 
What's Malone doing? 
They're coming in behind you. 
Get ready. 
Here he comes. 
That's what I'm talking about! 
- That's the shit. 
- You're right! 
All 500 kilos! 
What are you talking about? 
Let's get out! I want my cut! 
- You still got it? 
- We still have a signal. 
It's just distorted. 
Can you hear him? 
We can't get out of here, okay? 
They got cops everywhere. 
So? 
You're one of them. 
I'm a drug dealer now. 
Man, listen to me. 
You're a jewel thief. 
I'm a drug dealer now! 
Why you selling this when you got that diamond? 
Just like old times. 
I don't believe that shit! 
is this a reunion? 
Look what we got here. 
Give it up. 
Isn't that beautiful? 
Say bye. 
Welcome to the party. 
Son of a bitch! 
We've lost him. 
I'll enjoy doing you more than I did Eddie. 
Shut up! 
Oh, my God! 
Oh, my God! 
- Know anything about this? 
- l don't know shit! 
I'm gonna throw up. 
What the hell? 
All units, stand by. 
What's going on? 
I don't know! 
I never know what's going on! 
Take it down! 
Here! 
Bring it in! 
Out of the truck. 
Out of the truck! 
Benny, what's going on? 
It took longer than I thought. 
- What happened to your face? 
- Nothing. 
Not a big deal. 
Who hired these two guys? 
I did. 
You told me to get guys. 
You didn't introduce me. 
How you doing? 
Pete. 
Nice to meet you. 
Heard a lot about you. 
And who might you be? 
Don't mess with him. 
That's a stone-cold killer. 
You don't want to mess with him. 
He's stone-cold. 
That boy is bad. I seen him rip somebody's guts out through their ass and their eyes fell out. 
Do the move you do! 
The gut-and-eyes move. 
That's where they went splat. 
Just dropped them. 
I'm bad. 
I'll rip your lips off and kiss my ass with them shits. 
I seen him do it. 
I do that. 
That's how I get down. 
I'll rip your tongue out and lick my balls with them. 
Shut up. 
Check him out. 
Francois, you search him. 
- We're moving in. 
- No, wait. 
This must be a part of his plan. 
What plan? 
He's unarmed and outnumbered. 
Trust me. 
You should see Malone's resume. 
This is like a walk in the park for him. 
I must tell you, Pete. 
You look the part you certainly talk the talk but you still stink like a cop. 
Damn it! 
I knew he would catch us, man. 
Shut up! 
That's bullshit. 
Come on, man. 
Just talk to him. 
We might get out of here! 
See? 
He's lying! 
If I was a cop, would I have busted his shit? 
That's bleeding! 
Lock him in the car. 
Get him out of here. 
If I was a cop- - 
Shut up! 
My nose bleeding! 
Damn! 
You better tell us the truth. 
He's a cop. 
He hijacked the truck. 
This is a setup. 
If I was a cop, FBls would be in here right now, man taking everybody to jail! 
I think I have an idea. 
You wanna prove you aren't a cop? 
You say he's lying. 
Damn right. 
Shoot him. 
Shoot him. 
No problem. 
You son of a bitch! 
I meant, kill him. 
You didn't say that. 
You just said," Shoot him." 
You wanna prove you aren't a cop? 
Kill him. 
There ain't no coming back for him. 
That's it. 
We're moving in. 
All units, move in. 
Let's go! 
Shit! 
Give me the diamond or I'll pop one in your ass! 
You had your chance. 
Freeze! 
LAPD! 
Show me your hands! 
Nice shot. 
Get out of the car! 
Turn around! 
Shit! 
All units, this is Agent Gray, fbi. 
We have no authority to pursue the suspect beyond our border. 
Do not cross into Mexico! 
Pursuit of suspect heading southbound. 
We have an undercover officer onboard. 
I repeat : 
We have a friendly onboard. Over! 
Roger that! 
Hold on! 
Shit! 
Look out! 
Get him! 
I'm glad to see y'all! 
What you waiting for? 
We can't, Malone. 
We have no jurisdiction. 
Damn that! 
Damn the jurisdiction! 
Go! Now! 
We cannot cross into Mexico. 
- You can't? 
- No. 
- You can't? 
- No! 
Watch me. 
Believe that! 
Move your ass! 
Damn it! 
One bullet. 
Come on, Miles! 
Shit! 
- You're under arrest. 
- What are you doing? 
I'm arresting you before they get here. 
I'll blow your head off before they get here. 
The way I see it is you got 30 seconds before they make a pinata out of you. 
What are they talking about? 
Malone is an expert negotiator. 
He's an expert, sir. 
You got two choices. 
You can wind up somebody's bitch or somebody's senorita. 
Make up your mind. 
Your choice. 
I got three choices. 
Maybe I just tell them who you are. 
You'll shut your mouth. 
Maybe I'll cut you in on the diamond. 
Shithead, I got the goddamn diamond. 
Let me get that. 
I'm your only way out! 
Now, give me the gun. 
You don't wanna go to jail in Mexico. 
Nobody wanna go to jail in Mexico. 
They put burritos in your ass. 
Shut up! 
Come on, Deke. 
Give me the gun. 
Come on! 
They think I'm a cop! 
They think I'm a cop, man! 
I can help you, okay? 
You don't wanna die here. 
Now give that up. 
If you screw me, I swear to God, I'll come back for you. 
I'll come back for you! 
Give me the gun! 
There you go. 
Let me get that from you. 
Come on. 
Let it go. 
There you go. 
This is gonna hurt a bit. 
Holy Christ! 
That's for Eddie. 
You son of a bitch! 
Come back here! 
You son of a bitch! 
Miles, you die! 
You all right? 
I needed a vacation anyway, right? 
The fbi needs to talk to you, Detective Malone. 
Peterson, regional director, fbi. 
We need to talk. 
Wait a minute. 
Slow down. 
No, lieutenant, I will not slow down. 
is this man one of yours or not? 
You bet your ass he is. 
Well, I'm gonna find out what happened here even if it means putting your entire department under federal review. 
Nice work. 
My office spent an hour talking to West Covina and the U.S. Attorney's Office trying to find out just who it is you're working for. 
Now we know it's not the Bureau. 
It's time that you gave us an explanation. 
I'm a federale. 
A federale? 
Look across that border. 
What do you see? 
That is the Democratic Republic of Mexico. 
You're Mexican? 
That's right. 
On my mother's father's side. 
I can see it. 
Glacias. 
Thank you. 
Gentlemen, I shouldn't be telling y'all this. 
I could lose my federale-hood. 
Your what? 
My federale-hood! 
Look, I had to throw you guys off, okay? 
I was doing it for my country. 
The red the white and the green. 
If you'll excuse me, I have to cross this border and school some of my compadres, you know on things we like to talk about. 
So y'all stay up. 
Be cool. 
What's happening? 
Hook a brother up with a taco! 
A burrito! 
I can't believe so much bad shit can happen on such a beautiful day. 
Yeah, what? 
I think your Spanish is a little rusty. 
You just told those men you got a big cat in your pants. 
That's a Latin thing. Macho. 
You wouldn't understand. 
No, I think I do understand Logan. 
What? 
How'd you know it was me? 
I started thinking if I was Logan and had my diamond hidden in a police building, what would I do? 
So I thought like a crook. 
is that right? 
I don't believe this. 
He's a major felon. 
This is one hell of a bust, Carlson. 
It's a hell of a bust for us. 
It's just too bad we can't make it. 
Say what? 
You heard the fbi. 
They're extremely strict about pursuing suspects across international borders. 
And you're just out of our jurisdiction. 
You're...? 
Exactly, because I'm across the- - lf I'm across the border and you're over there, there's no way you- - 
I love this jurisdiction shit! 
I guess this is the last time I'm gonna see you boys. 
But maybe we'll catch you later. 
is it like that? 
Yeah. lt's like that. 
Right there. 
Jurisdiction. 
Thanks. 
Viva Las Mexico and I'm out! 
Oh, boy. 
Don't! 
Wait! 
Not my homework! 
No! 
Stop it! No! 
Problem, gentlemen? 
Hey, dork-brain! 
If you weren't a girl, I'd beat your face off. 
If you weren't a girl, I'd beat your face off. 
You're calling me a girl? 
You called me one! 
You asked for it. 
Now get out of here! 
Forget those guys. 
They're jealous because you're smart and funny. 
And girls like that. 
What girls? 
Lots of girls. 
I mean... 
I like you. 
I don't like you. 
Now everybody thinks I need a girl to fight for me. 
You are a dork-brain. 
My nose! 
Wimp! 
Moe and Larry in the house. 
Grant, what have we got out back? 
All clear, sir. 
Matthews, what do you got? 
Returnable cans, sir. 
I'm up to 75 cents. 
Hey, we got a cab. 
Here comes Curly. 
The Three Stooges. 
Check it out, Ivan's packing. 
Thank you! 
We've got a briefcase. 
Hart, waiting for visual confirmation. 
No disc yet. 
Suitcase is opening. 
This woman's ass is in the way. 
Hart, we can't see a damn thing. 
We need to see the discs. 
- This broad's got two asses! 
- Do something! 
Excuse me. 
You wanting something else? 
Yeah. 
You know what? 
I really love this borscht. 
Or, as they say in Russian : 
We got the discs. 
We're moving in! 
Get down! 
Keep your hands where I can see them! 
No English. 
Nobody moves until I see some goddamn" Lazhitsa na pol"! 
Sir, he's turning purple! 
Hart, until we secure, you stay. 
That is one really, really purple Russian, sir! 
He's still armed! 
Nobody moves! 
Hands up! 
Back off! 
No, sir. 
He's not gonna die. 
He's not good enough for that. 
His victims didn't get a chance to choke on a peanut, did they, sir? 
Now you're going down. 
Drop the guns or I'll kill her. 
Ivan, out the back. 
You're not killing anyone. 
Party's over! 
How's your head, my little piroshki? 
This is gonna put you away for a long time. 
Let's get that ambulance in here! 
- Shut up! 
- Stay with me! 
- I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry. 
You did a great job! 
Nice work. 
See you back there. 
Come on, Hart. The van's waiting. 
I got Grant shot. 
I shouldn't have moved. 
Come on, you made a choice. 
It was wrong, but that's it. 
It's over. 
By the way, you look like hell. 
- Morning, Mrs. Schwartz. Schnatzie. 
- Good morning, Gracie. 
Hart. 
Yes, sir. 
ETA, 20 minutes. 
No problem. 
Breakdown? 
Yes, sir. Negative. 
Do not need assistance. 
Ten-four. 
Yes, sir, I know it's hot. 
Hey, you cannot park- - 
It's an emergency. Official business. 
Aside, please. 
Thank you. 
Official business. 
Step aside. 
Hey, get lost! 
I'm waiting here. 
FBI. 
You might want to stay out of this. 
Excuse me. 
Sir, ma'am, please back off. 
All right. 
I need eight double-tall- - 
Eight double-tall lattes. 
One with no foam. 
Five decaf lattes with a long straw. 
Four caramel macchiattos. 
Double up on the cup. 
Two blueberry scones with the little granules on top and one Starbucks compilation CD. 
No! 
I would like.... 
What's going on? 
Where's McDonald? 
Could we put out an APB on my Frappuccino? 
It's in the bag. 
Did he say anything about last night? 
Relax. 
Don't annoy him. 
Don't say anything. 
Don't argue. 
I don't argue. 
I never argue. 
When do I argue? 
I might have a heated discussion with somebody. 
Is this you not arguing? 
Because you suck at it. 
Morning, everybody. 
Morning, sir. 
It's.... 
Sir. 
Okay, everybody. 
I know you're all concerned about Grant's condition. 
So I'm happy to report Jerry's gonna be fine. 
He says he's expecting lots of gifts. 
Okay, everybody. 
So much for the good news. 
We got another letter from the Citizen. 
Arson, explosives, poison this guy never works the same way twice. 
The only thing we know for sure is, we get these letters full of incomprehensible riddles he strikes and suddenly the clues make sense. 
This one is down in Intelligence. 
Hopefully, we'll get a lead before somebody gets killed. 
In the meantime Matthews, get a team together. 
Sir, you want me to take point? 
For five years you've wanted it. 
Last night, you earned it. 
Pick your team. 
I want preliminaries by 3. 
That's it. 
Sir...? 
Who's buying me lunch? 
Sir, I would like to talk about what happened last night. 
I didn't exactly follow orders- - 
" Exactly" follow orders? 
There's no such thing. 
You follow orders or you don't. 
No arguments, sir. None whatsoever. 
Until the hearing, you're out of the field. 
The hearing is totally warranted. 
Wouldn't I be better on the Citizen case? 
I have a background in profiling and decoding. 
I could contribute. 
Like you contributed last night? 
By putting yourself and 5 agents in jeopardy? 
I'll save the rest for the review board. 
You will bury yourself under a mountain of paperwork. 
Discussion is over. 
Mike, give me a pint. 
Rough day? 
The worst. 
Sure you want a whole one? 
Yeah. 
Hit me bigtime, baby. 
Hey, Einstein. 
If you figure out that Citizen letter, let me know. 
Congratulations on the op. 
It's a big shot. 
Thanks. 
How are you doing? 
You okay? 
I'm good. 
You're starting early today. 
Yeah, I'm gonna get chip-faced. 
Want to join me? 
I'd love to, but I have a pressing social engagement. 
Beth! 
Brownie meeting. 
Mike, give me a beer and.... 
Milk. Give her milk. 
White wine spritzer. 
Are most of the people in here agents? 
As a matter of fact, here's an agent. 
Gracie Hart. 
Beth Carter. 
Right back to you. 
Beth is an undergrad at Vassar, doing a paper on law enforcement. 
I'm helping her get an inside look. 
I bet she'll do the same for you. 
Gracie, I would love to get a woman's point of view. 
You're barking up the wrong tree. Right, Hart? 
Do all the women have to wear those really masculine shoes? 
I get these made special by the guy that put the tattoo on my ass. 
We'll leave you with Ben and Jerry. 
Catch you later. 
- Nice meeting you. 
- You too. 
Hope you have a good time at the mall. 
Wohop is the place. 
Wohop is good, but if you like variety, you go to La Chinita Linda. 
Their rice and beans are slamming. 
I don't want variety. 
I get pork fried rice every- - 
I figured it out! 
I tried to create a content-based pattern similar to his previous letters. 
But this time, he used a signifier. 
In this case, the word" miss" in the subsequent letters. 
Will you let me finish? 
It's the Miss United States Pageant. 
Yeah. 
Intelligence thought so too. 
What do we got? 
Miss United States from San Antonio, Texas, home of the Alamo. 
I forgot the Alamo. 
The pageant lasts three days. 
Preliminaries, conferences the live telecast. 
It's a logistical nightmare. 
Not just a babe-fest. 
Jesus, we've only got 48 hours. 
Okay, gentlemen. 
Where do we start? 
You might want to call the network and pageant people. 
Set up a meeting. 
Because you'll probably need their cooperation. 
Yeah, I can do that. 
Let's do that. 
What about jurisdiction? 
The Citizen has been ours from the start. 
You might want to call San Antonio. 
Grease some wheels so they like us when we need manpower and tech. 
While I'm at it, let's do that. 
Good idea. 
He loves to make a splash. 
His target will be public like one of these outdoor prelims or a TV broadcast. 
Telecasters at the convention center. 
We're gonna need surveillance on the interior perimeter. 
We'll need more. 
There's a million places only these bikini-stuffers can go : 
backstage areas, hotel rooms.... 
We need to get somebody in there. 
Now I'm thinking undercover. 
Good idea, boss. 
I got just the girl. 
That's nothing. 
Check this out. 
Compliments of my daughter : 
the" Dress Up Sally" web site. 
What did I tell you? 
Hot, right? 
Yeah, baby. 
You got a little problem. 
She's perfect! 
Look to the left. 
Down... down.... 
- There you go. 
-" On maternity leave"? 
That's not gonna work. 
Not unless it's" The Miss Lamaze Pageant." 
Can you do a search? 
Female field agents under 35. 
Jensen, Jensen! 
Wait, wait, wait, wait! 
I got it, I got it! 
Oh, no! 
That's right, that's right! 
You think that's good? 
Check this out. 
I got the winner right here. 
Scorekeepers ready? 
This is the best part. 
He's right behind me, isn't he? 
Not really my color, is it? 
Sir, we were just looking for someone to go undercover at the pageant. 
And I'm the best we have. 
It doesn't inspire much confidence. 
Get back to work. 
- Hart, shouldn't you be at a desk? 
- Yes, sir. 
You don't say anything? 
Made me look like an idiot. 
Do I have eyes in the back of my head? 
- He was standing right behind me. 
- What were we gonna say? 
- What? 
- This one. 
Are you kidding? 
It's Hart. 
Cut it off. 
Let's go back to work. 
Very funny. 
Hold on. 
That's not bad. 
Hold on, nothing. Hit the save button because you won't see that again. 
- What do you say? 
- No freaking way. 
Why not? 
I won't parade around in a swimsuit like some bimbo named Gracie Lou Freebush, and all she wants is world peace. 
It wouldn't be like that. 
You'd be on the undercover team. 
Right. In a thong. 
In a tasteful one-piece! 
You do a few butt-shaping exercises you could pull this off. 
You know what? 
Pull this off. 
Is it because McDonald hates me? 
Or is it, like, a woman thing? 
Don't kid yourself. 
Nobody thinks of you that way. 
He's punishing me, isn't he? 
I had to beg him to let you do this. 
That's right. Like it or not, you screwed up, pal. 
Sit down, sit down. 
I've never been in a beauty pageant. 
I don't even own a dress. 
I don't even own a brush. 
Which part of that is supposed to shock me? 
Let's suspend reality for a second and pretend I said yes. 
I got to do everything? 
Like the whole big hair and the makeup and- - 
Damn right. 
The spinning, the twirling, the smiling, the cute little tap number. 
Hundred bucks on Matthews. 
I don't know. 
She's got rage. 
I'll take that bet. 
Yeah, baby. 
So you're saying I have to wear the bathing suit? 
Yeah, you have to wear the bathing suit. 
Okay. 
You go, girl. 
Where am I gonna put my gun? 
No place I want to know about. 
What could possibly motivate anybody to enter a beauty pageant? 
Scholarship money, a chance to see the world broaden your horizons- - 
So join the Marines. 
It's like feminism never even happened. 
Any woman that does this is catering to misogynistic Neanderthal mentality. 
I dated Young Miss Scarsdale. 
Can you really be this superficial? 
Hard to believe, right? 
Here we are. 
Therefore, we'd like to use one of our team undercover. 
Am I hearing this correctly? 
Kathy, these people want to put one of their agents in the pageant. 
They want her to win? 
No, ma'am. 
We will need your help with the judging so our agent is in the top five to have access to all the areas at all times. 
- Absolutely not. 
- Miss Morningside we understand how important this beauty pageant- - 
Excuse me. 
This is not a beauty pageant. 
This is a scholarship program. 
And it has been ever since my reign. 
I fully intend on maintaining that credo. 
Absolutely, Miss Morningside. 
We're here to protect the girls. Women. 
Scholarship ladies. 
There's nothing more important to me than the safety of my girls. 
I'd rather cancel the pageant than have them blown up. 
Especially without their knowledge. 
We went to the network to cancel, but they refused. 
We can't force them. 
I'm confused. 
What state is she going to be from? 
All the winners have been chosen. 
We recently discovered some information about Miss New Jersey. 
And her performance in a little film called Arma Get It On. 
Was that her? 
Oh, yeah! 
She was gonna drop out pretty soon, if you know what I mean. 
Do you have an agent in mind? 
Sorry. 
Let me get you Victor Melling's number. 
Frank. 
He's our pageant consultant. 
Frank. 
Maybe he can do something to help. 
Frank! 
This is my assistant, Frank Tobin. 
Hi, everyone. 
Would you get these people Victor's number, please? 
And get me a spring water. 
And tuck in your shirt. 
That, that was... a water for you and.... 
Victor Melling's number. 
Mr. Melling. 
How are you? 
If you are Grace Hart, I quit here and now. 
I'm having a bad hair day. 
Bad hair decade, really. 
I'm Eric Matthews. 
We spoke. 
Your hair is perfect. 
However, I can't accept this job. 
There's no way I can make this woman ready in two days. 
Please, Mr. Melling, give it a chance. Sit down. 
Have lunch. 
Totally on the Bureau. 
I suppose that would be the civilized thing to do. 
I'll take a rain check. 
I got to take care of some FBI stuff. 
That thing I told you about that I gotta do. 
But I'll see you later. We'll hang out. 
You like caps? 
I'll get you an official FBI cap. 
See you later. 
What a pity. 
- Are you hungry? 
- Yeah. 
- Yes. 
- Yeah. 
It is always" yes," never" yeah." Sit down. 
Miss United States is always well-spoken and polite. 
Do you understand? 
Watch the hands, garçon. 
- Excuse me. 
- It's all right. 
I have a feeling we're going to need a drop cloth later. 
Could I have another cabernet sauvignon? 
Another keg for you? 
- I'm good, thanks. 
- That's okay, Philip. 
So, how long have you been doing this pageant-training thing? 
I'm sorry? 
What was the question? 
I was distracted by a half-masticated cow rolling around in your wide-open trap. 
Excuse me? 
What is your problem? 
- Problem? 
- Yeah. 
I mean, yes. 
Have I offended you in some way? 
You've been completely antagonistic to me from the second I walked in. 
I was once the most sought-after, highly paid consultant in pageant history. 
I had no idea. 
Every season, girls would plead with me to train them. 
Ten out of 11 years my girls were crowned. 
The year we lost, the winner was a deaf-mute. 
You can't beat that. 
Then in' 96 my girl froze like a puddle halfway through her aria from La Bohème. 
Afterwards, she told a reporter from Pageant Magazine that I was a perfectionist who had harangued her to within an inch of her sanity. 
Of course, after that article came out nobody wanted me. 
Okay. 
With all due respect here why did Miss Morningside suggest you? 
Because I am the best. 
Or perhaps it's because everyone else worth having had a contestant. 
They had their Southern belles, their Midwestern farmers' daughters. 
Spunky Western cowgirls. 
And I have Dirty Harriet. 
Will you desist? 
Yeah. 
Yes. 
Oh, my God. 
I haven't seen a walk like that since Jurassic Park. 
It's been working really well for me for the past 30 years, all right? 
Well, glide, now. 
Glide. 
Don't look down, don't look down. 
Don't look down, look up. 
Your chin should be parallel to the floor. 
Now glide. 
Glide. 
It's not the bloody Ice Capades. 
Gliding. 
No, no. 
Don't pick your feet up. 
Don't pick your feet up. 
Why are you picking your feet up? 
Because I'm preparing to run away. 
No, wait. 
Wait. 
Watch me. 
Glide. 
Glide. 
See? 
Glide. 
It's all in the buttocks. 
Don't I look pretty? 
It takes a very secure man to walk like that. 
Roll your hips. 
Head up, head up. 
Keep gliding- - 
I'm gliding here! 
What are you, blind? 
Asshole. 
Look how she walks. 
She's floating. 
Lightly ascending from cloud to cloud towards heaven. 
He takes one look at that fake rack he's gonna send her right back. 
Look, she's gonna cry again. 
" If I only had a brain!" 
I am somewhat less than amused. 
How's she doing? 
With some intensive work she'll be ready for the world's finest trailer park. 
Thank you! 
Both painful and grotesque. 
Isn't it? 
Oh, my God! 
Mr. Vic, we got everything you asked for. 
Where do we start? 
Teeth, hair, manicure, pedicure. 
Which one first? 
What are you gonna do to my teeth? 
Hopefully, remove the beer stains and steak residue. 
Can't I get some Novocain? 
It's only a cleaning. 
Sweeney Todd, what are you doing? 
Your hair should make a statement. 
As long as it's not," Thanks for the Country Music Award." 
You'll be lucky if I can get it untangled. 
No mercy. 
Can I borrow that drill? 
Attention. 
Attention. 
All hair removal units, wax, electrolysis, laser to commence at 2300 hours. 
Bikini wax. 
How you doing? 
Ever seen one this big? 
Sandwich, I mean. 
That's a lot of meat. 
Thank you! 
Nobody said this job was easy. 
This earpiece lets you hear anybody on our frequencies. 
I don't need it. 
With all this foil, I'm getting HBO. 
This is a pin camera. 
There's an actual lens in there. 
It provides a digital video feed to our hookups. 
Here's your new I.D.s. 
Pageant identity. 
Gracie Lou Freebush? 
I remembered you liked that. 
Well, my IQ just dropped 10 points. 
More... fluffy. 
Eyebrows. 
There should be two. 
Another two coats. 
And a sealant. 
Unbelievable. 
Where the hell is she? 
What could possibly be taking this long? 
Hart, is that you? 
I'm in a dress, I have gel in my hair, I haven't slept I'm starved and I'm armed. 
Don't mess with me. 
I'm fine. 
I'm cool. I'm good. 
Yeah, that's her. 
Mr. Vic, nice work! 
Thank you. 
My God, I'm good. 
Okay, Gracie Lou, listen up. 
" Operation Thong" has commenced. 
Why don't you stun-gun yourself? 
I knew she'd like that one. 
Victor? 
Try not to speak. 
Victor! 
Miss Morningside, if it's possible you look more radiant than ever. 
Then I guess it's possible. 
Hello. 
Hi. 
Miss Hart? 
! 
I mean, Miss Freebush. 
Victor, I see you haven't completely lost your touch. 
You look absolutely perfect. 
And you're just in time for the orientation breakfast. 
You'll take the bags to the room? 
It's been a while since you've been with us but you remember how everything goes. 
One little mistake and I'm a bloody bellhop. 
Ohio. Oh-hi-yo! 
Washington. 
Nice apples. 
Original. 
You come up with that all by yourself? 
- Miss Greenbush! 
- I got it. 
I got it. 
New Jersey? 
Welcome. 
- Who's she? 
- Have you seen her before? 
Oh, hey, New Jersey? 
This one's empty. 
Thanks. 
- I'm Cheryl from Rhode Island. 
- Hi, I'm- - 
Gracie Lou Freebush. 
I memorized the orientation pamphlet. 
I know all 49 ladies by name and picture. 
Fifty, including myself. 
Your picture wasn't there, so I knew it was you from your lack of picture. 
How about a little song for the drive? 
I think you know the one I mean. 
From sea to shining sea 
Like Lady Liberty 
She reigns over all she sees 
She's beauty and she's grace 
She's Miss United States 
Entering Barbie-town. 
We're up and running. 
I love my job! 
- Not a bad view. 
- Not at all. 
There's our table! 
Ladies, I would like you to meet Gracie Lou Freebush from New Jersey. 
Karen Krantz, New York. 
What's up, Jersey? 
- Mary Jo Wright, Texas. 
- Hi there. 
Belinda Brown, Tennessee. 
- I like that! 
- Oh, yeah! 
Leslie Davis, California. 
Hey, girl. 
And Alana Krewson, Hawaii. 
Aloha. 
Aloha to you too! 
I want you all to know, I believe what it says on the sign at the Alamodome. 
We are all winners. 
Hey, Hart! 
You think she's hungry? 
Most important, we're getting our issues out there for people to hear. 
And it's an honor to have made it this far. 
Especially when you're from a small state- - 
That's so true! 
- Us Rhode Islanders- - 
- I wasn't finished. 
Did it sound like I was? 
I'm sorry. 
Why are you apologizing to her? 
She's been drinking too much Coppertone. 
- Are you talking to me? 
- Yeah, I am. 
Question : 
In Hawaii, don't you use" Aloha" for hello and goodbye? 
So? 
If you're on the phone with someone who won't stop talking and you say" aloha," don't they start again? 
At least she thinks I'm funny. 
Hart? 
Hart, do you copy? 
- What's up? 
- I don't know. 
It's not working. 
- It worked five minutes ago. 
- Who put it together? 
Check one, check one- - 
Thank you so much. 
Thank you. 
For the past 21 years it has been my honor to serve as director of this pageant. 
And I know that this year will be our most exciting event ever! 
Couple of geniuses I'm working with. 
After the rehearsal and a photo shoot, you can settle into your rooms. 
Tomorrow we will begin the preliminaries hosted by our master of ceremonies an American institution, Stan Fields. 
Thank you! 
Oh, thank you, Kathy! 
Let's go! 
Get it back online! 
- We're working on it. 
- We're trying. 
Thank you, Kathy. 
Isn't she ravishing? 
! 
How does she do it? 
I look in the mirror and say," Who's that old man in my pajamas?" 
And even though I'll be retiring this year.... 
Well, don't cry for me... 
Alabama. 
That's so sad. 
He's retiring. 
He's not retiring. 
I spoke to him this morning, and he blurted it out. 
They're firing him, going for someone newer and younger. 
I hope it's Ricky Martin. 
Jesus Christ! 
I'm sorry. 
I had a bite of my bagel and I forgot to pray. 
Dear Jesus, please forgive me for not praying before I had a bite of my bagel and schmeer. 
Thank you very much. 
Amen. 
I hope I'm not disturbing you. 
Oh, no, I was just, you know grooming. 
I made some of my famous hot chocolate. 
My roommate's asleep, or she's starting to mold. 
But do you want to come in? 
I asked some of the other girls but when they heard" chocolate" they slammed their doors. 
They didn't give me a chance to say" nonfat." 
Well, here's to world peace. 
World peace. 
Hot. 
I'm sorry. 
I have to tell you I thought it was really great how you settled that argument today. 
" Aloha, aloha." 
That's why you're gonna win. 
You're so clever. 
You should tell jokes for your talent. 
What is your talent? 
It's- - It's kind of like.... 
It's, you know, it's like a surprise. 
But don't worry, it's nothing embarrassing. 
Not anything like baton twirling or anything. 
So, what's your talent? 
Oh, Cheryl, I'm sorry. 
Twirling can be a real art. 
I saw this cheerleader doing it at a football game. 
She lit her batons on fire and did this sexy dance. 
I wish I could do something like that. 
Why can't you? 
My parents don't like anything ostentatious. 
And they really don't like fire. 
Cheryl, I think you have as good a chance as anyone to win. 
You believe in yourself to have gotten this far, right? 
- Really? 
- Yeah. 
You're so nice and so smart and so sensitive. 
You're definitely gonna win. 
That's it. 
Excuse me. 
I am in the middle of a REM cycle over here. 
- Sorry. 
- I'm sorry. 
Not happening. 
- What? 
- You took your earpiece out. 
- Vic needs you. 
- Now? 
- I haven't slept in two days! 
- I'll give you a cookie. 
It better be a big one. 
You don't walk, you float. 
Gently descending, you don't look down. 
Go back up and do it again. 
Never, ever look down, okay? 
Thighs touching.... 
- Touching, not clenching. 
- I'm touching. 
There's a gap between knees and calves, your calves and your ankles. 
Right now there's a huge gap between my brain and my spinal cord. 
Here. 
Take these. 
What, no armored car? 
That would be in my other dress. 
What are you planning to do for your talent? 
Sing? 
Dance? 
Chew with your mouth closed? 
I'll do whatever you want, Yoda. 
Oh, Lord. 
Agent Matthews! 
- This woman has no talent! 
- Don't shout it in front of her. 
I wasn't told to provide a talent. 
I can't do so in the next five hours! 
Wait a minute. 
What are you talking about? 
She'll be on-stage with nothing to do but convert oxygen into carbon dioxide! 
You said you couldn't make her pretty in two days, but she's gorgeous. 
Compared to the car wreck she was before. 
My duties are stated in a contract, and I have fulfilled them. 
- You talent her up by tomorrow or- - 
- Are you threatening me? 
- Listen to me, you old fruitcake! 
- How dare you, you cupcake! 
There's something I know how to do. 
I haven't done it since high school- - 
- You're not having sex on this stage. 
- I didn't know it was an option. 
This thing, I just have to call room service. 
Miss Hart. 
Please. 
Thank you. 
And the other one. 
Thank you. 
All right, all right, all right. 
Happy, you doughnut Nazi? 
Did I tell you Stan Fields was getting fired? 
I'm on it. 
You just concentrate on being Gracie Lou, all right. 
And by the way, you're doing a great job. 
I thought the evening gown looked.... 
- I totally bought it. 
- I know, you think I'm gorgeous. 
I don't think you're gorgeous. 
You think I'm gorgeous. 
You want to kiss me. 
You want to hug me- - 
McDonald's more feminine. 
I'd rather kiss him. 
- -Iove me. 
You want to hug me. 
You want to smooch me. 
Enjoy the rest of your night. 
Gracie, you look so tired. 
Oh, she had a busy night. 
I saw that gentleman stop by the room. 
Gentleman? 
- No men in the room. - It's different on the mainland. 
Hold on, ladies. 
Let's hear her side of the story. 
You sleeping with a judge? 
Oh, that guy? 
No, no, I was dating him for a little while because he said he had an incurable disease. 
I didn't realize it was stupidity. 
Oh, I know what that's like. 
He is such a pathetic loser. 
I'm sorry he's obsessed with me, but at some point it's like," Hello!" 
" Move on! 
Get over yourself!" 
His ego is this big. 
But his equipment is like this big! 
Good cover! 
We worked that out together. 
Use it for a needle. 
Back to work. 
Get ready for the Alamo. 
Thank you. Thank you. 
And welcome to the Miss United States Preliminary here at the beautiful and historical Alamo! 
Prepare for what promises to be a day of astounding musical, theatrical and dancing talent. 
And after I'm finished, you can see the ladies. 
Oh, yes! 
And now, put it together for Miss Mary Jo Wright from Texas! 
What's her talent, bartending? 
I made it very clear you weren't responsible for making her credible. 
I wish I could explain but there are no words. 
Eagle-Eye. 
You might want to check out cowboy at 1 : 00. 
My 1 : 00 or your 1 : 00? 
The one under the white Stetson. 
There's Stetsons everywhere. 
He's moving, he's moving. 
- Toward the stage. 
- Hold on, we're checking it out. 
Guys, he has a gun. 
He has a gun. 
Who's got the 20 on the shooter? 
I'm taking him out. 
Wait for a visual! 
Gun! Gun! 
Everybody down! 
Better up to them, don't you think? 
In a bizarre incident at the Miss United States Preliminaries the contestant from New Jersey leapt off-stage and tackled a man in the crowd who was trying to light a cigarette. 
She's here with me right now. 
What were you thinking when you jumped off the stage? 
All the contestants are actively involved in ending tobacco dependence. 
I think the gentleman will think twice before he lights up again. 
I'm sure we all will. 
- Look, he had a gun. 
- Of course. 
This is Texas, everyone has a gun. 
My florist has a gun. 
I don't have a gun. 
My ancestors were Quakers. 
Stan, please! 
We assume any man with a weapon is a suspect. 
We got the DNA results. 
The envelope from the Citizen was licked by a woman. 
There's never been DNA before. 
He slipped up, or I should say" she." 
This is preposterous. 
You people are completely clueless. 
If I ran my pageant like this, we'd be holding it in someone's basement! 
Every operation is bound to have its screwups. 
As far as I can see, she's still with us. 
Oh, God! 
Could I have a moment alone with Miss Hart, please? 
Sure. 
Just for a tiny minute. 
We'll just be a moment. 
Shop talk. 
Hair, gel, mousse. 
Look, I know I made a mistake. 
I'm sorry. 
I've been fighting all my life against your type. 
The ones who think we're a bunch of worthless airheads. 
You know who I mean. 
Feminists intellectuals ugly women. 
I refuse to give in to their cynicism. 
That's why I have dedicated my entire life to this scholarship. 
No one's going to ruin that. 
Not this year. 
You get in my way, I will kill you. 
Do you understand? 
Yeah. 
Yes. 
Frank! 
The interview is the single most important part of the pageant. 
It accounts for 30 % of your total score. 
What's the other 70 %, cleavage? 
Is this your idea of doing final preps on the convention center? 
Look. 
Liberace's got her in a nice evening gown. 
McDonald called. 
He saw Hart's anti - smoking commercial. 
He's on his way. 
Good, perfect. I'd hate for him to fire me over the phone. 
I can't believe this! 
It'll be ugly. 
No shit. 
I gotta do something. 
I'm gonna go do laps. 
We'll go over tomorrow's assignments. 
You got it. 
Hands folded... 
... ankles crossed. 
Neck up! 
And remember, smile. 
Smilers wear a crown, losers wear a frown. 
I would so love to hurt you right now. 
As long as you smile. 
Now.... 
Why is New Jersey called the Garden State? 
You can't fit" Oil and petrochemical refinery state" on a license plate? 
I don't appreciate your immaturity when I'm working as hard as I am. 
What's the big deal? 
It's fixed, I'm in the Top Five. 
Congratulations to me. 
Is that enough? 
Have you no pride in yourself, in your presentation? 
I'm an FBI agent, right? 
I'm not a performing monkey in heels. 
You're also a person, and an incomplete one at that! 
In place of friends and relationships, you have sarcasm and a gun. 
Oh, I have sarcasm? 
When every word that comes out of your mouth is dripping with disdain? 
That is because I am a miserable, grumpy elitist, and that works for me. 
I don't have relationships because I don't want them. 
And I don't have friends because I work 24-7. 
And you have no idea why I am the way that I am. 
As we're practicing interviews, why are you the way you are? 
None of your damn business. 
The judges probably have never heard that before. 
We have more to do here. 
No, we are finished. 
Finished? 
- Give me a 20 on Matthews. 
- Be advised he's at the pool. 
" How do you feel about gun control?" 
Favorable. 
Thought I'd let you know I was quitting. 
Take care. 
Hold on. 
Wait a minute. 
- What do you mean? 
- I mean, you got the wrong girl. 
All right? 
I do not need this now. 
That's what I'm saying! 
I'm totally screwing up in there! 
I don't feel like a real agent anymore. 
I mean, Vic says this thing that's so.... 
I don't care what he said, you know? I don't care. 
Because I am the job and I'm okay with that. 
Yeah, I'm the job. 
We're all the job. 
Then what's wrong with me? 
I date. 
I know everyone thinks I haven't had a date in 10 years. 
Is that what you think? 
I think you date. 
Damn right I do. 
But both times it was screwed up. 
All I want to do is my job. 
For the last three days I feel like I'm completely lost. 
I've been waiting five years to run my own op. 
- Would I blow it on the wrong girl? 
- You picked me because I looked good and wasn't on maternity leave. 
No, that's why they let me pick you. 
Know why? 
- Lost a bet. 
- You're smart and funny and you're easy to talk to when you're unarmed. 
Give yourself a break and cut Vic some slack. 
Because if they see what I see, then they'll love you. 
So, what do you say? 
I won't let you down. 
Good, that's what I want to hear. 
In all honesty, I might let you down. 
But I'll try my best not to. 
Do not mess with the dress. 
Oh, Vic is gonna kill you. 
You in big trouble. 
Why? 
You fell. 
- You look good wet. 
- Shut up! 
Whoa, guys, Hart's in the dressing room. 
Come on. 
- You see the legs on that girl? 
- Who's your daddy? 
Those better be candy dishes! 
Turn around. 
Open. 
This guy's like an inch from death! 
But what a way to go! 
- Break it up. 
Nothing to see. 
- What do you mean? 
She's a federal agent. 
Guess it's time to apply at my local Hooters. 
Hemorrhoid ointment? 
You think the judges will look that closely? 
It's for the baggies under your eyes. 
Really? 
Good, hair spray. 
Finally something I recognize. 
What are you doing? 
It stops the suit from riding up. 
Riding up where? 
Just up! 
That's enough! 
Why do you make things hard? 
I can see this is an incredibly embarrassing situation for you. 
Why does Georgia get to wear a one-piece and I have to wear this? 
! 
If you can do this, then you can convince anyone that you belong here. 
Places, everybody! 
Let's go! 
The Swimsuit Preliminary accounts for 15 % of the total score and tests the grace, athleticism and poise of each lovely woman. 
The last time I was naked in public, I came out of a uterus. 
I don't have breasts, my thighs- - I should wear a muumuu. 
I have avoided this experience all my life. 
And here it is. You must achieve a Zen-like state. 
Listen to your breathing, feel your heart think of the Dalai Lama. 
Texas! 
Rhode Island! 
New Jersey! 
Dalai Lama, Dalai Lama, Dalai Lama.... 
New York! 
California! 
I would have to say, world peace. 
Definitely, world peace. 
That's easy. 
World peace. 
World peace. 
What is the one most important thing our society needs? 
That would be harsher punishment for parole violators, Stan. 
And, world peace. 
Thank you, Gracie Lou. 
And thank you, Stan. 
Cheryl Frasier from Rhode Island. 
That was charming. 
Are you drunk? 
Glad you enjoyed it. 
Now excuse me, I have to go unscrew my smile. 
We got a lead. 
- The blood test? 
- Photos. 
Cheryl Frasier, with members of a radical animal rights group... 
-... involved in bombings. 
- It's always the quiet ones. 
She fits the profile : 
loner, introverted. 
That Cheryl? 
Describe your perfect date. 
That's a tough one. 
I'd have to say April 25th because it's not too hot, not too cold. 
All you need is a light jacket. 
Now, there is a hardened criminal. 
Maybe she's an accomplice. 
Maybe she's his inside connection. 
That's what you gotta find out. 
How? 
Buddy up to her, you know, girl talk. 
- Girl talk? 
- Yeah, girl talk. 
Sorry, I'm totally drawing a blank. 
Leg waxing, fake orgasms, the inability of men to commit. 
Why don't you talk to her? 
Imagine she's me and you want to know, but I don't want to talk about it. 
What would you do? 
You want me to beat her? 
Why don't you talk to her? 
Okay, forget about it. 
I will go. 
Put that back in your ear. 
I can't talk girl talk with a guy in my head. 
I can't even do it with me in my head. 
Girl talk. 
Oh, my God! 
Hey, Rhode Island, how you doing? 
How can you ask that? 
You heard my interview. 
I was like a female Rain Man. 
Oh, no, it definitely wasn't Rain Man. 
Definitely not Rain Man. 
Come and have a midnight snack with me and some girl talk. 
Are you crazy? 
We can't have pizza and beer! 
Do you know how many calories you're talking about? 
It's light beer and she's gonna throw it up anyway. 
Come on. 
Come with. No? 
No takers? 
No? 
All right, I'll just sit here. 
You guys go back on your bicycles and I'll sit here with my very large, cheesy pizza. 
Oh, look at all that cheese. 
Cheryl, don't. 
At least scrape off the toppings. 
First step, pizza. 
Second step, flaming batons.... 
I guess we'll be needing more pizza. 
I want another drink! 
We're gonna get a drink. 
Another round, ladies? 
- I can't do another one! 
- Yes, you can! 
This is so weird! 
This is my third one and I don't feel a thing! 
Really? 
Like when I did my interview question. 
Don't worry, we all sucked. 
You know, I had such a good answer to that question too. 
My idea of a perfect date would be a man who takes me to a romantic dinner. 
Then we walk along the beach barefoot, discussing books and music and movies! 
No wonder you're still a virgin. 
Time to paint. 
Come on. 
No, my contacts. 
- We'll stay here. 
- I want more pizza. 
We're gonna have more pizza and beer. 
Have fun! 
- This is so much fun. 
- Yeah, it's fun. 
It's so fun it should be illegal. 
Speaking of illegal, have you ever, like... 
Yes! 
Yes, I did. 
Go on. 
One time I stole red underwear from the department store. 
My mother wouldn't buy them! 
She said they were Satan's panties. 
- So is that it? 
- Yeah. 
Oh, there was this one thing in college with my Lit professor. 
One day I came to his office. 
He said he wanted to discuss a paper I wrote. 
He wanted to discuss a paper, right? 
Hey, can I get another one of these tubie things? 
Yeah, can we get another tubie? 
Anyway, he attacked me. 
Cheryl, did you report him? 
No, I never told anyone before this. 
I know that happens all the time. 
No, it doesn't! Cheryl, it doesn't. 
There are so many maneuvers that I could show you. 
Really? 
Yeah! Come on, get up. 
I want you to firmly plant your feet. 
I'm gonna move the chair. 
Now if someone comes at you- - 
She's completely trashed. 
We should get her back before Miss Morningside finds out. 
Kathy's got a boot up her ass about something. 
I don't think she ever got over those rumors. 
Come again? 
Her pageant years she was a runner-up. 
But then the winner mysteriously got food poisoning. 
Bizarro! 
No, Stan told me she got a letter a few weeks back from the network and they're firing her too! 
She threw a chair out the window! 
We gotta go. 
Come on. 
I got 20 people here waiting for confirmation. 
Don't tell me I don't understand. 
I hate when I don't see a wet paint sign. 
Stop it. 
Listen. 
- Can't hear you, took out my earpiece. 
- I have a lead and it's not Cheryl. 
Forget it. 
They bagged the Citizen. 
What? 
Where? 
It's confirmed. 
He was holing up in a shack in Nevada. 
Place had enough C4 to make a new Grand Canyon. 
Let's pack up and get out of here. 
Sir, I need to talk to you. 
One second of your time. 
Hear me out a second. 
I feel the situation bears further scrutiny and our continued presence. 
Do you have paint in your ears? 
We caught the guy! 
I respect what you're saying. 
I'd say the same to me but what if we were wrong? 
What if the Citizen didn't send it? 
What if it was a copycat? 
The letter didn't follow the normal pattern. 
The linguistic scheme was uncharacteristic and the DNA said it was a woman! 
Maybe he got his girlfriend to lick the envelope. 
I think we have reason to monitor Morningside. 
Why don't you jump on her dressed like a Bavarian fruitcake? 
You're the reason I had to drag myself down here and I don't want to hear anymore! 
You're absolutely right, sir. 
Not another damn word. 
Thank you. 
But she's getting fired this year, which she didn't tell us. 
You're already in enough trouble with the review board. 
Yeah, but when she was in the pageant, the only reason she won was because the winner got food poisoning. 
How bizarro is that? 
" Bizarro"? 
She threatened me. 
According to Mary Jo, she has a history of violence. 
Who is Mary Jo? 
Are you getting your information from a pajama party? 
Would you shut up? 
You're shutting up enough for both of us. 
Is there any reason to suspect Morningside? 
No, sir. 
There. 
I request permission to stay with a small contingent. 
Denied. 
Then I request permission to stay alone. 
You know what, I don't care what you do. 
You want to stay, stay! 
But as a private citizen. 
Turn in your badge and your gun. 
Everybody, I suggest we start packing. 
What? 
Don't look at me like I betrayed you. 
Betrayal implies action. 
You stood there. 
You got nothing to go on. 
I know everyone thinks I'm a screwup. 
But I feel like I'm in the right place at the right time. 
I have to protect those girls. 
It is my job. 
Part of it is following orders. 
The other part is using your brain. 
Throw out the rule book- - 
I like the book. 
I like knowing what I can and cannot do. 
You're not the only one who lives for the job. 
I want to keep mine for the next 20 or 30 years. 
Jesus, Hart. 
Give it a rest. 
Sure, give it a rest. 
What are you doing? 
Don't do it. 
Thank you. 
Thank you so much. 
I can't believe it! 
Hi, Mom. 
Don't do that! 
That slow, creepy thing in the shadows. 
Your father used to do that. 
Mom. 
This isn't gonna work. 
Why, of course it's going to work. 
The feds caught the Citizen. 
We have no one to pin it on! 
Okay, that was bad luck. 
But what about all these other letters from terrorist groups threatening us? 
" Women's Liberation Front." 
" Islamic Jihad." They're not so nuts about the Swimsuit Competition. 
Any one of these could have planted a bomb. 
When did we get those? 
I just finished writing them. 
Just like the Citizen letter. 
You're a genius. 
No, Frank. I'm just pissed off. 
Nobody fires me and gets away with it. 
They want a newer, hotter show they're gonna get it. 
Mom, you're a little scary. 
And you're a little bit sloppy. 
Tuck your shirt. 
I don't want to tell you again. 
Let's go home, honey. 
Mom? 
Oops. 
- Need a hand, boss? 
- I got it. 
Okay, Vic. 
Beautify me. 
Hair, makeup, shellac, whatever it is you do. That shiny stuff- - 
Where are you going? 
Your Agent McDonald insists that I depart, or I won't be compensated. 
No. 
After the Top 10! 
I am completely on my own. 
The FBI is gone, it's not fixed. 
I need you! 
Not anymore. 
The cocoon is open. 
I've taken a woman without a smidgen of estrogen and made her a lady. 
- Come on. 
- I've never been prouder of myself. 
Or of any girl I have ever coached. 
You are truly unique. 
If I ever had a daughter, I imagine that she would be something like you. 
Which is why I never reproduced. 
I have a really strong feeling something will happen to these girls. 
You need to stay for me. 
Please. 
I can't. 
But I can leave you this. 
I was saving it for tonight. 
It's your size, I believe. 
Good luck to you, Gracie Lou. 
It's been a privilege. 
No insults today? 
You're a Don Ho. 
Has anyone seen Gracie? 
I can't believe she missed dress rehearsal. 
Maybe she couldn't take the pressure. 
She ate four slices last night. 
We all saw her glasses performance. 
She is not making the Top 10! 
I overslept my beauty sleep. 
- Do you need help? 
- No, I'm fine. 
I wonder which one of these is lipstick. 
Ladies! 
Good luck, ladies! 
Keep it moving. 
Let's go! 
Looking good, ladies. 
Will you go back to the mothership? 
As long as you go with me, Tex-Ass. 
Let's go, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Texas.... 
I can't open the goddamn bottle. 
Have a good show. 
You guys excited? 
Where are you going? 
I forgot my breasts. 
Hold on, I'll be back. 
Going live. 
In five, four, three.... 
It's the 75th Annual Miss United States Pageant... 
... live from San Antonio, Texas! 
Good. 
That's the one I use at home. 
And your host for the evening, Stan Fields! 
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen! 
And welcome to a night of beauty, talent and poise. 
I'm not just talking about my cohost Kathy Morningside! 
- Hello, Kathy. 
- Stan, you charmer. 
But you forgot to mention" incredible intelligence." 
That was incredibly stupid of me. 
How can I make it up? 
By helping me to announce the Top 10 chosen based on their performance during the preliminaries this week. 
Here's the envelope. 
Thank you, Scott. 
Ladies, hold your breath. 
Hawaii! 
And we're following. 
Come in for that reaction. 
- Go to two. 
- Going to two. 
California! 
New York! 
Alaska! 
Texas! 
New Jersey! 
Oh, shit! 
That was graceful. 
That must have hurt. 
But she's up and at it. 
And last but not least, Rhode Island. 
And there they are! 
This year's Top 10 finalists. 
The Top 10 have been chosen. 
We'll be right back with tonight's Swimsuit Competition. 
I checked out Kathy Morningside. 
- Anything? 
- Not even a traffic ticket. 
Model citizen. 
Beauty contestant, pageant director, loving mom. 
- She's married? 
- Widow. 
One son. 
A sniveling, obsequious weasel of a human being. 
- You know her son? 
- So do you. 
It's Frank. 
- Her assistant? 
- Asshole Frank? 
One and the same. 
She never mentioned anything. 
Anything come up on the CCH? 
Nothing on Frank Tobin. 
There wouldn't be. 
His name is Morningside. 
He changed it to cover his many indiscretions. 
Wait. 
How do you know that? 
I've been around this pageant for many years. 
I could shock you with the intimate details I'm privy to. 
Good job! 
Good job 
I got you something. 
I couldn't- - 
You ate pizza, you stole panties, you're wild. 
We worked on this, remember? 
You're gonna be great. 
- Can I see your ticket? 
- Federal officer. 
I'm with him. 
Gentlemen, you can't go in- - 
Victor! 
He's with me. 
Wait. 
I'm not" with him" with him. 
Come on, muffin. 
Thank you! She certainly lit my fire. 
Now you can wear Satan's panties! 
- Hey, Hart. 
- What are you doing here? 
I think you might have been right. 
Frank is Kathy Morningside's son. 
Disgusting, perverted Frank? 
He cleared under another name. 
DUI, assault, even a weapons charge. 
Are we doing full deployment? 
McDonald didn't want to hear about it. 
It's just us. 
Good show, Mr. Tobin. 
You're up next, New Jersey. 
I gotta get my glasses. 
Hey! You're drinking my talent! 
You got to make it into the Top Five! 
- Can you whistle? 
- No! 
- Make hand puppets? 
- No! 
I had a girl who rearranged furniture. 
That and a right hook. 
And now, the musical stylings of Gracie Lou Freebush. 
Good evening. 
The program says I'm supposed to play the water glasses for you but the girls got dehydrated. 
No water glasses? 
You want me to go to a commercial? 
No, stay on her. 
Go with it. 
I believe no woman should be without a basic knowledge of self-defense. 
So in order to show you this, I'm gonna need a little help. 
I would like to bring out my assistant, Eric Bob. 
More changes? 
Follow her. 
Stay on her. 
- -how to inflict damage with the least amount offorce. 
In some cases, your attacker might come at you in a frontal assault. 
Use the heel of your hand and thrust. 
This will cause the nose to break and your assailant's eyes to tear giving you a chance to get away. 
All right. 
Let's say your assailant comes at you from behind. 
Attack me! 
Little Eric looks a little scared. 
Maybe he needs a little applause. 
She's kicking his ass! 
You were the best queen ever. 
Thank you, that is so sweet. 
Ladies, give Lori some room to breathe. 
Go on, now. 
You need some powder. 
You don't have to hold the crown all night. 
My God, that is disgraceful. 
Frank! 
Take this to the prop master. 
See if you can't get it to shine. 
If all else fails, go for the four sensitive areas of the body. 
But just remember to" sing." 
S-I-N-G. 
Solar plexus, Instep Nose, Groin! 
Sing. 
Cue Stan. 
Welcome to the Garden State! 
When we return, we'll find out who those lucky Final Five are. 
Let's go find Frank. 
Take left. 
I'll take this side. 
No. 
Evening gown, now. 
Ladies! 
In one moment, five of you will be one step closer to the crown. 
And one of those five is California! 
Leslie Williams is a music major. 
She believes in the healing power of music. 
Loves opera, reggae and, like any true California girl, the Beach Boys. 
Rhode Island! 
Cheryl Frasier is a science major. 
Her field is nuclear fission with a minor in elementary particles. 
Nebraska! 
For Kelly Beth Kelly, all the world is a stage. 
A theater major she helps run a drama program for underprivileged children. 
New Jersey! 
Gracie Lou Freebush hopes to become a pediatrician. 
Gracie, it's you. 
Go! 
Her hobbies include figure skating, water ballet and taking long, luxurious bubble baths. 
You go, Gracie Lou. 
And our fifth finalist : 
Texas! 
Mary Jo Wright is a psychology major. 
In her spare time, she works in a homeless shelter and eats Mexican food. 
Thank you, ladies. 
You were magnificent. 
I want all the lesbians to know if I can make it to the Top 10, so can you! 
Big out to Brooklyn! Yo! 
Get her off of there! 
Go to Stan! 
Tina, I love you, baby! 
I love you, Karen! 
And we'll be right back with our final five lesbians. Interviews. 
Bumper. 
Commercial. Can we say" lesbians"? 
You got a problem with that? 
In a way, America is like a big ship. 
When we work together and respect each other that's when the ship gets safely home. 
Terrific answer. 
Damn it. 
New Jersey. 
As you may know, there are many who consider the Miss United States pageant to be outdated and antifeminist. 
What would you say to them? 
Oh, my God. 
I would have to say, I used to be one of them. 
And then I came here and I realized that these women are smart, terrific people who are just trying to make a difference in the world. 
We've become really good friends. 
I know we all secretly hope the other one will trip and fall on her face- - 
Wait a minute! 
I've already done that! 
For me, this experience has been one of the most rewarding and liberating experiences of my life. 
My God. 
I did it. 
And if anyone anyone tries to hurt one of my new friends I would take them out. 
I would make them suffer so much, they'd wish they were never born. 
And if they ran, I would hunt them down. 
Thank you, Kathy. 
A brief, shining moment, and then that mouth. 
Helps if you pull it out. 
Good luck, ladies. 
I wanted to rub the crown for luck. 
Frank took it to get it polished. 
I'll have it by the time they announce the winner. 
My God! 
It's the crown! 
Yes, it is. 
You can taste it now- - 
No, no, no! 
Not the- 
- This in the- - 
Finale positions. 
Yes. 
Wear the crown. 
Be the crown. 
You are the crown. 
And now, the moment of truth and beauty. 
The envelope, please. 
What? 
A lot of tension. 
The fourth runner-up is California! 
The third runner-up is Nebraska! 
- Am I in danger here? 
- Wait here. 
The second runner-up is Texas! 
Drop it! 
I mean it! Drop it! 
This is it. 
The moment. 
One of these two ladies will wear the crown. 
Listen to me! 
I'm gonna reach for my badge slow. 
You do, and you're dead. 
The first runner-up who will have to take the winner's place if, for any reason she cannot fulfill her duties is : 
New Jersey! 
Which means our new Miss United States is : 
Don't take the crown. 
Rhode Island's Cheryl Frasier! 
Don't take the crown. 
Trust me. 
She's beauty and she's grace 
She's queen of 50 states She's elegance and taste 
She's Miss United States 
Hold your crown up high 
Raise it to the sky 
Jersey's gone berserk! 
Get her off the stage! 
Hold your crown up high 
Raise it to the sky 
She stands for all that's good 
She loves her neighborhood 
She's friends with everyone she meets 
She's beauty and she's grace 
She's queen of 50 states 
She's elegance and taste 
She's Miss United States 
Gracie! 
She's Miss United States. 
Okay. 
Good show, everybody. 
I was right in the middle of my song! 
You got nothing on me. 
This is ridiculous. 
Where you're going, they'd love to meet a former beauty queen. 
When he says meet, he means M-E-A-T. 
Miss Hart, you don't understand. 
All I'm guilty of is trying to make the world a more beautiful place. 
Look at yourself. 
When I met you, Dennis Rodman looked better in a dress. 
But now you're a lady! 
I did that. 
Vic did that, and a team of highly specialized federal manicurists and people who make you beautiful. 
Get in the car. 
You think you saved something. 
All you did was to destroy the dream of young women all over the country. 
Their dream is to get blown up? 
You got a good shot at that insanity plea. 
I earned it! 
Years of bitching beauty queens and what do I get? 
Fired! 
They steal my life, they steal my beauty pageant. 
It is not a beauty pageant. 
It is a scholarship program. 
Yeah, yeah. 
" Yes." 
Enjoy running the Miss San Antonio Women's Correctional Facility Pageant! 
Get it? 
The Women's Correctional- - 
That was good work. 
Right back at you. 
So, how does it feel? 
Throwing the rule book out of the window? 
Pretty good, actually. 
I was thinking when we get back after we write up our reports and you get all ugly again maybe we could have dinner? 
What? 
You asking me out on a date? 
No. 
Just a casual dinner. 
If we happen to have sex afterwards, so be it. 
You think I'm gorgeous. 
You want to date me love me and marry me. 
A part of you is gonna miss this. 
The heels. 
They do something for my posture. 
I'm suddenly very aware and proud of my breasts. 
- Funny, me too. 
- Agent Matthews! 
Gracie! 
Thank God you're still here. 
There's been an emergency. 
Somebody found some sort of incendiary device. 
Come on, quickly! 
Excuse me. FBI. 
She saved the pageant, she saved our lives, and here she is! 
That's not gonna work for me. 
I can't go up there! 
It was his idea, Gracie Lou. 
I'd never get you here unless you could shoot someone. 
You'll get yours, Henry Higgins. 
Come on! 
Ladies and gentlemen, agent Gracie Hart of the FBI! 
Not so fast! 
Because even though you're a federal officer to us, you will always be Gracie Lou Freebush. 
The nicest, sweetest, coolest girl at the pageant and this year's Miss Congeniality! 
I don't know what to say. 
Except for I can't wear this at work. 
I never thought anything like this would happen to me. 
I kind of hoped it wouldn't. 
But now that it has I just want to say that I'm very very honored. 
And moved. 
And truly touched. 
And I really do want world peace. 
Mary! Look at dirty again! 
Let your workers to do it for you! 
What's the difference, Joanna? 
Look at this, it's oil. 
Mother! 
Son, you're better than that! 
Where you've put your hands? 
That Mary always does it! 
I know... but Mary knows what's she's doing. 
It's alright. 
Amos! 
Amos! 
Amos! 
Get out of my sight! 
Amos, where are you going? 
Wait! 
Why're you treating me so badly? 
What I've done? 
Tell me! 
All right. If you must know... 
I divorce you. 
Why? 
Come on Mary, you're a stubborn, insolent, a dirty peasant. 
I am a simple woman, but I love you. 
That's not enough. 
I want children, I want an heir. 
You're as bearer as the desert sand! 
It will come, with the Lord's blessing. 
Your womb is cursed. 
You heal others. Heal yourself! 
Witch! You're possessed with demons! 
Not fit to stay in my house. 
This is my house. 
Matellus was my father's land. 
Remember the promises as you made him. 
He was dying. 
How could he know he was selling me rotting goods. 
You can't mean that... 
The scriber will be here to prepare the rite. 
Pack your things, and prepare to leave! 
You won't throw me out that easily. 
I was born here. 
This land was my dowry. 
Paid to me with a marriage contract. 
It's mine! I've made it bloom. 
And now it's mine. 
Magdala will soon have a new mistress. 
Now I understand. 
He robs me of my home to remarry! 
I need a son. 
What honest wife doesn't desire an heir for her husband? 
If I must leave my house, where do I go? 
I pitty this woman. 
I should not abandon her. 
The deeds, to my farmer, Telazor, as long as you stay there, living modestly, and chastely, you'll receive his rents and dues. 
Your birth place. 
A pig stable for mine! 
Ungrateful. 
You're ungrateful. 
The rite will be served tomorrow. 
You will regret this, how ever long it takes. 
You'll see Mary, you'll make a new life for yourself in Telazor. 
What life! ? 
Here I was the mistress of the house. 
Down there I will be less than a servant! 
But you are still the same woman. 
You still know how to take care of the land. 
And you can heal people. 
You know how to make that desert bloom like a garden. 
And it'll become your home. 
Mother! 
Silvanus! 
Mary! 
Magdala's is beautiful as ever. 
We're long march ahead with no provisions, 
So we've to swallow Amos' prices. 
Help yourself. 
Free? 
For the night your soldiers can stay by the river. 
I'll have a bed prepared for you. 
Since when you've been so welcome into Romans? 
These are my last orders as mistress of the house. 
I'm leaving Magdala. 
Amos has divorced me. 
Impossible! Why? 
Welcome Silvanus. 
Amos. 
A business call? 
Yes. The usual terms. 
We're staying. 
Set up camp. 
Move on. 
Hurry up! 
Mary, what's crossed your mind? 
He'll do. He's looked at me once or twice. 
Lord forbid! 
The Lord? 
And where is He in all of this? 
No, Mary. Don't blaspheme. 
Please don't throw your life away. 
Trust in the Lord. 
I want revenge. 
Mary. 
The law is on his side. 
Our law. 
It's barbaric. 
In Rome, we have marriage contracts. 
Women have property rights. 
But Rome never comes between a man and his wife. 
Why shouldn't Roman law apply? 
Could I appeal to the Emperor? 
Are you a Roman citizen? 
Well that's a shame. 
I've served my time here. 
I'm going back to Rome. 
I was hoping that... 
What were you hoping? 
That you'd help me and... 
And let you get your revenge. 
You're a clever woman. 
I wanted you since the first time I saw you. 
Mary, here's the divorce scroll. 
Too late. 
I'm leaving you. 
That's what you wanted, isn't it? 
I wouldn't friend. 
They'll make a mess on you. 
What is it Amos? 
You're afraid? 
Joanna! 
I hate the see you failed so low. 
Why? Just because I found a man who wants me? 
Goodbye, Samil. 
Take care of yourself. 
Out! 
Out of my sight, whore, whore! 
Keep your tongue, Amos! Or I will tear it out! 
Forward, march! 
Let's go. 
Silvanus, the Jordan! 
This isn't the way to Rome. 
Last tour of duty, I'm sure you don't mind. 
What are they looking for? Where're they going? 
That's what we're going to find out. 
Why do we have it. 
Do you know him? 
No, but I heard about him. 
What is he doing? 
He's preaching. 
He's a rebel. 
No, He's telling them to search their souls. 
Who? Those peasants? 
Get down. 
What else is he doing now? 
He's baptizing them. 
What do you know about these things, Mary? 
I'm a Jew too. 
Then you'll help me. 
Silvanus, Prefect of Rome, wants to talk to you. 
He sent you to me? 
Yes. 
But I came because I wanted to. 
Because you're in danger. 
Why? 
The Romans fear a revolt. 
They don't know that you're only a preacher. 
And you've come to save me? 
Just tell me what I must answer them, and they will leave you alone. 
I can tell you that you are not happy with him. 
That's not what they want to hear. 
But it is what you want to hear. 
I did not choose this life. 
My name is John, son of Zechariah. 
Why do not you stay here and pray with us? 
Thank you. 
I've different plans. 
With the Roman? 
He's rich and powerful. 
Many of the people you see here, had wealth once. 
But they're looking for something more. 
Here they found it. 
Stay with us. 
If you like. 
I have what I want. 
Well? A zealot? 
No, he's a talker. 
Fomenting revolt, is giving them ideas. 
He's a mystic. 
Harden, but harmless. 
Then why does he draws such crowds? 
Who? The cripple, the blind, the sick. 
All hoping for a miracle. 
I'll tell you what he is... a charlatan! 
No...! 
He just happens to believe in what he preaches. 
Don't you ever lie to me, Mary. 
Ever. Remember that. 
Marcelus, put me some more wine. 
What's wrong with you? 
Are you pregnant? 
I think so. 
I thought you're barren, or was it just a lie, to trap me! 
No, I thought so, too! 
I suffered for years, thinking, I'd never be a mother. 
That's the reason, why Amos divorced me. 
Then come back to him with his child! 
No, it's yours. How can you tell? 
What kind of a fool you take me for. 
But I don't really care what you're going to do with your bastard. 
We're going! Let's go. 
Tiberius. 
Herod Antipas' new city's named after our emperor. 
Why you don't cheer up, or I shall send you back to Magdala. 
Noble Vitalius, our faithful ally, and friend of our emperor. 
Allow me to convey the heartfelt esteem, to tell you of, the great favor he's showed me... by the grace of the emperor Tiberius, my new queen. 
A shame she's his brother's wife. 
Who's that? 
That my dear, is his present wife : 
Princess of Nabathea. 
An audience! The ambassador of Nabathea, demands an audience. 
Declares it's an outrage, to his daughter, your wife. 
He's divorcing a princess? Why not? 
What wife? 
The daughter of king Arethas, Lord of Nabathea, your allies. 
I've forgotten. 
My master, King Arethas, will hear of this. 
And... may took him! 
Poor woman. 
She too is nothing but a possession! 
Come down! 
Silvanus! 
Don't move. 
The general has seen us. 
Wait here! 
And don't call any trouble. 
I am not your slave, Silvanus. 
Who is she? 
She's only a Jewish whore. 
When the ceremony is over, you will give me an explanation. 
What's wrong? Go away! 
I'm not well. 
If you want, I can give you a herb tea, for the pain. 
Give me something, so I never have this again! 
It's painful, I know, but soon you'll get used to it. 
You will fall in love, you'll have a husband, and children then. 
I don't want to. 
Why? 
I don't want to become like her! 
Is she your mother? 
- Yes, but hate her! 
I don't want to be here! 
I want my real father! 
My name is Salome. Who are you? 
Mary! 
I told you! 
Witch! 
" Only a mystic is he"! 
So why's Harod Antipas thinking he's dangerous! 
You're lying to me, don't you! 
And now they're questioning me, and want to know, why I'm on duty with a Jewish whore! 
You thought I was your free passage to Rome, didn't you? 
You don't know what your place is, woman! 
That's your trouble! 
I'll show you where you place is. 
I'm done. 
She's yours. 
Help me! Hurry! 
What is it? 
She's ill. 
Help me. 
You can stay here. 
You need to rest now. 
The baby... my baby. 
You've lost him. 
But life goes on. You'll have others. 
A good catch, master. You chose the right side. 
What's this? 
- A woman! She's drown! 
Master, she's still alive. 
" Ashna"," Ashna"! We won't hurt you! 
She's possessed! 
There're demons in her. 
Can you help her master? 
Can you cast them out? 
Leave her be. 
Please, let her be, please... 
Don't be afraid. We're here to help you. 
You heard the commandment : 
Don't commit adultery! 
But I say : a man who lust for another woman, has already committed adultery in his heart. 
It's been said : whoever wishes to part with his wife, must serve her with a divorce rite. 
But I say : a man who divorces his wife, forces her to commit adultery. 
It's been said : 
love your neighbour, and hate your enemy. 
But I say : 
love your enemies, and pray for those who hurt you. 
For if you love only those who love you, what is your reward. 
Make way! 
Master, come quickly! 
My daughter is dying, please! 
Please, my mistress is asking for you. 
You believe him? 
Yes. 
All men lie. 
What makes him different? 
You saved your life. 
What do you want from me? 
Come. 
You're the woman the Nazareene saved? Yes. 
What's your name? 
Mary. 
Why did he saved you? 
I don't know. 
Can he really heal the sick without medicines? 
Don't be afraid. 
Your slave think so. 
Ah, she's a simple creature. 
Superstition is her daily bread. 
And what about you? 
Isn't that why you came here, to see him? 
Could you cure this? 
I sent my servant after him, but he didn't come. 
He cures the poor it seems. 
A queen is beyond his powers. 
What is it? 
Leprosy? 
No. What then? 
I must heal before Herod notices. 
The king's never seen this? 
In the darkness, men see what they wish to see. 
And women must always deceive, there's no other way. 
Would you, cure me? 
If you trust me. 
If you succeed in healing me, I give you all the riches and power a woman can desire. 
Prophets, medical men, don't mix with them. 
The Nazarene claims, to be of the House of David! 
And raises the death! 
- Raises the death? 
It's ridiculous. 
A rabbi's daughter. 
Then arrest him, milord. Silence him. 
If it only were that easy, in this land of believers, then I... 
Then what? 
Tell me, my love. 
Tell me your thoughts, your desires.... 
Oh, a newcomer? 
I'm feeling better. 
Who is this? 
She's my sibyl, Salome's tutor. 
Such gentle fingers. 
Where you ever in love? 
In another life. 
Married? 
Once. 
But you lost him. 
He'll pay for it, one day. 
Oh, you hate men so much? 
You're not ugly, 
Not old... 
Well! Do your work with her! 
Come here. 
Let me have a closer look. 
Pretend I'm a man. 
No. 
That's completely wrong. 
You must never give in too easily. 
It's fatal. 
And now I say : 
You're so beautiful, Mary. 
But you know you're beautiful, don't you? 
So, you turn away. Walk. 
No. A woman never runs. 
She glides. 
That's better. 
Don't look back. 
That only gives you away. 
A man, must always think he's the one making the first move. 
You see? 
Now, I'm following you. 
Your husband, Herod Antipas, is coming. 
Quick! 
He's got the Roman with him. 
Vitalius? Why? 
Noble Vitalius, please. 
The general has come to take his leave. 
War against Pathiei, Rome's eternal enemy, has broken out again. 
My compliments, noble lady. 
I pitty your enemies, general. 
They've been beaten from the start. 
It is not so simple. 
Have you heard the latest news? What news? 
Pamaretus, king of the Nabatheans, to the emperor Tiberius... 
He demands redress for the affront of his daughter, or, he will go to war. 
A few barbarian nomads. 
How could they hope to obtain victory against Rome? 
Most noble lady, if the Nabatheans ally with the Partians, the situation will become difficult for all of us. 
Let's send the general off, with something more cheerful. 
Salome, would you dance for us? No! 
No? 
Forgive her, General. 
The girl isn't well. 
And who are you? 
Her duty is to protect Salome. 
A duty she does well. 
Then the dancing must wait my return. 
Yes. 
How dare you, slave! 
Dance when you're told to! 
But I didn't want to dance! 
She lied! 
And just as well that she lied! 
Well, my sybil... maybe you talk too much, but you know how to please. 
That's what you taught me. 
In me, he sees you, Vitalius. 
Then Herod shall obligue. 
Come. 
You see? 
A keep it for special guests. 
I was rich once. 
You were? 
And you shall be again. 
Love is power, Mary. 
You must learn to use it. 
Let men love you, but never, never love them. 
That's the first rule. 
But... 
- But what? 
Love is a luxury. It's denied to women. 
But, powerful men despise women who are too plain and simple, my dear. 
You need a servant now. 
I'll give you my best. 
Suzanne. 
Vitalius, is the greatest man in the entire province. 
Win him to me, and you name your price. 
You don't have to do this. 
I know what I'm doing. 
I'm not made to serve. 
My father was a prince. 
Oh, and mine was king. 
But now I am a slave. 
I was not easy for me at first. 
But then, I met the Master, and He set me free. 
You can choose too. 
Choose wisely. 
It's John. 
They've arrested him. 
John! 
Wait! 
Have you found what you were seeking? 
I have a new life here. 
Honor, respect... 
Is that what you wanted? 
Mary, Mary! 
Is it, really you? 
What are you doing here? 
Your husband... 
I have no husband! 
Amos, supplies Herod Antipas from the stores at Magdala. 
Magdala... 
I've forgotten the sound of that name. 
We miss you, especially Samuel. 
Has Amos taken a new wife? 
- Yes. 
Does he have children? 
- No. 
But you should stop thinking about that. 
You've done well here, Mary. 
Look at you. Are you happy with your life now? 
Yes, I am happy with this life, but the Mary you knew, is dead. 
If only the past would really die. 
- I can't bear to see your destroy like this, Mary. 
Believe me. 
The Lord can comfort you. 
All I can do is to accept my damnation, and get used to it. 
Mary. Mary! 
You promised you'd cure me, right? 
So, how much longer? 
Not long now. 
Trust me. 
Be careful, Mary! 
Or you will be sorry! 
As the only reason you're here! Don't forget it. 
Have you ever really cured someone? 
And what about me, then? 
How much longer must I hide? 
Why must you hide? 
Your husband loves you. 
Ah... loves me... 
A man who doesn't know how to govern, too weak to fight, too stubborn to obey... 
No, no. 
He will divorce me. 
He's playing some game behind my back, calling Vitalius from the war. 
He's holding a bank within his honor, why? 
No, no. 
He will divorce me. 
I can feel it! 
He'll have his former wife back, to save his neck. 
The Nabatheans want revenge. 
But Rome and Vitalius are on our side. 
Rome is a whore. She beds with the highest bidder. 
Save me, Mary. Save me. 
Help me! 
I don't want to lose, what I've conquered. 
Why must we wait? 
Where's the king? 
It seems I no longer interested you, Vitalius. 
What's wrong? 
Have I lost all my charms? 
Forgive me, my lady. 
My men are still in the battlefield, which Harod Antipas forced me to abandon! 
But this is a feast, General. 
Mary. 
Take care of our General. 
I'd like to know how, you intend to take care of me. 
It depends, General. 
I want you. 
Tonight. 
Taking the body of a woman is not a difficult task. 
Anyone can do that. 
And what is, a difficult task? 
Taking her thoughts, her heart... 
Hmm, a most enticing challenge. 
We welcome you, Lucius Vitalius, offspring of the goddess Vitalia. 
And we welcome to our feast the second guest of honor, who has come from Babylon. 
The Ambassador, of Parthia. 
Embrace each other. 
Enemies, no more. 
Peace! 
Poor Nabatheans. 
Herod Antipas that old fox. 
Pinch the potential ally right from under their noses. 
So you don't have rebels, here in Galilee? 
Those are false rumors, Vitalius. 
Then it's not true, that you have an agitator in your prisons? 
He's only a charlatan. 
I, would like to be the judge of that, or are you keeping secrets from Rome? 
Surely not. 
And we can use some amusement. 
A toast. 
Let's drink to the gods of peace. 
It was a farce. 
Herod made a fool of me. 
He made me believe we're at war with the Partians, only to prove to Rome that he could keep peace! 
Tiberius must be informed immediately. 
I'll reach Rome by the fastest route. General. 
We're going! 
You did not hear any of this. 
So you're beaten by Herod. 
All Rome will make fun of you. 
Unless he never reach his destination. 
What do you mean? 
Someone must pay, and who'll be the one to be sacrificed? 
The messenger. 
John! So my dear Vitalius, here he is. 
You see? 
He's harmless. 
And this little man makes so much noise? 
He's only a clown. 
A windbag. 
Let's hear him. 
You're here on charges of sedition. 
- Treason! 
What do you have to say? 
War. 
Too late! 
We've just made peace. 
Can you hear? 
The Nabatheans march on Galilee? 
Who of them will be sitting at your table? 
The Romans, the Parthians, or even your whores? 
On that day Herod, you're alone. 
And all for what? 
For passion, that never was? 
You sent away your rightful wife. 
You affront your neighbors. 
You take your brother's wife to your bed. 
But soon your land lies burned. 
Your people enslaved, and yourself, in exile, with your concubine. 
How dare you? 
And you Herodias, for dream of kingship, you turned your child into a bastard. 
Abuse motherhood! 
You're completely mad. You're lying! 
Repent. 
Be cleansed! 
Return to your real husband. 
I forbid you to speak! 
Or where will those end. 
If not in the blood, of Israel. 
Take me away! 
I've spoken. 
Take him away! 
Kill him! 
You think you're the Messiah? 
I baptize with water, for the remission of sins... but someone is amongst us, who is mightier than I, whose sandals, I'm not good enough, to untie. 
He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and with fire! 
You were right, Herod. 
Tiberius would find it funny too. 
Noble Vitalius, my name is Amos. 
In my city of Magdala, we're building new bars. 
Would you put your names on them? 
Will see. Perhaps. 
Vitalius? 
- Yes? 
I'll let you know. 
Magdala. You know it? 
Then you decide. 
Who's that? 
He's a traitor, and a thief. 
Really? 
- Yes. 
Rome doesn't like traitors. 
I'll find a way to let him know that. 
Are you satisfied? 
You've satisfied my every desire. 
I ask no more. 
Do you know why fate brought me here? 
Because they say you're a witch. 
You have the magic spells that make men fall in love. 
I've demons in me, they come when I call. 
And when they're gone, what's left? 
I do not know. 
You'll have to find out. 
I want to find out. 
One demon... 
Two demons... 
Three demons... 
You've bewitched me. 
I just one you to love me. 
It's war or peace? 
My master sends word : 
Restore his daughter to your throne, or Nabathea will bring war to Galilee. 
We've done everything and more. 
You won't see us again. 
And good ridance. 
War... Will it ever end. 
If Herod does what they say... 
And if he doesn't? What will you do? 
Wait... 
and see who's winning. 
- Call my generals! 
I'm at stake, may I leave... 
Duty calls. 
Would you come back, if I need you? 
Even if it were from the very edge of the Empire. 
My king. 
Vitalius! 
What's this? 
Get the horses ready. 
Do something! 
What's happening? 
He's deserting us! 
So you didn't succeed in making him stay? 
He will come, if I call. 
Wait, Mary. I put were you are. 
Don't you remember. 
If Vitalius doesn't come back, your days are numbered. 
Suzanne prepare to leave. 
Mary, pack your things. You're coming with us! 
Salome! 
Salome! 
Come away. 
Come! 
And John? 
- You needn't to bother about it. 
He won't be a problem for us much longer. 
He's more use to you alive. 
Then change his mind, and I'll set him free. 
Come! 
No. 
Why? 
Mary! 
Why are you still here? 
We're coming to, to take care of supplies. 
War is no place for a child. 
Where is Amos? 
He left, before they gave the alarm. 
I'll have you replaced. 
But you're going with them, aren't you? 
I'm forced too. 
This time I won't let you go alone. 
Mary, we are almost ready to leave. 
You can wait for him all day, but I don't think he'll come. 
I know. 
You've given your heart to the wrong man again. 
It's not what you think. 
Mary, Mary look. 
It's Jesus! 
Blessed is the man, who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers. 
Sees delights... 
- Stop! 
Stop here! Stop him! 
Stop him! 
I can't stand it anymore! 
Do something! He's getting on my nerves! 
He's expecting a rescuer. 
His accomplice, the Nazarene, is out there. 
Attack him! We we have the troops? 
And leave an insurrection behind us? 
We have to do something. 
Mary, go. 
Try to shut him up. 
You must be thirsty. 
Not as thirsty as you. 
How long will you deny yourself? 
What do you know about me? 
A fallen woman, divorced, deserted... 
You know what pain is. 
What ties you to Herodias? 
A marriage-breaker... 
Riches? 
Power? But what do you want? 
A man. 
And perhaps his love. 
Is that what you want? 
I've done eveything to reach this. 
It's still isn't enough for you? 
What do you really want? 
What do you desire most? 
Mary. 
I want to love, and to be loved. 
But the love of a man, so easily gets lost. 
A love that is deeper, one that brings peace, a love of God. 
And where is this love? 
In pain, in war, in the misery of the world? 
God hides Himself from us, so we find Him through longing. 
In the end, no matter what the questions is, He is, the only answer. 
I came here to help you, but I can't. 
Wait... to beggars, my disciples, would you go with them, to Jesus, to bring him a message? 
Ask him : 
Are you the Messiah, or must we wait still? 
I thought you knew. 
Every life has its purpose. 
Mine is, to prepare the way for Him. 
Even if that should cost you everything? 
Yes. 
So? - He wants me to carry a message to the Nazarene. 
What message? 
- Does it matter! 
He trusts Mary, and she will bring him the answer, he wants him to hear. 
And now send for Vitalius. 
Please Mary, take me with you. 
I must go with you. 
I can't stay here knowing that you were with Him. 
Listen Mary, I wouldn't coming back with you. 
You must. 
The fate of runaway slaves, is death. 
There is no place for that, where he stands. 
Now. 
Tell John that the blind can see, the lame can walk, the lepers are healed, deaf can hear, and the dead arised. 
Go and tell him that. 
When you walk into the woods... 
- No other message? ... looking for John... what do you expect to find? 
A prophet? 
Yes, and you found one, more than a prophet... 
For this is the man to whom it was written : 
I send my messenger before your face, to prepare the way before you. 
For I truly tell you, of those born of a woman, none is greater that John the Baptist. 
And then he said :" The smallest in the Kingdom of Heaven, is greater than you." 
I have my answer. 
It is Him! 
And now? 
I must fall, so He may rise. 
Repent, Mary. 
Forgive. 
Before it's too late. 
Well? 
It's hard to understand these men. 
But there's one thing, I do know. 
They can't be bought. 
You must kill them, Antipas. Both of them. 
They're dangerous. 
They're undermining us. 
The soldiers won't fight. 
What are you waiting for! 
The troops would think you believe them! 
Enough! 
Give the order, now! 
The Nabateans. How long until we'd have to fight them! 
How long until until supplies ran out! 
And our allies? Where are they! 
Where is Vitalius? 
Enough! 
I am the king. 
I decide. 
Joanna! 
- Mary! 
Joanna! 
What will happen now? 
You can't stay here anymore. 
It's too dangerous. 
I'll send you back to Magdala, if we survive. 
You must kill him. 
Kill him! 
Look, the Nabateans are cowards! 
They're running. 
They're running! 
Vitalius! 
I'm so glad to see you! 
May the gods reward you, General. 
My apologies for the delay. 
I discovered a traitor in the ranks. 
Your message never reached Rome. 
You mean Tiberius knows nothing of the peace with the Parthians? 
- No. 
But Rome punishes disobedience. 
Here's the proof. 
A feast, for our guests, help, banquet! 
What have I done? - Prepare a banquet for our guest of honor... 
Silvanus. 
- Quick, don't make our General wait! 
Aren't you glad, I came back for you? 
Yes... but Silvanus... 
Silvanus, Silvanus! 
What do you care about Silvanus? 
Silvanus is dead. 
I knew him. 
And so? 
Mary... Who are you? 
I don't know anything about you. 
Who am I? 
A woman who wanted revenge, and lost... 
lost herself. 
Until you found me. 
It's over, Mary. It's over. 
I love you. 
For the might and glory of Rome! 
To our noble allies. 
We'll see about that. 
You meant to desert Herod Antipas? 
Why do you think I'm here? 
For this buffoon! 
And the war, the Nabateans? 
... 
Say" stay", and we should fight. 
Say" go", and we should leave them. 
The fate of Galilee depends on me? 
My fate. - Some entertainment! 
Music, dancers! 
In this hole? 
Salome. 
Salome, my sweetest daughter. 
Would you dance for us? P-please...? 
No. 
Of course. 
Of course! Salome will be happy to dance for you. 
Conquer the king for me, and I will give you the husband you desire. 
Come! 
They finally have persuaded her to dance. 
Dance, now! 
Tell me your reward, up to half a kingdom... 
Ask for the head of John the Baptist. 
The head of John the Baptist! 
Salome! 
Be quiet, slave! 
I want you to give me, on this platter, the head of John the Baptist. 
Nooo! 
Mary! 
Will you break your promise? 
Insult your guests? 
Give them an order! 
Yes or no. 
Show you're a king. 
Yes. I am king. 
Do as she says. 
No. No! 
Forgiveness. 
Mary! No hatred... no revenge... 
I'm here. 
I danced... 
I danced for Herod as my mother wanted! Yes, Salome. 
She promised me a husband. 
Leave her alone. Leave her alone. 
Didn't you hear what I said! Mary! 
I said leave her alone! 
After all this time, you've learned nothing from me, Mary. 
That's not true. 
I've learned something. 
I've learned cruelty, and hatred for all! 
But I'm not like you. 
I'm not heartless like you are! 
How dare you! Leave her! 
Let her go! 
The only reason I keep you alive, is that Vitalius finds you bearable. 
John is dead, but his word lives on. 
Our soldiers will be in Magdala in a short time, General. 
- Good. 
What did you say about Magdala? 
Tomorrow, Magdala would not longer exist. 
What? 
I told you. It's over. 
I've sent soldiers. 
They'll destroy it. 
No, no! Mary, what's wrong? 
Amos, the traitor, will not hurt you again. 
That's not what I wanted! 
Please take me there, before it's too late. 
Please. 
Let's go. Soldiers! 
- The Emperor will hear of this! 
Go, go! You'll see! 
You're nothing, Mary, nothing! 
You'll spend the rest of your life, warming the bed of the entire Roman legion! 
My compliments, General. 
You've got what you deserve! 
A whore. A whore! 
You're abandoning us. But... I'm king. 
Joanna! 
- Mary, Mary! 
Joanna! 
... Mary! 
Help me, Samuel's in the house. 
I think he's not breathing. 
He's dying! 
He's dying! 
Do something! Oh, Mary, do something! 
Come back Samuel! ... 
I could not save him. 
Turn your back on Galilee. 
There is life elsewhere. 
Not for me... 
to be the cause of so much pain. 
It's done! 
Accept it! 
How? 
I would be anywhere else, not to be here, not to be who I am... 
No one can help me. 
Who can forgive me now? 
How can she forgive me? 
I killed her son. 
Take hard, Mary. 
Death ends all things. 
No. 
Rome needs me, Mary. Come with me! 
Nobody, nobody will hurt you again. 
I know I can make you happy. 
The love of a man, your love, was all I ever wanted... 
That means you don't love me? 
I do love you. 
I no longer know what I want. 
Can I help you? 
Come with me. 
I' m asking you for the last time. 
Mary. 
I hope you find what you're looking for. 
Mary! Mary! 
I found you at last. 
Look, Jesus is here. 
Please, Mary, come with us. 
I can't face him. 
You don't have to be afraid of him, Mary. 
He... He is the answer! 
Mary, Mary. 
Don't touch me. 
I'm unclean. You called me. 
Come. 
Joanna. 
Leave him now. 
Come. 
Samuel... 
Get up now... 
Your mother is waiting... 
Yes. 
Samuel, Samuel! 
Mother! 
Mother! 
Mary. 
You see, love is stronger than death, and every sin... 
Welcome, welcome. 
Thank you for accepting my invitation. 
We've been waiting for you. 
I thank you for your invitation, Simon. 
I can't. I don't deserve his love. 
It's not true. 
Jesus accepts everyone. 
Let Him into your heart. 
Come, Master. 
How dare she enter. She's a prostitute! 
Come. 
Rabin... 
They're wondering, how you can be a prophet, I mean, not to know what kind of woman she is... 
I know what kind of woman she is... 
She's a sinner... 
Simon, I have something to say to you... 
You see this woman? 
I entered your house, and you gave me no water for my feet... but she's washed them with her tears. 
and wiped them with her hair... 
You did not greet me with a kiss, but yet, she hasn't stopped kissing me... 
You did not anoint my head with oil, but yet, she's anointed my feet. 
So I say to you : her sins are forgiven, as her love deserves. 
Your faith has saved you. 
You're forgiven... For you've loved so much... 
Go in peace... 
I won't leave You, ever... 
I will follow You, wherever You go... 
And so, I followed Him, to the cross... 
Then I met him alive, risen, and finally, I understood. 
His love was stronger than death... 
That's what He showed me, and I trusted Him... 
Where's Jesus gone, Mary? 
He hasn't gone. 
We're living His love... 
He lives on, in the love we're giving to each other... 
I'm just happy to be getting off the ship. 
We got the place for the whole weekend, that's the good thing. 
You finished already, Granato? 
You're getting better at this. 
Whatever. Do you think I could put this gear away now? 
Absolutely. 
There's plenty of deck for you to swab. 
Haven't I done enough, 
- Petty Officer Rowe? 
- No. 
You've got three hours and 12 minutes left on your watch. 
Oh, forget it. 
Stow the Brasso and swab the deck, Seaman Granato. That's an order. 
Do it now, Granato. 
Do it yourself. 
- Look what you did. 
- I quit. 
- You can't just quit the Navy. 
- Watch me. 
Good evening, and thank you for coming. 
Every time the Navy unveils a new recruiting commercial, we all have a stake in it. 
But tonight, for those of us at JAG, stakes are even greater because the commercial stars our own Commander Harmon Rabb. 
With the commander tonight is the director of the commercial, Renee Peterson. 
I understand she's still trying to stop him from ad-libbing. 
Let's all now take a look and see how the nation's gonna see us this week for the first time. 
I'm Commander Harmon Rabb. 
The Navy has given me not one, but two careers. 
The first you've just seen, flying F - 14 Tomcats. 
The second I'm working at right now, as a lawyer in the Judge Advocate General Corps. 
The great thing about the Navy is the challenges don't stop with courtrooms and jets. 
You could work in nuclear propulsion or computer electronics. 
Or you could stand tall with the world's elite fighting force, the SEALs. 
So if you think the Navy is for you, take my advice. 
Step up and meet the challenge. 
- Very good, sir. 
- Very professional. 
- Nice job, commander. 
- Thank you, sir. 
You know, I was under the impression that Miss Peterson was going to use... 
Your line, sir, was edited out. 
Renee will explain it to you. She's right over there. 
If I'm not mistaken, commander, the only thing those three women have in common is you. 
Did you see what she was wearing? 
I can't believe he's dating that girl. 
- Good morning, lieutenant. 
- Good morning, sir. 
We can discuss it later, colonel. 
Commander. 
- I scare her off? 
- She's a little high-strung. 
Listen, colonel, on another note, what were you and Bobbi Latham talking to Renee about last night? 
Just girl talk. 
Admiral's waiting. 
Nice to see Commander Rabb could step out of the spotlight long enough to join us. 
First order of business is Andrea Granato. 
Apparently decided she had enough of the Navy and walked off her ship, the USS Hartung. 
Witnesses said her parting words were," I quit." 
Didn't anyone explain that quitting wasn't an option when Seaman Granato enlisted, sir? 
Apparently, Generation X only worries about itself. 
This sounds like a simple case of unauthorized absence, sir. 
Why is JAG involved? 
Because Seaman Granato is being charged with dereliction of duty, missing ship's movement and, as a result of 47 days of absence, desertion. 
Ouch, sir. 
Ouch is what you get when you walk off a Spruance-class destroyer getting ready to deploy to the Adriatic. 
The skipper drops a ton of bricks on you. 
- Up to prosecuting, colonel? 
- Absolutely, sir. 
- Commander, you will defend. 
- Yes, sir. 
Admiral, I'd like to volunteer to assist Commander Rabb. 
Oh, I don't think that will be necessary, lieutenant. 
- My plate's clear, sir. 
- Well, then let me fill it. 
It seems a young petty officer took a car from the motor pool at Bethesda Naval Hospital and got caught drag racing. 
You'll be handling his special court-martial. 
Yes, sir. 
- So that does it unless- - 
- One more thing, sir. 
These bricks that Seaman Granato's CO is dropping on her, why so many? 
I'd been hearing about Seaman Granato's attitude since her first day aboard. 
From her leading chiefs in CIC, mostly. 
What sorts of things were you hearing, Commander Woodling? 
- She's a whiner. 
- Not the first one in the service. 
Did you whine when you were working toward those silver oak leaves on your collar? 
- I couldn't afford to. 
- No woman in the military can. 
You know it and I know it. 
And Seaman Granato just failed to get the message. 
But her records don't show any previous instances of trouble. 
She was near the top of her class at boot camp. 
Well, that ceased to matter when she walked off this ship and missed the berth switch the next morning. 
Is this personal, commander? 
Stereotypes are the curse of every woman in the military. 
After what I went through... 
Well, I don't have to tell you about discrimination, now, do I, colonel? 
- I'm not the issue here, commander. 
- Oh, no, you're wrong. 
We both are. 
And you'd better understand that if you wanna successfully prosecute this case. 
I never pictured you working behind a desk. 
Not after seeing how much you hated it those two months in Saigon. 
Well, hell, I found one that fit. 
Besides, I'm not like you damn aviators. 
- I don't suffer from oxygen deprivation. 
- Sir. 
Hell of a lot better than lack of action. 
I haven't missed a war since Vietnam. 
All right, all right. 
Quit patting your damn chest and tell me why the hell you called me out here. 
I need your help, admiral. 
I had a little problem with an aircraft. 
I got my ass grounded. 
My FNAEB is in a couple of days, and if I don't win it, it could mean no flying, no command. 
Sounds like more than just a little problem. 
I ran off the end of a damn taxiway. 
Got stuck in the mud. 
I foddered the engine when I tried to power out. 
- What the hell happened? 
- My eyes. 
- Are they that bad? 
- No, they're fine. 
But the flight physical found something in my bloodstream, screwed up my vision. 
I couldn't tell the taxiway lights from the runway approach lights. 
Well, what do you mean, something? 
Viagra. 
Oh, hell, Pete. 
I told you the problem wasn't my eyes. 
You know the rule. 
You can't take Viagra and fly. 
The FAA says six hours is enough to get it out of your system. 
That's a civilian rule. 
Admiral, I thought it would be enough. 
Let me see what I can do. 
I really did wanna be in the Navy, sir. 
Well, some people are gonna have a hard time believing that, 
Seaman Granato. 
Including you, commander? 
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. 
I am your lawyer, after all. 
Yes, sir. 
I thought it would be a good way to better myself. 
The Navy, I mean. 
The kind of scores you got on your ASVABs, college would have been an option too. 
Too expensive, sir. 
Bu then I was hearing about the Navy, you know. 
And I thought," Wow, where else am I gonna get a chance like that?" 
What kind of chance were you looking for? 
The recruiter told me that I could be an air traffic controller, sir. 
Oh, interested in aviation, huh? 
Totally, sir. 
I'd never been in a plane before I was flown to boot camp. 
That was cool. 
Not the pilot part, but the getting it back down on the ground. 
Whenever I was flying, getting back on the ground was always important. 
- What did you fly, sir? 
- F-14s. 
You can't be my lawyer, sir. 
Excuse me? 
I saw your television commercial last night. 
You're just another recruiter. 
- I've already had one lie to me. 
- What lie? 
The lie they told me about how I could be an air traffic controller, sir. 
- Like that's ever gonna happen. 
- Go on, I'm listening. 
First they told me that my school was postponed, so they send me to fleet as an undesignated striker. 
Then three months later, they tell me that they are over-quota'd on air traffic controllers. 
They offered me some other schools, but they were not what they promised me. 
Well, I'm sure it wasn't personal, Seaman Granato. 
These things happen in the military. 
But nobody told me that, sir. 
If you can't get your head around that, then you should not be defending me. 
I don't know what to tell you, Chief Pearson. 
Maybe I am backing away, sort of. 
That's what I just- - 
- Commander. 
- As you were, chief. 
Thank you, sir. 
Look, Ronnie, if you want to go to college, put in your four years and the Navy will pay your way. 
And by that time, you'll probably have a lot better idea about what you- - 
You're Commander Rabb. 
That's him. He's in our new recruiting commercial too. 
On TV. You seen it, Ronnie? 
I don't remember. 
When you do, you will definitely wanna play on the commander's team. 
Yeah. 
Okay, Chief Pearson. 
- All right, think Navy, Ronnie. 
- Sure. 
I had him locked in. 
Then his mother offers him 500 bucks to go to a community college. 
Economy like it is, I usually hear them saying they found a job that pays better than we do. 
Yeah. 
Sounds like tough duty, chief. 
Oh, at least they lowered my quota, sir. 
Now if I sign three kids every two months, I'm a hero. 
A year ago, they wanted four a month. 
I was going nuts. 
That would be about when you signed Andrea Granato, wouldn't it? 
Oh, yes, sir, it was. 
A total homerun that girl. 
Is she working for you? 
I'm her lawyer, chief. 
- She's been charged with desertion. 
- Andrea? 
Claims she did it because she didn't get the school you promised her. 
Did you guarantee she'd be an air traffic controller, chief? 
I didn't guarantee anything, sir. 
Neither do college football recruiters, chief, but they sometimes wind up with two quarterbacks both guaranteed to start. 
Commander, I never made her a promise the Navy couldn't keep. 
You just told me you were up against a wall back then, chief. 
- You had to sign four a month. 
- That's right, sir. 
So I talked faster, worked harder. 
Bought myself a great-Iooking SUV to keep recruits from thinking the Navy is as butt ugly as this office. 
Are you taking new recruits for a ride, chief? 
Only in my car, sir. 
JAG Ops, Gunnery Sergeant Galindez. 
Gunny, have you seen Lieutenant Singer? 
Yes, sir. 
I just picked her up on my radar. 
Lieutenant Singer? Telephone, ma'am. 
It's Commander Rabb. 
I'll take it at your desk, gunny. 
Yes, sir? 
Lieutenant, I've got my hands full here in Baltimore. 
I was wondering if you could find time to help me out. 
On the Granato case, sir? 
- It would be an honour. 
- Great. 
Granato's recruiter's name is Chief Roger Pearson. 
I need you to find out if there is any evidence that he has trouble telling the truth on the job. 
I'm sure his unhappy recruits would tell you that, sir. 
I need better than unhappy, lieutenant. 
I need lied to. 
- Yes, sir. I'll get right on it. 
- Thank you. 
- Gunny? 
- Yes, ma'am? 
I need a favour. 
- Colonel MacKenzie? 
- What is it, Bud? 
Well, you're busy with your case. 
I'll come back later. 
No, no, no. It's not a problem. 
Let's talk in my office. 
It's Harriet, ma'am. 
Do you think she's still mad at me about Australia? 
No, Australia is ancient history, Bud. 
Besides, Harriet's not the type to hold a grudge. 
Well, last night, I asked her what was for dinner, and she made me sleep on the couch. 
Enter. 
- Congresswoman Latham. 
- I was just visiting the admiral, and while I was there, I thought we could chat. 
By all means. 
We'll talk later, colonel. 
What happened to your jaw, lieutenant? 
Oh, Commander Rabb punched me. 
Oh, Commander Brumby too. 
It was an accident. 
Ma'am. 
- Please. 
- Someday, I'd like to hear that story. 
But right now, I'm more interested in the Granato case. 
Well, the court-martial starts tomorrow. 
- So the charges remain the same? 
- Yes, ma'am, they do. 
Colonel MacKenzie, doesn't this strike you as a prime example of using an axe to peel a grape? 
I didn't know you had a personal interest in the case. 
Well, I'm making arrangements for Seaman Granato to testify before my subcommittee. 
On national security? 
On the retention of women in the military. 
We lose a third of them every three years. 
- A statistic I assume would alarm you. 
- I'm well aware of that. 
But the kind of women who should be in the military don't desert because they're pouting over the school they didn't get. 
They wouldn't pout if they were given accommodations. 
Accommodations? 
I think you've got this thing backwards, Congresswoman Latham. 
Women, like men, are in the military to serve our country. 
Not vice versa. 
Nobody's serving anybody if the Navy recruits women and then chases them away. 
Andrea Granato wasn't chased, she ran. 
From what, colonel? 
- Hi. 
- Hello. 
Doctor Walden, Doctor Sidney Walden? 
That's right. It's an old family name. 
You're not the first to expect my grandfather. 
So, Admiral Chegwidden, how can I help you? 
Well, actually, I'm here about a friend. 
Admiral, there is no shame in erectile dysfunction. 
Doctor Walden, I am the judge advocate general of the United States Navy. 
And as such, I think I possess enough respect for the truth to be forthcoming if I had a problem, which I don't. 
Not that I've lately, but the... 
I know what you mean, admiral. 
Work doesn't leave much time for relationships. 
Kind of ironic for me, I guess. 
- Is this your son? 
- Yes. 
My husband died almost 12 years ago. 
Danny plays lacrosse for Maryland. 
Just a freshman. 
Listen, I hope I wasn't too strident. 
I... 
It's refreshing to meet someone who doesn't mince words. 
Now, about your friend. 
Oh, yeah. 
Right, right. 
Well, he's a Naval aviator. 
Flew after taking Viagra. 
Foolish maybe, but it wasn't an issue until he had a mishap. 
No fatalities. 
- But the Navy is touchy about it. 
- Right. 
I know the common wisdom about the drug is that it decreases the ability to distinguish blue from green. 
Exactly. 
The colour of the lights on the taxiway where the accident happened. 
Look, have your friend come in, admiral. 
I'll examine him and we can determine exactly what the drug does to his sight. 
Well, I don't know if he's gonna be comfortable with that. 
Even if it gave him a defence? 
Andrea's sisters, her brother. 
We were all excited she was gonna be working with airplanes. 
The whole block was. 
But I guess she never got close to an airplane, did she, Commander Rabb? 
- No, ma'am, I'm afraid she didn't. 
- Oh, that recruiter. 
He filled her head with all kinds of jets and fancy uniforms. 
You know, glamorous stuff she was never gonna get if she stayed around here. 
Did you hear the recruiter promise or guarantee anything? 
I never met him. 
Too busy working here. 
Plus, I thought Andrea- - She was 19 then. 
- -She could make her own decisions. 
Sounds like you have a lot of faith in Andrea. 
Nothing but, commander. 
She was great in school. 
She took care of my other kids after her father passed and I had to be out of the house so much. 
Did Andrea ever have an attitude problem, Mrs. Granato? 
Oh, well, she could be a little bossy. 
But other than that, she was like a second mother. 
Did she tell you that she was planning on leaving the ship? 
I didn't even know she was unhappy. 
She wrote to me, everything was swell. 
But when she got home, it all came out. 
Big improvement over premieres and hijackings, huh? 
It is, isn't it? 
You sound surprised. 
Well, I just haven't had many evenings like this recently. 
Well, things can change, Harm. 
I think I'm looking at a very interesting future. 
Whoa, it's a little early for predictions, huh? 
You're not very good at relationships, are you? 
I just don't think we should be getting ahead of ourselves. 
Oh, no, no, no. 
Harm. 
- No, you don't understand. 
- I think I understand. 
You said that you think there's an interesting future and- - 
No, no. It's a movie, Harm. 
The budget's only about two and a half million, but it's a really great opportunity. 
What's the movie about? 
It's actually about loneliness. 
Love triumphs? 
Well, not in the script that I read, but they had a really great time along the way. 
- Really? 
- Really. 
- A really good time? 
- Really good. 
Is everybody getting court-martialled this nervous, sir? 
- Comes with the territory, I guess. 
- Commander. 
Just who I was looking for. 
An addendum to our witness list. 
Paul Skowron? 
- Ask your client. 
- He's a guy I know. 
More like the boyfriend she deserted the Navy to be with. 
Boyfriend just slip your mind, Seaman Granato? 
I didn't think he mattered, sir. 
Well, you better believe he matters if he's the reason you left that ship. 
No, commander. 
Everything I told you is the truth about my recruiter lying to me, promising me things that were never gonna happen. 
How long after you left the ship did you go to your boyfriend's house? 
Right away, sir, but it's not what you're thinking. 
Enlighten me. 
I didn't have anywhere else to go. 
How many days did you stay at Paul Skowron's? 
Three days, sir. 
Four days, sir. 
And in those four days she spent at your apartment, Mr. Skowron, did Seaman Granato talk about the problems 
- she was having with the Navy? 
- She said she couldn't deal with it. 
Anything about a recruiter? 
Anything about broken promises? 
We actually didn't do a whole lot of talking. 
I see. 
So while Seaman Granato was at your house, she was just enjoying your company. 
Yeah, I knew she'd been hearing from her friends that I was seeing other girls, so I figured she wanted to try and get us back together. 
- Because she was jealous? 
- I think so, yeah. 
Jealous enough to desert from the Navy? 
Objection, this calls for the witness to be a mind reader. 
- Sustained. 
- No further questions. 
Mr. Skowron, prior to these four days that Seaman Granato spent with you in March, when was the last time you saw her? 
I don't know. 
Maybe nine, ten months ago. 
Which would be before Seaman Granato entered the Navy, correct? 
I guess. 
Had she been back to Baltimore in this time? 
I think so. I heard she was. 
- She didn't see you then? 
- No. 
So since she lived with you for four days in March, has she moved back in with you? 
- No, she's staying with her mother. 
- So, what you're saying is, is that she treated your apartment like a hotel, only cheaper. 
- Objection. 
- Sustained. 
We are still seeing each other. 
- Every week? 
- Sometimes. 
- Are you engaged, Mr. Skowron? 
- No. 
So really, what you and Seaman Granato have is a casual social relationship. 
I suppose so, yes. 
Thank you. 
She dropped her Brasso, ma'am, splashed it all over my trousers. 
And then she walked right over the brow. 
Without permission, Petty Officer Rowe? 
I couldn't believe it, ma'am. 
You don't just quit the Navy. 
Did you have any other reaction? 
Oh, yes, ma'am. Anger. 
We were preparing to deploy, loading gear, testing systems, working like plough horses. 
Seaman Granato couldn't have picked a worse time to jump ship. 
Thank you. No further questions. 
So you were understaffed. 
You were preparing to deploy. 
Checking systems, loading gear. 
And you couldn't find anything better for Seaman Granato to do than to polish brass? 
It's a part of Navy life, sir. 
Like swabbing the deck. 
Which is exactly what you had ordered 
- Seaman Granato to do next, isn't it? 
- Yes, sir. 
Were you singling Seaman Granato out for drudgework, Petty Officer Rowe? 
I wanted to make a point, sir, that she needed to apply herself. 
Was that the point? 
Or was the point that Seaman Granato is a woman? 
No, sir. 
Yeah, got it. 
I owe you one. Thanks. 
Lieutenant Singer. 
I checked around like you asked. 
- Found somebody interesting. 
- Let's take a look. Isaac Crawford. 
He lives in Pikesville, in case you need him as a witness. 
Good, good. 
Commander Rabb. 
I found someone you can use to counter Granato's recruiter. 
And he lives in Maryland, so it will be easy to call him as a witness. 
Nice work, lieutenant. That was fast. 
- Thank you, sir. 
- Let's take a look. 
- Can I help you with that, Sims? 
- You don't want the admiral catching you with a messy desk, gunny. 
I thought she was just bringing me my lunch. 
She's been like this for days. 
Isn't there a drawer we can put these in? 
So the good news is this lady doctor could maybe prove 
- that Viagra didn't affect my eyesight? 
- Right. 
Which leaves only one other explanation. 
That I'm a half-assed aviator who should be kept away from planes for the rest of his natural life. 
So we're back to square one. 
I'll plead ignorance. 
Ignorance does not become a base commander. 
- Especially at a FNAEB. 
- I know. 
I really did think that stuff would be out of my system by the time I flew. 
Pete, the rule is clear. 
Is there a rule that says I can't have a happy marriage too? 
That is not the issue here. 
You mean we're just Naval officers, nothing else, right, admiral? 
When it comes to that board, you bet. 
I'm not making it very easy for you to be a character witness, am I? 
Well, it's not me I'm worried about. 
Two days after Seaman Granato deserted, we began tactical testing in preparation for deployment to the Adriatic. 
We had general quarters drills, fired all of our weapons, did everything we could possibly do to achieve combat readiness. 
Should Seaman Granato have been there, commander? 
Oh, without question, colonel. 
Her absence simply made life that much harder for everybody else. 
Thank you. 
Commander, how did the Hartung perform in its TAC tests? 
We scored 97 percent or better on every one. 
I was very proud of my crew. 
The ones who chose to stay. 
So then you are fully prepared to deploy next week, correct? 
Yes, we are, commander. 
Then Seaman Granato's absence did not affect your combat readiness. 
Well, that's no excuse for what she did. 
Commander, isn't what she did generally punished with a lesser charge than desertion? 
- Objection. Relevance? 
- I'll allow it. 
Overruled. 
I don't know what's generally done, commander. 
I assume you know what is specifically done aboard your ship, then. 
How many absence offences have you sent to courts-martial in the past year? 
- Two or three. 
- Maybe this list will jog your memory. 
There were four. 
For three men prosecuted for unauthorized absence. 
One woman, Seaman Andrea Granato, prosecuted for desertion. 
Her timing was worse. 
Her attitude was worse. 
And her sex was worse too, wasn't it, commander? 
Are you using Seaman Granato to prove that a woman CO can be as tough as any man, commander? 
No, I am not. 
Are you trying to weed out somebody who doesn't meet your standards of what a Navy woman should be? 
They're not my standards, commander. 
Whose standards are they, commander? 
The Navy men who might use a woman like Seaman Granato against a woman like you? 
- Objection. 
- That's enough, commander. 
I have no further questions, Your Honour. 
Let me get this straight. 
A woman commanding officer is a male chauvinist pig? 
Mac, you know she's doing exactly what I said she is. 
What I know is that your client jumped ship. 
Harm. 
I thought you had a meeting about the movie. 
Got cancelled. 
Well, don't get me wrong, I'm glad to see you. 
Well, you shouldn't be. 
Colonel MacKenzie here called me as a witness. 
Now, what could Renee possibly have to do with this? 
She fits into my case. 
- Really? 
- Yeah. 
Would she fit into your case if she wasn't my girlfriend? 
Do you think I'd let your social life dictate my trial strategy? 
How would you like it if I called Brumby as a witness? 
How soon can you get him here? 
Anything you'd like to share with the court, 
Col. MacKenzie? 
Commander Rabb? 
- No, sir. 
- No, sir. 
Then call your first witness, commander. 
Was it difficult to convince 
Andrea Granato to enlist, Chief Pearson? 
No, sir. 
She was very positive about the Navy. 
- Very enthusiastic. 
- So you didn't have to mislead her about anything that might happen to her in the Navy? 
- I don't do that, sir. 
- Really? 
Do you recall recruiting Isaac Crawford, chief? 
- You convinced Mr. Crawford to enlist back in June of 1998. 
He was honourably discharged eight months later because the Navy failed to honour a contract containing promises you made him. 
That was an unusual case, sir. 
What promises did you make Andrea Granato, Chief Pearson? 
I told her there was an excellent chance she'd become a flight controller, sir. 
You didn't know that there was a chance she wouldn't become a flight controller? 
I didn't know the school was almost over-quota'd, sir. 
Did you explain to Andrea Granato that something like this might happen? 
I didn't tell her any lies, sir, but a recruiter stresses what's likely to go right, not what might go wrong. 
Admiral Hodges, members of the panel. 
In the 31 years that I have known him, 
Captain Peter Tully has always been a consummate warrior. 
He has flown combat missions in every conflict this nation has faced, from Vietnam to Bosnia. 
You need only look at his chest to understand this is a man who has never taken a backwards step in the face of danger. 
I'm proud to call him a friend. 
I am honoured to call him a fellow Naval officer. 
Admiral Chegwidden, you say that knowing that Captain Tully violated a general order from the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. 
The Judge Advocate General's office must not be as unbending as I've always thought. 
We're not talking about a crime here, admiral. 
He took a normal 50-milligram dose a full 21 hours before he flew. 
Almost four times the waiting period required of civilian pilots. 
And now his career hangs in balance. 
A career, gentlemen, I believe, does not deserve to end on such a note. 
Thank you, Admiral Chegwidden. 
Captain Tully. 
You stand here today because you put yourself before the Navy and thereby risked your career, your life, 
- and conceivably the lives of others. 
- Yes, sir. 
But as Admiral Chegwidden said, your record should count for more than a single foolish mistake. 
It will, however, do so only once. 
Come this way again, captain, you'd better strap yourself in for a court-martial. 
- Dismissed. 
- Aye aye, sir. 
Admiral, I owe you one. 
Why don't you come to dinner with me and Mary Anne? 
Bring a date, if you're seeing someone. 
With my workload? 
I'll give you a call. 
All I wanted was to be an air traffic controller, sir. 
And that is what you were led to believe you'd be trained as? 
Yes, sir, by my recruiter, Chief Petty Officer Pearson. 
And then school got delayed, and then there were too many people. 
And then I was just out of luck. 
- Is this why you left the Hartung? 
- No, that was not the reason. 
Then why, Seaman Granato? 
Because they acted like they didn't need me, sir, the way that my recruiter said that they did. 
Thank you. 
Seaman Granato, isn't it true that the Navy offered you other schools when Air Traffic Controller School 
- was no longer available? 
- Yes, ma'am. 
Do you recall what those schools were for? 
- No, ma'am, not really. 
- Let me refresh your memory. 
Cryptology, information systems, aviation electronics. 
But they weren't in my contract, ma'am. 
Do you mean this contract, Seaman Granato? 
- Yes, ma'am. 
- Is that your signature? 
That is my signature. 
It said I could go to Air Traffic Controller School, ma'am. 
- You read the contract carefully? 
- Yes, ma'am. 
I'm sure you recall this sentence. 
" Scheduling of the above school is subject to the needs of the Navy." 
- No, ma'am, I don't. 
- Are you sure? 
Because it's very important upon entering the Navy that you realise its needs come before yours. 
I'm sorry, colonel, but I do not remember that. 
It was there for you to read, wasn't it? 
It was in your hands. You signed it. 
Yes, but Chief Pearson should have said something. 
Why is that, Seaman Granato? 
Was he the one enlisting? 
No, ma'am, I was. 
No further questions. 
Redirect, Your Honour. 
Seaman Granato, you were 19 
- when you enlisted, correct? 
- Yes, sir. 
Had you signed many contracts at this point? 
- No, sir. 
- None? 
None, sir. 
In light of this fact, did Chief Pearson encourage you to read the fine print in this contract? 
No, sir. 
- The defence rests, Your Honour. 
- Colonel, any rebuttal? 
Yes, Your Honour. 
I'd like to call Renee Peterson. 
Your Honour, may we approach? 
Sir, Miss Peterson is not an appropriate witness. 
She certainly is, Your Honour. 
She is an expert on recruiting. 
She directed a commercial that Commander Rabb himself starred in. 
- I've seen it. 
- That hardly makes her an expert. 
Sir, this is a blatant attempt to put the focus on me. 
Embarrassed by your performance, commander? 
No, sir. 
Did you think his performance was embarrassing, colonel? 
- Absolutely not, Your Honour. 
- Then we agree. 
Miss Peterson may testify. 
I've shot a dozen or so rock videos and two documentaries, and people were impressed. 
- Navy people. 
- Why the Navy, Miss Peterson? 
My edge, my honesty, my reputation for independence. 
Did your reputation remain intact when you made your commercial for the Navy? 
- Yes. 
- Did you write the script 
- for your commercial, Miss Peterson? 
- Yes, based on my research. 
Were you ever instructed by anyone from the Navy to sugarcoat your subject? 
I don't operate that way, colonel. 
The Navy wanted to present a fair picture of itself to recruits. 
- And that's what I gave them. 
- Thank you. 
Your witness, commander. 
Miss Peterson. 
How many people did you interview at JAG in your preparation for the commercial? 
Four : 
Admiral A.J. Chegwidden, Lieutenant Bud Roberts, 
Petty Officer Jason Tiner and you. 
But they didn't end up in your commercial, did they? 
No. 
Why? 
You can start with Admiral Chegwidden. 
He... 
He was a little stiff. 
Lieutenant Roberts? 
His work in the Navy wasn't very interesting. 
You actually shot some film with Petty Officer Tiner, didn't you? 
- Yes. 
- But you didn't use it, why? 
Because all he could talk about was his filing system. 
- It bored me out of my skull. 
- So you picked me. 
You weren't boring. 
I wasn't a typical JAG lawyer? 
No, you flew Tomcats. 
Doesn't this contradict your earlier testimony, Miss Peterson? 
You said that you gave potential recruits an honest depiction of Navy life. 
- Objection, argumentative. 
- Overruled. 
Miss Peterson, did putting me in your commercial faithfully represent the Navy as you saw it? 
It was a commercial. 
Commercials are made to sell. 
You show the best. 
I thought you were the best. 
I made a mistake. 
No further questions. 
You may step down, Miss Peterson. 
- I request a recess, Your Honour. 
- Fifteen minutes. 
Renee... 
It's my job. 
- To humiliate me? 
- I'm defending my client. 
At my expense. 
Renee. 
When Seaman Granato didn't get the school she wanted, she caved in to selfishness. 
And became a deserter instead. 
When she was apprehended, she tried to dodge responsibility by saying her recruiter lied to her. 
But she is an adult and she did sign on the dotted line. 
I ask you to convict Seaman Granato on all charges and specifications. 
There are no villains in this case. 
Though there is a victim. 
Seaman Andrea Granato. 
We cannot castigate the Navy for wanting to bolster its ranks, and we cannot pillory its recruiters for responding aggressively to the Navy's requirements. 
These charges against Seaman Andrea Granato, who joined the Navy eagerly yet blindly, far outweigh her transgressions. 
Acquit her. 
In the name of basic decency. 
Would the defence please rise? 
Captain Imhoff, will you announce the findings, please? 
On the charge and specification of dereliction of duty, this court-martial finds you not guilty. 
On the charge and specification of desertion, this court-martial finds you not guilty. 
On the lesser included offence of unauthorized absence, this court-martial finds you guilty. 
On the charge and specification of missing ship's movement, this court-martial finds you guilty. 
I'll commence sentencing at 0900 tomorrow. 
This court is adjourned. 
What's gonna happen to me now, sir? 
If we're lucky, no confinement, but a bad-conduct discharge. 
- Not out celebrating? 
- I don't feel like it. 
You did what you could, Harm. 
It was a loser case. 
Have you talked to Renee? 
Since when did you start worrying about Renee? 
Colonel, commander. 
Harriet's not angry at me anymore. 
Harriet's not mad at him anymore. 
- Baby? 
- I'm pregnant. 
- Congratulations. 
- Thank you. 
- Oh, congratulations, Bud. 
- Thank you, sir. 
- Oh, that's great. 
- Way to go, Bud. 
- Thank you, sir. 
- That's so great. 
Way to go, Bud. 
Dr. Walden? 
A.J. Chegwidden. 
No, no, actually, I don't think you'll have to testify. 
Things went pretty well for my friend. 
No. 
Yes, he really does exist. 
But that's not why I was calling. 
I was hoping- 
- Wondering if you were free Saturday night. 
Standing in the door, I could see... 
... the lights on a drop zone. 
And I had to assume that was our drop zone, way ahead of us. 
And.... So we had the red light. 
I had everybody standing up, ready to jump. 
So when the plane started to get hit, and suddenly... 
... the pilot gives me the green light, I'm out the door. 
Got such an opening blast or opening shot from the prop blast... 
... that it broke this chinstrap that we had on the helmet liner. 
That's when I lost this famous leg bag everybody talks about. 
Just from the shock of the opening. 
It just flew right off my foot. 
We came from the sky. 
We hit, and in any direction you went, there would be enemy. 
You knew it. And that was all part of what you accepted. 
How do you prepare yourself mentally? 
Each man must do that himself. 
Each man must prepare himself mentally... 
... to make that jump. 
In the back of your mind, you wonder what's gonna happen. 
You know you've been trained and trained... 
... and what your job is and what you're supposed to do. 
That's what you gotta think about. 
We lost a lot of people that night. 
But you try to put it all out of your mind. 
Give me a light. 
Did Evans make it? 
He's in Lt. Meehan's stick, sir. 
Lt. Meehan. 
Lt. Meehan. 
Will could use some help. 
Will! 
Will, hey! Will! 
I need your help here. Get ready! 
Stand up! 
Hook up! 
Equipment check! 
- Sound off for equipment check! 
- Nine okay! 
- Eight okay! 
- Seven okay! 
- Six okay! - Five okay! 
- Four okay! 
- Three okay! 
- Two okay! 
One okay! 
Jesus Christ! 
Let's go, let's go! 
- Does that light look green to you? 
- Let's go! 
I'm hit! 
Jesus! Tell Meehan to get them out of there! Two o'clock! 
Oh, Jesus Christ! 
- He won't jump, sir! 
- Don't listen! - He's staying on the plane! 
He's not jumping. 
- He's okay! 
Go, sir! Go! 
- All right! 
Where's the goddamn DZ? 
- Maybe three minutes on this bearing! 
- We get lower, we won't need... 
... any frigging parachutes! 
- Slow down! 
- We gotta get some altitude! 
They can't jump at this speed! 
We there? 
Oh, God! 
Oh, no! Let's go! - Flash. 
- Shit. 
That's not the correct reply, trooper. 
- l say" flash," you say" thunder." 
- Yes, sir. Thunder, sir. 
Musette bag. 
Sir, it's Hall, sir. 
I was on the basketball team. 
- Leg bag? 
- Prop blast got it, sir. 
- And my radio and batteries with it. 
- Mine too. 
Landed somewhere behind those trees. 
Okay. 
Follow me. To hell with that! 
Wait until they reload. 
Go. 
- Aren't you D Company? 
- Able, sir. 
Means one of us is in the wrong zone. 
Yeah, or both of us. 
- Do you have a weapon, sir? 
- Just my knife. 
Do you have any idea where we are, sir? 
Some. 
- So you're a radioman. 
- Yes, sir. 
I was until I lost my radio on the jump. 
I'll get chewed out for that. 
If you were in my platoon, I'd say you were a rifleman first, radioman second. 
Maybe you could say that to my leader. 
When we find him. lf we find him. 
It's a deal. 
First, I need your help. 
Locate some landmarks to get our bearings. 
Keep your eyes peeled for buildings, farmhouses... 
... bridges, roads, trees. 
I wonder if the rest are as lost as we are. 
We're not lost, private. 
- Who's that? 
- Lt. Winters? 
- Sit down. 
Any weapon? - No, sir. 
I hit the prop blast, no more leg bag. 
I have a knife and TNT. 
- The 82nd boys got M-1 s though. 
- 82nd? 
- Where are we? - Sir, I saw a sign back there. 
It said" Sainte-Mère-Eglise." 
Flashlight? 
Raincoat? 
- You got a raincoat? 
Seven kilometers from our objective. 
Four hours from our deadline. 
So, we got a lot of walking ahead of us. 
You'll stick with us until we find your unit. 
Let's go. 
- Where are we going? 
- Causeway 2, Utah Beach. 
Germans in the fields. 
We need to clear it for our boys. 
Five of us won't secure a road. 
That looey don't even have a weapon. 
I don't recall railroads near our objective. 
This is the spur line, parallel to the river. 
- We'll see a road and bridge. 
- How do you know? 
Because I studied the sand tables, all right? 
Probably a frigging train or- - 
- Flash. - Thunder. 
Lieutenant, is that you? 
- Malarkey. 
- Sir. Sir. 
- Glad to see you, sir. 
- Hey, fellas. - Everybody okay? 
- Good to see you. 
- Sir. 
You and Hall up front. 
Who the hell is Hall? Lipton. 
Go. 
Guarnere. Wait for my command. 
That's enough, Guarnere! 
- Everyone okay? 
- Yes, sir. 
Next time I say wait for my command, you wait for my command, sergeant. 
Yes, sir. Here you go, lieutenant. 
Kraut weapon. 
Fine, Quaker. 
- What's that guy's problem? 
- Gonorrhea. 
Really? 
His name, dummy. 
Guarnere, gonorrhea, get it? 
So besides a shitty name, what's his problem? 
None of your fucking business, cowboy. - All right, let's move out. 
- Sir. 
- You see him? 
He just sat there. 
- He didn't have a weapon. 
- What's he gonna do, shout? 
- Shouts at me for killing Krauts. 
He just wanted you to wait for his command. 
Lipton! 
Anybody need supplies or ammo, now's the time to get it. 
McDowell! You okay? - Yes, sergeant. 
- Well, let's go. 
I promised my brother I'd bring him a Luger. I got first dibs. 
Check that one. 
- The Navy! - Landings have started. 
- Move it out. 
- Right on time. 
- Yeah? 
Tell that to him, cowboy. - My name's Hall. 
- That so? 
- Let's move out. 
- Learn to return his fire. 
- lt ain't about you. - He heard his brother- - 
- Malarkey, shut your yap. 
His brother got it at Cassino. 
Found out before we jumped. 
Morning, sir. 
- Battalion will be happy to see you. - Where? 
At the farm, sir. 
Top of the morning to you, fellas. 
Enjoying the war? 
Where you from, son? 
Eugene, Oregon. 
You gotta be kidding me. 
Popeye, did you hear this? 
I'm from Astoria. 
- You don't say. - Yeah. 
Orange Street. 
- Why are you in a Kraut uniform? 
- Volksdeutsche. 
- Come again? 
- My family answered the call. 
All true Aryans should return to the Fatherland. 
- Joined up in' 41. 
- You're shitting me. 
Hey, Malarkey! Stop fraternizing with the enemy! 
Get over here! 
- What got you to Eugene? 
- l was born in Eugene. Really? 
Popeye. 
Hey, Popeye! 
- Hey, Harry! - Carry on. Easy Company. 
- Good to see you. 
- This here's Hall, Able Company. - Known as Cowboy. 
- You from Texas? 
- Manhattan. 
Lt. Winters! 
- What's the holdup? 
- Not sure. 
Five'll get you ten it's got something to do with that. 
It's good to see you. 
Yeah, you too, Buck. 
What's the situation? Not good. 
Ninety percent of the men are unaccounted for. 
- Lt. Meehan? 
- No one's seen him. 
If he is missing... 
... wouldn't that put you in line to be the next commander of Easy? 
Hey, Lt. Speirs. 
How many men of Dog Company got assembled? 
- Maybe 20. 
- You the only officer that made it? 
So far. 
Still waiting for orders. 
You got some cigarettes? 
Yeah. 
Keep the pack. 
Yeah, so I was in the plant in' 39. 
I was at Monarch tooling propeller shafts. 
What are the chances? 
You and me a hundred miles apart, working at the same job. 
- Hey, Malark! We're waiting on you. - Yeah, I'm coming. 
I gotta run. 
I'll see you around. 
Yeah, see you around. 
Zigaretten? 
Here you go. 
Danke. 
Thank you. Shit. 
Easy Company? 
Easy? 
Hey, any of you guys know where Easy Company is? - You seen Lt. Meehan? 
- No, not yet. 
Well, Maj. Strayer wants Easy Company's CO up front. 
- That means you, Dick. - Come on. 
Son of a bitch. 
Hey, Malark, where's the best chow? 
In Berlin. - Let's round them up. - Okay. 
- l'd say around here, sir. 
But I can't be sure. 
There's Kraut 88s. 
Ahead and to the right about 300 yards. 
Through the gardens. 
They're between us and Causeway 2. 
Firing on the boys landing at Utah. 
- Can Easy handle it? - Yes, sir. 
My guess is, they're doing some terrible damage there. 
The 88s we've heard have been spotted in a field... 
... down the road a ways. Major Strayer wants us to take them out. 
There are two guns that we know of, firing on Utah Beach. 
Plan on a third and a fourth... 
... here and here. 
The Germans are in the trenches... 
... with access to the entire battery. 
Machine gun covering the rear. 
We establish a base of fire and move under it with two squads of three. 
How many Krauts you think we're facing? 
- No idea. 
We'll take some TNT along with us. Despite the guns. 
- Your responsibility. - Yes, sir. 
Liebgott, take the first machine gun, with Petty A-gunner. 
Plesha, Hendrix, you take the other. 
Who does that leave? 
Compton, Malarkey, Toye, Guarnere. 
We'll be making the main assault. 
Yes, sir. 
Let's pack it up, boys. 
Shouldn't you be with the Able Company guys? 
See you around, Hall. 
Lipton, when you see we've captured the first gun, I want your TNT fast. 
Yes, sir. 
Okay. Just weapons and ammo, drop everything else. 
Got spare ammo in a pack or a musette bag, bring it. 
Lieutenant, sir? 
I was wondering, you need an extra hand? 
- Ain't you Sink's jeep driver? - So? 
Oh, shit. What's your name, trooper? - Lorraine, sir. 
- You're with me, Lorraine. 
- Compton, second squad. - Yes, sir! 
All right, you heard the word. 
Let's move! Let's move! 
Three cannons. Petty, we've got enfilading fire. 
All right, let's go. 
Stay down. 
MG42s. I'll draw fire to the right of the truck. 
Take two men and hit them... 
... from the left. Go. 
Right. Take Ranney, envelop right, give covering fire. 
Lorraine, machine gun. 
Don't give away your position early. 
I want TNT as soon as we've captured the first gun. 
- Go. - Yes, sir. 
Go. I can't see nothing. Come on, Buck. 
Shit! 
Let's go! 
Follow me! 
Fuck! 
My ass! 
Sorry, sir. 
Jesus Christ! 
Fucking jeep jockey. Shit! 
I'm sorry, sir. 
I screwed up. 
Grenade! 
Roll on! Roll on! 
Shoot! One lucky bastard, Joe. 
Guarnere! Malarkey! Lorraine! 
- Compton, covering fire! 
- Yes, sir! 
- Where you hit, Pop? 
- l fucked up my ass, sir. 
Your ass? 
- How bad is it? 
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to fuck up. I don't think it's too bad. 
- Can you make it back yourself? 
- Yes. 
Let's move out. 
Here we go. 
Drop your weapon, Pop, drop your weapon. Come on. One, two, three! 
Get down, Dick, get down! Pop! Popeye! 
Winters! 
Grenade! Toye! 
Let's go! 
Get out of there! 
Get out of there! 
Toye! 
- Joe! 
- Jesus Christ. 
Fucking twice. Jesus Christ! Lorraine! 
Malark! 
Ranney! Let's move! 
They got the first gun! 
- There's the second gun. 
- Grenades first. 
- Then keep going. Go! - Right. 
Shut up. 
- No make dead. 
- Shut up. 
- No make dead. 
- Shut the fuck up! 
Toye, stay down. Stay down! 
- Compton! - All right. 
They're so confused, they're firing on the third gun! 
Better blow this before they realize it. 
- l'm gonna find Lipton. 
- All right. 
Toye! Cover the lieutenant! 
- One of the dead Krauts has a Luger! - So? 
Keep your head low, Petty. 
Move it! 
- Have a little suppressing fire! 
- Jesus Christ! 
Malarkey! 
- Now you stop firing? - Stay low! 
- Shit. 
- Christ, they must think he's a medic. 
He's gonna need a damn medic. Okay, okay, okay. Malarkey! 
- Stay low! 
- What the hell's he doing? Come on! 
Forgot your frigging Luger? 
Want I should go get it for you? Stupid mick! 
- Where's Lipton with that TNT? 
- Don't know, sir. 
- You'll be all right. 
- l'm sorry. - Don't be. 
- Sarge? - Yeah? 
- Think this is a ticket home? 
- Maybe. 
- Shit, I just got here. 
Hiya, Cowboy! 
Shut your fucking guinea trap, Gonorrhea. 
- He's all right. 
- You got a whole Kraut platoon. 
- More, captain. - You need help? 
I need ammo, sir! 
And TNT! 
- l got TNT, sir! 
- Good job, private! 
Hall! Ready? 
I don't have any way to set it off, sir. 
Fire in the hole! 
Plesha! Covering fire. Third gun here. 
Lorraine, grab more potato mashers... 
... and follow me! Malarkey, Hall, you two. 
- Running low on ammo, sir! - And you, Malarkey? 
Okay. 
- Got enough to take the third gun? 
- We'll see! Malarkey, let's go! 
Toye! 
Cover us! 
Okay, Hall. Keep your head down. 
Hall! 
Leave your TNT! 
Fire in the hole! 
Malarkey, cover the front. 
Go to the cannon. Go! 
I'm looking for Battalion Headquarters! 
Are you kidding? 
It's back thataway! 
You mean over- -? 
Fire in the hole! TNT! 
- Don't need it! 
- What? 
- Don't need it! 
- Hall! 
Where'd he come from? 
Winters! Hester said you needed ammo! 
Malarkey! 
As much as you can for everyone. 
Mind if D Company takes a shot at the next gun? 
- All yours! 
- Let's go, Dog Company! - Let's get them, D Company! - Compton! 
- Who is that, Speirs? 
- Out! Get out! 
What's he doing out of the trench? 
- What the hell's he doing? 
Oh, Jesus. 
Sir! 
Had a little trouble getting through that first field. 
- Oh, Christ. 
- We need it at the next gun. 
- Once it's blown, pull out. 
Go! 
- Yes, sir. 
Compton, police them both, then pull out! 
Lorraine! Toye! 
Move out! Move out! 
Move it out! 
MGs first. 
Fall back to your original positions. 
Everyone else, maintain your base of fire. 
Okay! Back to battalion! Go! 
We disabled them and pulled out. 
There's maybe... 
... 40 Krauts manning three MG42s to the rear. 
- Hey, Pop. - Coming through! 
- Forty? 
- Yes, sir. 
We killed maybe around 20, so... 
... probably there's 40 left. 
I think we need artillery or maybe mortars might do the job. 
- Going my way? 
- Sure. Sir. Careful, don't hurt yourself. 
- Nice ride you got here, Nix. 
- Straight from Utah Beach. 
We should put them to work before they're missed. 
2nd Battalion had secured Sainte-Marie-du-Mont. 
Elements of the 4th Division began to move men and material inland. 
The 1 01st Airborne, including Easy Company, was scattered over Normandy. 
Success of the invasion was uncertain. 
We had an hour to rest and find food before we had to move south and secure the town of Culoville. 
- l don't wanna die in this truck. 
- You're stepping on my legs! 
- Jesus, let me out of here. - Light. 
Light discipline. 
Guarnere, close that flap. 
Let the Krauts cook their own goddamn food. 
- How we doing, Malark? 
- Good. - Good? - Yeah. 
The Irish don't know how to cook. 
If you have a reservation someplace else, I'd be happy to go with you. 
- Thank you. 
Jesus Christ, give me some air. 
- Evening. 
- Hello, sir. 
- Something die in here? 
- Yeah, Malarkey's ass. 
- Any word on Lieutenant Meehan, sir? 
Don't that make you our commanding officer, sir? 
Yeah, it does. 
- Sir. 
- Joe, the lieutenant don't drink. 
It's been a day of firsts. 
Don't you think, Guarnere? 
Yes, sir. 
Carry on. - Night, sir. 
- Good night. 
- Oh, sergeant? 
I'm not a Quaker. 
- He's probably a Mennonite. - What's a Mennonite? 
Dick! You know that map you found? 
It had every Kraut gun in Normandy. 
Here. 
Don't ever get a cat. 
What's on your mind? I lost a man today. Hall. 
Thanks. 
A John Hall. 
New Yorker. Got killed today at Brecourt. 
- l never knew him. 
- Yeah, you did. 
Radio op. 506th basketball team, Able Company. 
He was a good man. 
Man. 
Not even old enough to buy a beer. 
Not hungry. 
Hey, Dick. 
I sent that map up to Division. 
I think it's gonna do some good. 
That night I thanked God for seeing me through that day of days. 
And prayed I would make it through D + 1. 
And if somehow I managed to get home again I promised God and myself that I would find a quiet piece of land someplace and spend the rest of my life in peace. 
" Once upon a time there was a lovely princess 
" But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort... " which could only be broken by love's first kiss. 
" She was locked away in a castle... " guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
" Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this deadful prison. " but none prevailed. 
" She waited in the dragon's keep... " in the highest room of the tallest tower... for her true love and true love's first kiss." 
Like that's ever gonna happen

Whoa, Hold on. Do you know what thing can do to you? 
Yeah, it'll grind your bones for its bread. 
Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant. 
Now, ogres- - They're much worse. 
They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin. - No! 
- They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! 
- Actualy, it's quite good on toast.

And stay out! " Wanted. 
Fairy tale creatures." 
All right. This one's full - Take it away!

Your flying days are over. 
That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. 
Come on!

This cage is too small. 
Please don't turn me in. 
I'll never be stubborn again. 
I can change. Please! 
Give ma another chance! - Oh, shut up. 
- Oh! - Next! 
- What have you got? 
- This little wooden puppet. 
I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. 
Five shillings forthe possessed toy. 
- Take it away. 
- Father, please! Don't let them do this! 
- Help me! 
- Next. 
What have you got? - Well, I've got a talking donkey. 
Right. 
Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prouve it. 
Oh, go ahead, little fella. 
Well? 
Oh, oh, he's just- - He's just a little nervous. 
He's really quite a chatterbox. 
Talk, you boneheaded dolt- - 
- That's it. 
I've heard enough. 
Guards! - No, no, he talks! He does. 
I can talk. 
I love to talk. 
I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw. 
- Get her out of my sight. - No, no! I swear! 
Oh! He can talk! 
I can fly! 
- He can fly! 
- He can fly! 
- He can talk! 
Ha, ha! That's right, fool! 
Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. 
Your right have seen a house fly maybe even a super fly, but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. 
Seize him! After him! 
Get him! This way! 
Turn! 
You there. Ogre! 
Aye? 
By the order of Lord Farquaad, I am authorized to place you under arrest... and transport you to a designated... resettlement facility. 
Oh, really? 
You and what army? 
Can I say something to you? 
Listen, you was really, really somethin back there. Incredible! 
Are you talkin' to- - me? 
Whoa! Yes, I was talkin' to you. 
Can I tell you that you was great back there? Those guards! 
They thought they was all of that. 
Then you showed up, and bam! 
They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. 
That really made me feel good to see that. 
- Oh, that's great. 
Really. - Man, it's good to be free. 
Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm? 
But, uh, I don't have any friends. 
And I'm not goin' out there by myself. 
Hey, wait a minute! 
I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. 
You're a mean, green, fightin' machine. 
Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us. Oh, wow! 
That was really scary. 
If you don't mind me sayin if that don ( t work, your breath certainly will get the job done,'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something,'cause your breath stinks! 
You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time- - 
Then I ate some rotten berries. 
I had strong gases eking out of my butt that day. 
Why are you following me? 
I'll tell you why. 
'Cause I'm all alone 
There's no one here beside me 
My problems have all gone 
There's no one to deride me 
But you gotta have friend- - 
Stop singing! 
It's no wonder you don't have any friends. Wow. 
Only a true friend would be that truly honest. 
Listen, little donkey. 
Take a look at me. 
What am I? 
Uh- - 
- Really tall? 
- No! 
I'm an ogre. You know. " Grab your torch and pitchforks." 
Doesn't that bother you? 
Nope. - Really? 
- Really, really. 
- Man, I like you. 
What's your name? 
Uh, Shrek. 
Shrek? 
Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? 
You got a kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody - thinks-of-me thing. 
I like that. I respect that, Shrek. 
You alright. 
Whoo! Look at that. 
Who'd want to live in a place like that? 
That would be my home. 
And it is lovely! 
Just beautiful. You are quite a decorator. 
It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. 
I like that boulder. 
That is a nice boulder. 
I guess you don't entertain much, do you? 
I like my privacy. 
You know, I do too. 
That's another thing we have in comon. 
Like, I hate it when you got somebody in your face. 
You're trying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. There's that awkward silence. 
- Can I stay with you? 
- Uh, what? 
Can I stay with you, please? 
- Of course! 
- Really? 
- No. - Please! 
I don't wanna go back there! 
You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. 
Well, maybe you do. 
But that's why we gotta stick together. 
You gotta let me stay! 
- Please! 
Please! - Okay! Okay! 
- But one night only. 
- Ah! Thank you! 
- What are you- 
- No! 
- This is gonna be fun! 
We can stay up late, swapping' manly stories, and in the mornin' I'm makin' waffles. 
- Where do, uh, I sleep? 
Outside! 
Oh, well, I guess that's cool. 
I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. 
Here I go. 
Good night. 
I mean, I do like the outdoors. 
I'm a donkey. I was born outside. 
I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. 
I'm all alone. There's no one here beside me 
I thought I told you to stay outside. - I am outside. 
Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have? 
It's not home, but it'll do just fine. 
What a lovely bed. 
- Got ya. 
- I found some cheese. - Ow! - Blah! 
Awful stuff. 
- Is that you, Gorder? 
- How did you know? 
Enough! What are you doing in my house? 
Hey! - Oh! 
, no, no, no. 
- Dead broad off the table. 
- Where are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken. 
Huh? 
What? 
I live in a swamp. 
I put up signs. 
I'm a terrifying ogre! 
What do I have to do to get a little privacy? - Aah! - Oh, no. 
Oh, no. - No! 
No! - What? 
What are you doing in my swamp? Swamp! Swamp! 
All right, get out of here. 
All of you, move it! 
Come on! Let's go! 
Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! 
- No, no! No, no. Not there. 
- Oh! 
Hey, don't look at me. 
I didn't invite them. 
Oh, gosh, no one invited us. - What? 
- We were forced to come here. 
- By who? 
- Lord Farquaad. He huffed und he puffed und he... 
signed an eviction notice. 
All right. 
Who knows where this Farquaad guy is? - Oh, I do. 
I know where he is. 
Does anyone else know where to find him? 
- Anyone at all? - Me! Me! 
- Anyone? - Oh! Oh, pick me! 
I know! Me, me! 
Okay, fine. 
Attention, all fairy tale things. 
Do not get comfortable. 
Your welcome is officially worn out. 
In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now... and get you all off my land and back where you came from! 
You! 
You're comin' with me. 
All right, that's what I like to hear, man 
Shrek and donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. 
I love it! 
- On the road again 
I can't wait to get on the road again 
What did I say about singing? 
- Can I whistle? 
- No. - Can I hum it? - All right, hum it. 
That's enough. 
He's ready to talk. 
Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. 
I'm the gingerbread man! 
- You're a monster. 
- I'm not the monster here. 
You are. You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world. 
Now, tell me! 
Where are the others? 
- Eat me! 
I've tried to be fair to you creatures. 
Now my patience has reached its end! 
Tell me or I'll- - 
No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons. 
All right then. 
Who's hiding them? 
Okay, I'll tell you. 
Do you know the muffin man? 
- The muffin man? 
- The muffin man. 
Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane? 
Well, she's married to the muffin man. 
- The muffin man? - The muffin man! 
- She's married to the muffin man. 
My lord! We found it. 
Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in. 
- Magic mirror- - 
- Don't tell him anything! No! 
- Evening. Mirror, mirror, on the wall. 
Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all? 
Well, technically you're not a king. 
Uh, Thelonius. 
- You were saying? 
- What I mean is, you're not a king yet. 
But you can become one. 
All you have to do is marry a princess. 
- Go on. 
So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. 
And here they are! 
Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. 
She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. 
Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. 
Please welcome Cinderella. 
Bachelorette number two \ is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. 
Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. 
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. 
Come on. 
Give it up for Snow White! 
And last, but certainly not least, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead... from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! 
But don't let that cool you off. 
She's a loaded pistol who likes pina coladas and getting caught in the rain. 
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! 
So will it be bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three? 
- Two! Two! - Three! 
Three! - Two! Two! 
- Three! 
Three? 
One? Three? 
Three! 
Pick number three, my lord! 
Okay, okay, uh, number three! 
Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona. 
If you love pina coladas 
- And getting caught in the rain - Princess Fiona. 
- If you're not into yoga 
All I have to do is just find someone who can go- - 
But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night. 
- I'll do it. 
- Yes, but after sunset- - 
Silence! 
I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and DuLoc will finally have the perfect king! 
Captain, assemble your finet men. 
We're going to have a tournament. But that's it. 
That'st it right there. That's DuLoc. 
I told ya I'd find it. 
So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle. 
Uh-huh. That's the place. 
Do you think maybe he's compensating for something? 
Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek. Hurry, darling. 
- Hey, you! 
Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat ya. - I just- 
- I just- - 
It's quiet. 
Too quiet. 
- where is everybody? 
- Hey, look at this! 
Wow! 
Let's do that again! No. No. 
No. 
All right. 
You're going the right way for a smacked bottom. 
- Sorry about that. 
That champion shall have the honour- - no, no- - the privilege... to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona... from the fiery keep of the dragon 
If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the fist runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. 
Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. 
Let the tournament begin! - Oh! 
- What is that? 
- It's hideous! 
- Ah, that's not very nice. 
- It's just a donkey. 
Huh? Indeed. 
Knights, new plan! 
The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! 
Have at him! - Get him! 
- Oh, hey! Now come on! 
Hang on now. Go ahead! Get him! 
Can't we just settle this over a pint? Kill the beast! 
No? 
All right then. 
Come on! 
- Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me! 
And I don't give a damn about my reputation 
And I don't have to please no one The chair! 
Give him the chair! And I don't give damn about my bad reputation 
Thank you! 
Thank you very much! 
I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! 
Ha, ha! 
Shall I give the order, sir? 
No, I have a better idea. 
People of DuLoc, I give you our champion! 
- What? 
- Congratulations, ogre. 
You've won the honour of embarking on a great and noble quest. 
Quest? 
I'm already on a quest, a quest to get my swamp back. 
- Your swamp? 
- Yeah, my swamp! 
Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures! 
- Indeed. 
All right, ogre, I'll make you a deal. 
Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back. 
Exactly the way it was? 
Down to the last slime-covered toadtool. 
- And the squatters? 
- As good as gone. 
What kind of quest? 
Let me get this straight. 
You're gonna go fight a dragon... and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp... which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. 
- Is that about right? 
- Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk. 
I don't get it. 
Why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him? 
Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grind his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip. 
Oh, I know what. 
Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village... and put thier heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open thier spleen and drink their fluids. 
Does that sound good to you? 
Uh, no, not really, no. 
For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think. 
- Example? 
- Example? 
- Okay, um, ogres are like onions. 
- They stink? 
- Yes- 
- No! - They make you cry? 
- No! You leave them out in the sun, they get all brown, start sprouting' little white hairs. 
No! Layers! 
Onions have layers. 
Ogres have layers! 
Onions have layers. 
You gt it? 
We both have layers. 
Oh, you both have layers. Oh. 
You know, not everybody likes onions. 
Cake! Everybody loves cakes! 
Cakes have layers. 
I don't care... what everyone likes. 
Ogres are not like cakes. 
You know what else everybody likes? 
Parfaits. 
Have you ever met a person, you, say," Let's get some parfait," 
they say," No, I don't like no parfait"? 
- Parfaits are delicious. 
You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! 
Ogres are like onions! 
End of the story. 
Bye-bye. See ya later. 
Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet. 
You know, I think I preferred your humming. 
Do you have a tissue or something? 
I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait make me start slobbering. 
Ooh! Shrek! Did you do that? 
You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. 
My mouth was open. Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. 
It's brimstone. 
- We must be getting close. 
- Yeah, right, brimstone. 
Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. 
I know what I smell. It's wasn't no brimstone. 
It didn't come off no stone neither. 
Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location. 
Uh, remember when you said ogres have layers? 
Oh, aye. 
Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. 
Donkeys don't have layers. 
We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves. 
- Wait a second. 
Donkeys don't have sleeves. 
- You know what I mean. 
You can't tell me you're afraid of heights. 
I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickely bridge over a boiling lake of lava! 
Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? 
For emotional support, we'll just tackle this thing together one little baby stap at a time. 
- Really? 
- Really, really. 
- Okay, that makes me feel so much better. 
- Just keep moving. - And don't look down. 
Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look down. \ Keep on moving. 
I'm lookin' down! 
Oh, God, I can't do this! 
Just let me off, please! 
- But you're already halfway. 
- But I know that half is safe! 
Okay, fine. 
I don't have time for this. 
You go back. - Shrek, no! Wait! 
- Don't do that! 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
Do what? 
- Oh, this? 
- Yes, that! Yes? 
Yes, do it. 
Okay. 
No Shrek! - No! 
Stop it! - You said do it! I'm doin' it. 
I'm gonna die. 
I'm gonna die. 
Shrek, I'm gonna die. 
Oh! That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. 
Cool. 
So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway? 
Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. 
I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek. 
You afraid? No, but- 
- Shh. 
Oh, good. 
Me neither. 
'Cause there's nothin wrong with bein' afraid. 
Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation. 
Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. 
With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire, it sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. 
Donkey, two things, okay? 
Shut... up. 
Now go over there and see \ if you can find any stairs. 
Stairs? 
I thought we was lookin' for the princess. 
The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower. 
- What makes you think she'll be there? 
- I read it in a book once. Cool. 
You handle the dragon. 
I'll handle the stairs. 
I'll find those stairs. 
I'll whip their butt too. 
Those stairs won't know which way they're goin'. 
Kick it to the kerb. Don't mess with me. 
I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. 
I wish I had a step right here. I'd step all over it. 
Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the- - 
Dragon! 
Donkey, look out! 
- Got ya! 
No! - Oh, what large teeth you have. 
I mean, white, sparkling teeth. 
I know you probably hear this all the time from your food, but you must bleach,' cause that is one dazzling smile you got there. 
Do I detect a hint of minty freshness? 
And you know what else? 
You're- - you're a girl dragon! 
Oh, sure! I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. 
You're just reeking off feminine beauty. 
What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye? 
Ooh. Oh. 
Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but, you know, I'm, uh- - 
I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings. 
Shrek! No! Shrek! 
Shrek! 
Shrek! 
- wake up! 
- What? Are you Princess Fiona? 
I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me. 
Oh, that's nice. 
Now let's go! 
But wait, Sir Knight. 
This be-ith our first meeting. 
Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment? 
- Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time. - Hey, wait. 
What are you doing? 
You should sweep me off my feet... out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed. 
You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you? 
Mm-hmm. But we have to savour this moment! 
You could recite an epic poem for me. 
A ballad? A sonnet! 
- A limerick? 
Or something! - I don't think so. 
Can I at least know the name of my champion? 
Um, Shrek. 
Sir Shrek. 
I pray that you take this favour as a token of my gratitude. 
Thanks! 
You didn't slay the dragon? 
- It's on my to-do list. 
Now come on! 
But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. 
That's what all the other knights did. 
Yeah, right before they burst into flame. 
That's not the point. 
Oh! 
Wait. Where are you going? 
The exit's over there. 
Well, I have to save my ass. 
What kind of knight are you? 
One of a kind. Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. 
I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. 
I'm not that emotionally ready for commitment of, uh, this- - 
Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for. 
Magnitude- 
- Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. 
Hey, what are you doing? 
Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time. 
We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals. 
I'd really love to stay, but- - Don't do that. 
That's my tail! 
That's my personal tail. 
You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission- - What are you gonna do with that? 
Hey, now. 
No! No! No, no! 
No, no, no! No! Oh! 
- Hi, Princess! - It talks! 
Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick. 
Okay, you two, head for the exit! 
I'll take care of the dragon. 
- You did it! 
You rescued me! 
You're amizing. You're- - You're wonderful. 
You're... a little unorthodox I'll admit. 
But thy deed is great, and thine heart is pure. 
- I am eternally in your debt. 
And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed? 
I hope you heard that. 
She called me a noble steed. 
She think I'm a steed. 
The battle is won. 
You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight. 
- Uh, no. 
- Why not? 
I have helmet hair. 
Please. 
I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer. 
No, no, you wouldn't- -' st. 
But how will you kiss me? 
What? 
That wasn't in the job description. 
Maybe it's a perk. 
No. 
It's destiny. 
Oh, you must know how it goes. 
A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon... is rescue by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss. 
With Shrek? 
You think- - Wait. 
Wait. 
You think Shrek is your true love? 
Well, yes. 
You think that Shrek is your true love! 
What is so funny? 
Let's just say, I'm not your type, okay? 
Of course you are. 
You're my rescuer. 
Now- - Now remove your helmet. 
Look. I really don't think this is a good idea. 
- Just take off the helmet. 
- I'm not going to. 
- Take it off! 
- No! - Now! 
- Okay! Easy. 
As you command, Your Highness. 
- You're a- - an ogre. 
Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming. 
Well, yes, actually. Oh no. 
This is all wrong. 
You're not supposed to be an ogre. 
Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? 
He's the one who wants to marry you. 
Then why didn't he come to rescue me? 
Good question. 
You should ask him that when we get there. 
But I have to be rescued by my true love, not by some ogre and his- - his pet. 
Well so much for noble steed. 
Look princess. 
You're not making my job any easier. 
Well I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. 
You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, 
I'll be waiting for him right here. 
Hey, I'm no ones messenger boy, all right? 
I'm a delivery boy. You wouldn't dare. 
- Ya comin', Donkey? 
- Put me down! 
Yeah, I'm right behind ya. 
Put me down or you will suffer the consequences! 
This is not dignified! 
Put me down! 
Okay, so here's another question. 
Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way. 
How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten? 
You just tell her she's not your true love. 
Everyone knows it what happens when you find your- - 
Hey! 
The sooner we get to DuLoc the better. 
Oh, yeah. 
You're gonna love it there, Princess. 
It's beautiful! And what of my groom-to-be? 
Lord Farquaad? 
What's he like? Well, let me put it this way, Princess. 
Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. 
I don't know. 
There are those who think little of him. 
Stop it. Stop it, both of you. 
You know, you're just jealous that you can never measure up to a great ruler like lord Farquaad. 
Yeah. 
Well maybe you're right, Princess. 
But I'd let you do the" measuring" when you see him tomorrow. 
Tomorrow? 
It's take that long? 
- Shouldn't we stop to make camp? 
- No, that'll take longer. 
- We can keep going. 
- But there are robbers in the woods. 
Whoa! Time out, Shrek! 
Camping's starting to sound good. 
Hey. Come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest. 
I need to find somewhere to camp now! 
- Hey! over here. 
- Shrek, we can do better than that. 
Now, I don't think this is fit for a princess. 
No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches. 
- Homey touches? 
Like what? A door? 
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. 
Do you want me to come in and read you a bedtime story? ' cause I will. I said good night! 
Shrek, what are you doing? 
I just- - You know- - Oh, come on. 
And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields. 
Right. 
Yeah. 
Hey, can you tell my future form these stars? 
Well, the stars don't tell the future, Donkey. 
They tell stories. 
Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. 
- You can guess what he is famous for. 
- All right. 
Now I know you're making this up. No. Look. 
There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench. 
Man, there ain't nothin but a bunch of little dots. You know donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. 
Hmm? Forget it. 
Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp back, anyway? 
Our swamp? 
You know. 
When we're through rescuing the princess and all that stuff. We? 
Donkey, there is no" we". 
There's no" our". 
There's just me and my swamp. 
And the first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall around my land. You cut me deep, Shrek. 
You cut me real deep just now. 
You know what I think? 
I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out. - No, do ya think? 
- Are you hidin' something? 
Never mind, Donkey. 
Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it? 
No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it-alone things. 
- Why don't you want to talk about it? 
- Why do you want to talk about it? 
- Oh, Why you block? - I'm not blocking. 
- Oh yes you are. 
- Donkey, I'm warning you. 
- Who are you trying to keep out? Just tell me that Shrek. 
Who? - Everyone! Okay? 
Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. 
Oh, for' the love of Pete! 
Hey, what's your problem Shrek? 
What do you got against the whole world anyway? 
Look. I'm not the one with the problem, okay? 
It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. 
People take one look at me and go," Aah! 
Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre!" 
They judge me, before they even know me. 
You know what? 
When we met, I didn't think you're was just a big, stupid, ugly ogre. 
Yeah, I know. 
So, uh, are there any donkeys up there? 
Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small and Annoying. 
Okay, okay. 
I see it, now. 
The big shiny one, right there. That's one there? - That's the moon. 
Again. 
Show me again. 
Mirror, mirror, show her to me. 
- Hmph. Ah. Perfect. 
Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that. 
- Oh come on, baby. I said I like it. 
- Donkey, wake up. 
- Huh? 
- Wake up. - What? 
- Good morning. 
How do you like your eggs? 
- Good morning, Princess! 
- What's all this about? You know, we kind of got of to a bad start yesterday. 
I wanted to make it up to you. 
I mean, after all, you did rescue me. 
- Uh, thanks. 
Well, eat up. 
- Shrek! 
What? It's a compliment. 
Better out than in, I always say. 
- Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess. 
- Thanks 
- She's as nasty as you are. 
You know, you're not exactly what I expected. 
La liberte! Hey! 
Princess! 
- What are you doing? Be still, mon cherie, for I am your saviour! 
And I am rescuing you from this green- beast. 
- Hey! 
That's my princess! Go find your own! 
Please, monster! 
Can't you see I'm a little busy here? 
Look, pal. 
I don't know who you think you are! 
Oh, of course! How rude that was. Please, let me introduce myself. 
Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo 
I steal from the rich and give to the needy 
- He takes a wee percentage - But I'm not greedy 
I rescue pretty damsels Man, I'm good 
- What a guy, Monsieur Hood 
I like an honest fight and a saucy little maid 
- What he's basically saying is he likes to get- - 
- When an ogre in the bush grabs a lady by the tush 
- That's bad - That's bad 
When a beauty's with a beast it makes me awfully mad 
He's mad He's really, really mad 
I'll take my blade and ram it through your heart 
Man, that was annoying! 
Oh, you little... 
Um, shall we? 
- Hold the phone. 
Oh! Whoa! , whoa, whoa. 
Hold on now. 
- Where did that come from? 
- What? That! 
Back there. 
That was amazing! Where did you learn that? Well- 
- When one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these things in case there's a- - 
- There is an arrow in your butt! 
- What? - What? 
Oh, would you look at that? 
- Oh, no. 
This is all my fault. 
- I'm so sorry. Why? 
What's wrong? 
- Shrek's hurt. 
- Shrek's hurt. 
Shrek's hurt? 
Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die. - Donkey, I'm okay. 
You can't do this to me Shrek. 
I'm too young for you to die. 
Keep your legs elevated. 
Turn your head and cough. 
- Does anyone know how the Heimlich? - Donkey! Calm down. 
If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns. 
Blue flower, red thorns. 
Okay, I'm on it. 
Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die Shrek. 
And if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light! 
- Donkey! - Oh, yeah. 
Right. Blue Flower, red thorns. 
Blue flower, red thorns. - What are the flowers for? 
- For getting rid of the Donkey. - Ah. 
Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out. 
Ow! Hey! Easy with the yanking'. 
- I'm sorry, but it has to come out. 
- No, it's tender. 
Now, hold on. 
What you're doing here is the opposite of help. - Don't move. 
- Look, time out. 
- Would you- - 
Okay. 
What do you propose we do? 
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. 
This would be so much easier if I wasn't colour-blind! 
- Blue flower, red thorns. - Ow! 
Hold on, Shrek! 
Ow! 
Not good. - Okay. Okay, I can nearly see the head. 
Ahem. 
Nothing happened. We were just, uh- - 
Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do is ask. 
That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was just- 
- Ow! - Hey, what's that? 
That's- 
My beloved monster and me 
We go everywhere together 
Wearin' a raincoat that has four sleeves 
- Gets us through all kinds of weather 
She will always be the only thing 
That comes between me and the awful sting That comes from living in a world that's so damn mean 
La-la, la-la, la-la There it is, Princess. 
Your future awaits you. 
- That's Duloc? - Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think means, he has a really- 
- Ow! Um, I, uh- - 
- I guess we better move on. - Sure. But Shrek? 
- I'm- 
- I'm worried about Donkey. 
- What? - I mean, look at him. 
- He doesn't look so good. 
- What are you talking about? 
I'm fine. Well, that's what they always say, and the next thing you know, you're on your back. 
- Dead. 
- You know, she's right. 
You look awful. Do you want to sit down? 
- You know, I'll make you up some tea. 
- Well, I didn't want to say nothin', but I've got this twinge in my neck, and when I turn my head like this, look. 
- Ow! 
See? 
- Who's hungry? 
I'll find us some dinner. 
- I'll get the firewood. Hey, where are you goin'? 
Oh man, I can't feel my toes! 
I don't have any toes! I think I need a hug. 
Mmm. Mmm. 
This is good. This is really good. 
- What is this? 
- Uh, weedrat. 
Rotisserie style. 
No kidding. 
Well, this is delicious. 
Well, they're also great in stews. 
I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night. 
Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. 
I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you. 
Swamp toast soup, fish eye tartare- - you name it. 
I'd like that. 
- Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle 
- Yes, Shrek? 
Just remember, darling all the while 
Are, you- - 
You belong to me 
Are you gonna eat that? 
Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset. 
- Sunset? 
Oh, no! 
I mean, it's late. 
- I-It's very late. - What? 
Wait a minute. 
I see what's goin' on here. 
- You're afraid of the dark, aren't you? - Yes! 
Yes, that's it. 
I'm terrified. 
You know I'd better go inside. 
But don't feel bad, Princess. 
I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until- - 
Hey, no, wait. 
I'm still afraid of the dark. 
- Good night. 
Good night. 
Oh, what are you talkin' about? 
I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. 
I know that you two are diggin on each other. 
I could feel it. 
Oh, you're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad. 
Oh, come on, Shrek. 
Wake up and smell the pheromones. 
- Just go in and tell her how you feel. 
There's nothing to tell. 
Besides, even if I did tell her that, well you know- - and I'm not sayin' that I do' cause I don't- - she's a princess and I'm- - 
An ogre? 
An ogre. - Hey, where are you goin'? 
- To get... more firewood. 
Princess? Princess Fiona? 
Princess, where are you? 
Princess? It's very spooky in here. 
I ain't playing no games. 
- No, help! - Shh! 
- Shrek! Shrek! 
Shrek! 
- No, it's okay. 
It's okay. 
- What did you do with the princess? 
- Donkey, shhh, I'm the princess. 
- Aah! 
- It's me, in this body. 
Oh, my God! 
You ate the princess! 
- Can you hear me? 
- Donkey! 
- Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there! - No! 
- Shrek! Shrek! 
Shrek! - Shh. 
- Shrek! 
- This is me. 
Princess? 
What happened to you? 
You're, uh, uh, uh, different. 
- I'm ugly, okay? - Well, yeah! 
Was it something that you ate? 
' Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea. 
- You are what you eat, I said. Now- - - No. 
- I've been this way as long as I can remember. 
Look, I ain't never seen you like this before. 
It only happens when the sun goes down. 
" By night one way, by day another. 
" This shall be the norm... " until you find true love's first kiss... and then, take love's true form." 
Ah, that's beautiful. 
I didn't know you wrote poetry. 
It's a spell. 
When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. 
Every night I become this. 
This horrible, ugly beast! 
I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me. 
That's why I have to marry lord Farquaad tomorrow... before the sun sets and he sees me... like this. 
All right, all right. Calm down. 
Look, it's not that bad. 
You're not that ugly. 
Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. 
But you only look like this at night. 
Shrek's ugly 24-7. 
But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant to look. 
Princess, how' bout if you don't marry Farquaad? 
I have to. 
Only my true love's kiss can brake the spell. 
But you know, you're kind of an ogre, and Shrek- - well, you've got a lot in common. 
Shrek? 
Princess, I- 
- Uh, how's it going, first of all? 
Good? Um, good for me too. 
I'm okay. 
I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty and- - well, I don't really like it, but I thought you may like it,' cause you're pretty. 
But I like you anyway. I'd- - uh, uh- - 
I'm in trouble. 
Okay, here we go. I can't just marry whoever I want. 
I mean, really, who could ever love a beast so hideous and hugly? 
" Princess" and" ugly" don't go together. 
- That's why I can't stay here with Shrek. 
My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love. - Don't you see, Donkey? 
That's just how it has to be. 
It's the only way to break the spell. - You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth. 
- No! 
You can't breathe the word. 
No one must ever know. 
What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets? 
Promise you won't tell. Promise! 
All right, all right. 
I won't tell him. 
But you should. I just know, before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy. 
- Look at my eye twitching'. 
I tell him, I tell him not. 
I tell him, I tell him not. 
I tell him. 
Shrek! 
Shrek, there's something I want- - 
Shrek. 
- Are you all right? - Perfect! 
Never been better. 
- There's something I have to tell you. 
You don't have to tell me anything, Princess. 
- I heard enough last night. - You heard what I said? 
Every word. 
I thought you'd understand? 
Oh, I understand! 
Like you said," Who could love a hideous, ugly beast?" 
But I thought that wouldn't matter to you. Yeah, well, it does. 
- Ah, right on time. 
Princess, I brought you a little something. 
What'd I miss? Who said that? 
Couldn't have been a donkey. 
Princess Fiona. 
As promised. Now hand it over. 
Very well, ogre. 
The deed to your swamp, cleared out as agreed. 
Take it and go before I change my mind. 
Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, 
For I've never seen such a radiant beauty before. 
I am lord Farquaad. 
Lord Farquaad? 
- Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying... a short... farewell. 
That is so sweet. 
You don't have to raise good manners on the ogre. 
It's not like it has feelings. No. You're right. 
It doesn't. 
Princess Fiona, beautiful fair flawless Fiona. 
- I ask your hand in marriage. 
Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom? 
Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make- - 
Excellent! 
I'll start the plans for tomorrow we wed! 
No! I mean, uh, 
Why wait? 
Let's get married today before the sun sets. 
Oh, anxious, are we? 
You're right. 
The sooner, the better. 
There's so much to do! There is the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest list. 
Captain, round up some guests. 
Fare-thee-well, ogre. Shrek, what are you doing? 
You let her get away. 
- Yeah? So what? 
- Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. 
Look, I talked to her last night. 
She's Yeah I know you talked to her last night. 
You're great pals, aren't ya? 
Now, if you two are such good friends, why didn't you follow her home? 
- I wanna go with you. 
I told you, didn't I? 
You're not coming home with me. 
I live alone! 
My swamp! Me! Nobody else! 
Nobody! 
Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys! 
- Yeah. 
You know what? 
You thought wrong! 
Shrek. 
I heard there was a secret chord 
That David played and it pleased the Lord 
But you don't really care for music, do ya 
It goes like this the fourth, the fifth 
The minor fall the major lift 
The baffled king composing hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Baby, I've been here before 
I know this room I've walked this floor 
I used to live alone before I knew you 
I've seen your flag on the marble arch 
But love is not a victory march 
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 
And all I ever learned from love 
Is how to shoot at someone - Who outdrew you 
And it's not a cry you can hear at night It's not somebody who's seen the light 
- It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Hallelujah Hallelujah 
Donkey? - What are you doing? 
I would think, of all the people, you would recognize a wall when you see one. 
Well, yeah. 
But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it. 
It is around your half. 
See, that's your half, and this is my half. 
Oh, your half? Hmm. Yes, my half. 
I helped rescue the princess. 
I did half the work, I get half the booty. 
Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head. 
- No, you back off. 
- This is my swamp! 
- Our swamp. 
- Let go, Donkey! 
- You let go. 
- Stubborn jackass! 
- Smelly ogre. 
Fine! 
- Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet. 
- Well, I'm through with you. 
Uh-uh. 
Well, you know, with you it's always," Me, me, me!" 
Well, guess what! Now it's my turn! 
So you just shut up and pay attention! 
You are mean to me. 
You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! 
You're always pushing me around or pushing me away. 
Oh, yeah? 
Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back? Because that's what friend do! 
They forgive each other! 
Oh, yeah. 
You're right, Donkey. 
I forgive you... for stabbing' me in the back! 
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings. 
- Go away! 
- There you are, doing it again just like you did to Fiona. 
And all she ever do was like you, maybe even love you. 
Love me? 
She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. 
I heard the two of youtalking. 
She wasn't talking about you. 
She was talking about, uh, somebody else. 
She wasn't talking about me? 
Well, then who was she talking about? Uh-uh, no way. 
I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. 
- Right? Right? 
- Donkey! 
- No! 
- Okay, look. 
I'm sorry, all right? 
Hmph. 
I'm sorry. 
I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre. 
Can you forgive me? Hey, that's the friends are for, right? 
Right. Friends? 
Friends. 
So, um, what did Fiona say about me? 
Why don't you just go ask her? 
The wedding! 
We'll never make it in time. 
Ha-ha-ha! 
Never fear, for where there's a will, there's a way. 
And I have a way. 
- Donkey? I guess this is just my animal magnetism. 
Aw, come here, you. 
Don't get all slobbery. 
No one likes a kiss ass. 
All right, hop on and hold on tight. 
I hadn't have a chance to install seat belts yet. 
People of DuLoc, we gather here today... to bear witness... 
- Excuse me. 
- Could we just skip ahead to the" I do's"? 
Go on. 
If we need you, I'll whisle. How about that? 
Shrek, wait, wait! 
Wait a minute! 
- You want to do this right, don't you? 
- What are you talking about? 
There's a line, There's a line you gotta wait for. 
The preacher's gonna say," Speak now or forever hold your peace." 
- That's when you say," I object!" 
- I don't have time for this! 
Wait, wait. 
What are you doing? 
Listen to me! 
- Look, you love this woman, don't you? 
- You wanna hold her? 
- Yes. 
- Please her? 
- Yes! 
Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness 
- The chicks love that romantic crap! - All right! Cut it out. 
- When does this guy say the line? 
- We gotta check it out. - And so, by the power vested in me, 
- What do you see? 
- The whole town's in there. 
- I know pronounce you husband and wife, 
- They're at the altar. - king and queen. 
- Oh, for the love of Pete! 
I object! 
- Shrek? 
Oh, now what does he want? 
Hi, everyone. 
Havin' a good time, are ya? 
I love DuLoc, first of all. 
- Very clean. 
- What are you doing here? 
Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you. 
- but showing up uninvited to a wedding- - 
- Fiona! 
- I need to talk to you. 
- Oh, now you wanna talk? 
Well, it's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me- - 
- But you can't marry him. - And why not? Because- 
- Because he's just marrying you so he can be king. 
Fiona, don't listen to him. 
- He's not your true love. 
- And what do you know about true love? 
Well, I- - Uh- - 
I mean- - 
- Oh, this is precious. 
the ogre has fallen in love with the princess! - Oh, good Lord. 
An ogre and a princess! 
Shrek, is this true? Who cares? 
It's preposterous! 
Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away for our" happily ever after." Now kiss me! Mmmm! 
" By night one way, by day another." I wanted to show you before. 
Well, uh, that explains a lot. 
Ugh! 
It's disgusting! 
Guards! 
Guards! 
I order you to get that out of my sight now! 
Get them! - Get them both! 
- No, no! 
This hocus-pocus alters nothing. 
This marriage is binding, and that makes me king! - See? See? 
Shrek! - No! 
Don't just stand there, you morons. 
Get out of my way! Fiona! 
- You'll beg for death to save you! - No! Shrek! 
- And as for you, my wife. 
- Fiona! 
I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days! - I am king! 
I will have order! I will have perfection! 
I will have- - 
Aaah! 
Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it. 
- I'm a donkey on the edge! 
Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they? 
Go ahead Shrek. 
Uh, Fiona? 
Yes, Shrek? 
- I love you. Really? 
Really, really. 
I love you too. 
Fiona? Fiona. 
Are you all right? 
But I don't understand. 
I'm supposed to be beautiful. But you are beautiful. 
I was hoping this would be a happy ending. 
I thought love was only true in fairy tales Oy! 
Meant for someone else but not for me 
Love was out to get me 
That's the way it seemed 
Disappointment haunted all my dreams

I do not move. 
Very slowly, I put snow in my mouth, then he won't see my breath. 
I take my time. 
I let him come closer. 
I have only one bullet. 
I aim at his eye. 
Very gently, my finger presses on the trigger. 
I do not tremble. 
I have no fear. 
I'm a big boy now. 
Ready, Vassili? 
Now, Vassili. 
Fire! 
Fire, Vassili! 
Fire! 
Come on, pick your feet up. 
Get on your feet. 
Prepare to board the train. 
You there, come along with me now. 
This way, pal. 
All civilians, get out! 
Make way, let the civilians off. 
This is a military convoy. 
No one stays on board but our valiant soldiers. 
This is a convoy to Stalingrad... only for the soldiers of the Red Army. 
All aboard! 
Autumn, 1942. 
Europe lies crushed beneath the Nazi jackboot. 
The German Third Reich is at the height of its power. 
Hitler's armies are charging through the heart of the Soviet Union... towards the oil fields of Asia. 
One last obstacle remains. 
A city on the Volga... where the fate of the world is being decided : 
Stalingrad. 
Glorious comrade Stalin... has ordered not another step backwards. 
The people of the Soviet Union shall be free. 
Go forward, comrades. 
Not a step backwards! 
Listen to these letters sent by Russian mothers... to their sons on the front. 
" Volodya, my child, I know that it's for our motherland... 
" I know that it's for our motherland that you are giving your life. 
" Everyone here knows that you will not fall back. 
" Everyone here is proud of you. 
" Your father is dead. 
Your brothers are dead. 
Avenge us on the hordes of fascists." 
Get back or I'll shoot! 
Back from the rails, or we shoot. 
Shoot the traitors! 
Come on, come on! 
Move! 
Come on, comrades, come on! 
Move, or you'll be shot! 
Over here, stretcher! 
The one with the rifle shoots! 
One out of two gets a rifle. 
The one without follows him! 
When the one with the rifle gets killed, the one who is following picks up the rifle and shoots! 
The one with the rifle shoots! 
The one without follows him! 
When the one with the rifle gets killed, the one who is following... picks up the rifle and shoots! 
The one with the rifle shoots! 
- This way, now. 
- The one without follows him! 
Soldiers of the glorious Red Army, from now on... it is either victory or death! 
- Those who retreat will be shot. 
- I need a rifle. 
There will be no mercy for cowards and traitors! 
It's hopeless, comrades. 
Get back! 
Pull back! 
Pull back! 
In the name of the Soviet Union, not a step backwards, or we shoot. 
No retreat! 
Not a step back! 
- No mercy! 
- Deserters will be shot. 
- Fire! 
- Shoot the traitors! 
Cowards will be shot! 
No mercy for cowards! 
Russians, surrender. 
You will see your home again. 
This is not your war. 
Join your German comrades, they understand your suffering... and will care more for you than your own officers, who are only sending you to your death. 
The Third Reich is not your enemy. 
The enemy is bloodthirsty Stalin and his Bolshevik camp, who have stolen your land, who have deported your father... 
Fire! 
You'll get us caught, comrade Commissar. 
With your permission, comrade Commissar. 
- Which one should I aim at first? 
- You should wait... till there's an explosion. 
- Do you know how to shoot? 
- A little. 
Don't shoot. Don't shoot. 
He's looking at us. 
Thank you, comrade Commissar. 
Danilov, political officer, second class. 
Twenty - first infantry. 
" Vassili Zaitsev." 
" On this day, September the 20th, 1942, 
" a shepherd boy from the Urals... 
" Arrived in the city of Stalingrad, on the banks of the Volga. 
" His name is Vassili Zaitsev. 
" Like thousands before him, he came to answer comrade Stalin's call. 
" Armed with a rifle, he quickly made the fascist invader realize that... 
" from now on he would be punished for every step he took in the motherland ; 
that from here on, the only way was back." 
What do you think? 
I think comrade Commissar's been overgenerous. 
By order of comrade Stalin, no civilian can leave the city. 
Get back! 
Stand away, or we will open fire. 
Stand away! 
Get back! 
Get back or we shoot! 
Back! 
Keep back! 
Make way for comrade Stalin's envoy! 
I carried out my orders. 
I sent in all of my boys. 
But the Germans engulfed us. 
They have artillery, aircraft, tanks. 
- And me, what did I have? 
- The sacred duty to resist! 
I have to report to the boss. 
Perhaps you'd prefer to avoid the red tape. 
My name is... 
Nikita Sergeyevich Kruschev. 
I've come to take things in hand here. 
This city is not Kursk... nor is it Kiev, nor Minsk. 
This city is Stalingrad. 
Stalingrad! 
This city bears the name of the boss. 
It's more than a city, it's a symbol. 
If the Germans capture this city, the entire country will collapse. 
Now, I want our boys... to raise their heads. 
I want them to act like they have balls! 
I want them to stop shitting their pants! 
That's your job. 
As political officers, I'm counting on you. 
You, what's your suggestion? 
Shoot all the other generals who have retreated... and their chiefs of staff too. 
- Make some examples. 
- D 
- Deport families of the deserters... 
- Yeah, that's all been done. 
Give them hope! 
Here, the men's only choice is between German bullets and ours. 
But there's another way. 
The way of courage. 
The way of love of the motherland. 
We must publish the army newspaper again. 
Stories that extol... sacrifice, bravery. 
We must make them believe in the victory. 
We must give them hope, pride, a desire to fight. 
Yes, we need to make examples. 
But examples to follow. 
What we need... 
are heroes. 
Do you know any heroes around here? 
Yes, comrade, I know one. 
That's me! 
" Vassili Zaitsev." That's me! 
No, you're not dreaming. 
It's your name. 
We made the front page. 
They haven't changed a word. 
Do you have any idea what this means? 
It's not the back page, it's not the second page, 
- it's the front page. 
- The front page! 
They're going to reprint our article everywhere. 
In the Caucasus, in the Crimea, even in the Urals. 
Tomorrow morning, Stalin himself will be sitting over breakfast, reading my words, memorizing your name. 
We're famous, Vassili. Kruschev loved the article. 
He's promoted me to the general staff. 
And you to sniper division. 
- Well, that's good. 
- It's very good. 
- It's very good. 
It's great. 
- It's very great! 
- It's great! 
- For us because we did it together. 
Together! 
- Although I did all the hard work. - Oh, yeah? 
- You're very lucky I can't fight back. 
- Why's that? 
Because Kruschev told me to make sure nothing happens to you. 
- You're too important. 
- I'm too valuable. 
Yes, careful of my... careful of my glasses, please. They're new. 
Sorry, sir. 
- I'm famous! 
We're famous! 
- I'm famous! I'm famous! 
Vassili, the young shepherd from the Urals, killed his 12th German officer today. 
He used to hunt wolves, now he shoots fascists. 
Today, Vassili Zaitsev shot his 23rd German officer. 
He is an example to us all. 
Vassili shot his 32nd German officer. 
Count only the Germans you have killed. 
- Today, Vassili Zaitsev... 
- Here is the evidence... 11 dog tags retrieved by sniper Vassili Zaitsev. 
More and more men and women, fighters from all branches of our armed forces, join the sniper division and learn the skills of Vassili Zaitsev. 
I am a stone. 
I am a stone. 
I breathe slowly. 
I aim at the eye. 
So it is you, the great Vassili Zaitsev. 
- My mother makes potatoes with bacon. 
- Sounds good. 
When she sees you, she won't believe her eyes. 
- How many today? 
- Only two. 
And the last one, why didn't you shoot him? 
He was only a foot soldier. 
Wasn't worth giving away my position. 
Bless you. 
We know how much we owe you. 
We pray for you every day. 
Every evening, we listen to them talk about you on Radio Moscow. 
Thanks. 
You've certainly managed well down here. 
My parents used to store furniture down here before the war. 
Sacha, drop that right now. 
It's loaded. 
This way, comrade Commissar. 
Thank you, comrade. 
Good evening. 
Comrade Zaitsev? 
My God, where does all this mail come from? 
From all over the country, Mrs. Filipov, from all over. 
This one's from the workers of the Kouzbass. 
They want to name their mine after Vassili. 
Right, let's start with the miners. 
Come on, let's get to work. 
Dear comrades from the Kouzbass, 
- Kouzbass. 
- I thank you for your letter of praise. 
- Praise? 
- R - A - l - S 
And... 
I hope that I can live up... to your expectations... 
A - T - I 
Expectations. 
You're interested in German literature, Mrs. Filipov? 
It's all right, it's our neighbor. 
- Right, where were we? 
- Tania, we have guests. 
Your offer to name... I... I 
- I recognize you. 
He's Vassili Zaitsev. 
I saw your picture in the paper. 
Thank you for everything you're doing. 
- And this is his friend, Commissar... 
- Danilov. 
Danilov. 
Tania is like a daughter to me. 
She used to take care of Sacha when I worked at the factory. 
She even taught him German. 
All these books are hers. 
- Oh, they're yours? 
- She studied German at the university. 
- Which university? 
- Moscow. 
Moscow. Moscow. 
Shouldn't we, uh... 
Yes, let's continue. 
Your offer to name your mine after me... is... a great honor. 
H - O - N. 
Yes, I know. 
Honor. 
Very good. 
Shouldn't we make the point that I'm not the only one fighting? 
That... 
That's excellent... 
excellent idea, Vassili. 
- We can take it even further though. - Oh. 
Your battle for the production of coal... is as worthy as mine. 
There's no" K" in coal. 
- No, you're not going too fast. 
- You sure? 
I just thought is there any other improvements? 
Why don't you get some rest? 
These letters can wait until tomorrow. 
We should carry on. 
We're not tired. 
Thank you, Mrs. Filipov. 
These people... took the trouble to write to us. 
Tomorrow, we may not be around to write back. 
Major Konig, Herr General. 
I was expecting someone... else. 
Certainly not someone so prestigious. 
I imagine you have your reasons... for getting yourself involved in this hellish situation. 
My army is not designed for this kind of fighting. 
Yesterday, yet again, I had to promote... 25 sergeants to replace the officers shot down by their sharpshooters. 
Those snipers are demoralizing my people. 
This city is no more than... a heap of ruins. 
But the fuehrer's persisting. 
He has made it a personal matter between Stalin and himself. 
We should trust the fuehrer's instinct. 
He always managed to lead us to victory. 
We shall be back home for Christmas. 
How are you going to go about finding this young Russian? 
I'll fix it so that he's the one who finds me. 
Vassili. 
Vassili. 
- Come on, time to get up. - What? 
They have a problem in the department store sector. 
They need us. 
Come on. 
Look, Vassili, he's hiding in the department store. Over there. 
So far this morning, he's knocked off five officers, plus two machine gunners. 
Look, third floor, fourth window from the left. 
Fourth window from the left. 
See him? 
Yeah, I see him. 
There, you got him! 
Great shot. 
Let's go get his dog tag. 
Good - bye, comrade Commissar. 
Thank you for your hospitality, Mrs. Filipov. 
You can borrow whatever you like. 
I'm not sure what they would say to me at headquarters... if I came back with an armful of Goethe and Schiller. 
There's some Marx too. 
You were assigned to civil defense at the 12th district? 
No, I volunteered. 
It's such a coincidence meeting you like this. 
Comrade Kruschev was telling me just yesterday... how desperately we're in need of operators who speak German. 
I can't. 
Our militia's responsible for all the people in this neighborhood. 
We're already desperately short of men. 
We'll give you a dozen soldiers for every one that speaks German. 
I'd rather stay and fight. 
Serving at headquarters is fighting. 
You'd be far more useful there. 
You stay here. 
You cover us. 
- All right. 
- We go. 
Take care. 
Ludmilla, come on. 
Check the stairway. 
It's a trap. 
I know. 
Move back. 
He's still here. 
- They're coming straight for us! 
- Ludmilla, stay where you are, he's over there somewhere. 
We have to get out of here! 
- We have to get out of here! 
- Just stay where you are! 
What are we gonna do? 
Ludmilla, stay where you are! 
Fuck this, I'm going. 
Ludmilla, no! 
What does this mean? 
" The little shepherd from the Urals receives a new sniper's rifle, 
" a Mosin - Nagant 7.62, with its 3.5 - Power P.U. Telescope. 
Pride of precision of Soviet production." 
- I've seen that rifle close up. 
- Have you? 
I've even touched it. I know him well, Vassili Zaitsev. 
Ludmilla and Anton were killed today, and it was my fault. 
No, I'm sure that's not true. 
There was a German sniper. 
I walked them right into his trap. 
- What else can you tell me? 
- He didn't relocate. 
A sniper who doesn't relocate isn't normal. 
He was very good. 
It wasn't just his shooting, it was his instinct. 
He was a step ahead of me all the time. 
That's because he knows everything about you. 
His name is Konig, Major Konig. 
They've sent him here to ki... to find you. 
At first we weren't sure if the information was reliable. 
It seems he's come all the way from Berlin to stop you. 
You've caused them so many sleepless nights, they sent their top marksman. 
- What do we know about him? 
- He's a major in the Wehrmacht. 
He's director of their sniper school in Zossen. 
Koulikov studied under him at Zossen before the war. 
He knows all his tricks. 
From now on, he'll go with you everywhere. 
A nobleman from Bavaria who hunts deer... against a shepherd boy from the Urals who poaches wolves. 
It's more than a confrontation between two nations. 
It's the essence of class struggle. 
I'm glad you're so happy. 
He had all the advantages. 
Next time you'll be even. 
No one shoots like you, Vassili. 
She's been transferred. 
I'll see if they're ready for you next door. 
- Hello. 
- You look smart in your new uniform. 
Make sure they don't take it back once you've finished. 
Yeah, they probably will. 
I've heard the rumor about the German, and I wanted to wish you luck. 
Thank you. I'll need it. 
From what comrade Danilov tells me, you're going to win. 
Hmm. 
It's time. 
- Vassili! Vassili! - Come to my arms. 
Look in my direction. 
Put your cap back on, you look more heroic. 
- This way, comrade Zaitsev. 
- I love this little fellow. 
Vassili, is it true that you volunteered for the front? 
How old are you, Vassili? 
Do you know what this duel means for our country? 
Is it true you killed your first wolf when you were five? 
Are you proud to be challenged by the best sharpshooter in Germany? 
The Germans are starting to shit their pants. 
Go on, my boy, tell us how you're going to deal with him. 
- Or rather, no. 
Tell it to the boss. 
- One more question, please. 
He likes good hunting stories. 
Look at him with pride, because he's looking at you. 
The whole country is looking at you. 
Forgive me, forgive me, Grandfather. 
So, it's not the wolf that chooses the hunting ground... but the hunter. 
But I'm sure your grandfather taught you that. 
Except in this case, 
I'm the game. 
However, today what we're going to do... is lure the wolf out of his lair... to where we want him to be. 
You're the one whose life is valuable. You go first. 
No, no. 
We take it in turns. 
Next time is your turn to go first, and then it's you, Volodya. 
Son of a bitch! 
These are new pants. 
I just took them off a captain from the 251 st yesterday. 
Sixteen months I spent in Germany at the school in Zossen. 
Of course, those were the days when we were friends with the Krauts ; 
when our Joseph and their Adolph... were walking hand in hand. 
From here to the wire, 160 meters, right? 
One hundred and fifty - five. 
Whatever. 
That'll make' em send out a repair guy. 
Let's relocate. 
Aah! 
Hey, Volodya! 
After the Germans invaded us, it wasn't the same atmosphere anymore. 
Threw my ass in prison. 
What were you doing in Germany, huh? 
Excuse me, says I, but it was comrade Stalin who sent me there. 
Don't bring our glorious leader into your treachery. 
Confess, spy bastard! 
Confess. 
And bang! 
Bang, bang, bang! 
Well, there wasn't a sickle, but there was a hammer. 
And bang. 
Knocked out all my teeth. 
That's right, boy. 
Have no illusions. 
That's the land of socialism and universal bliss for you. 
Hey! 
It's your repair guy. 
I got him. 
It's about soup time, isn't it? 
I'm going. 
Well, get a move on, Volodya, and try not to spill it all on your way back, you Marxist bastard. 
The enemy sniper activity reported during the past 24 hours, Herr Major. 
Two sentries shot in the train station sector. 
One artillery observer in the Northern sector. 
One lieutenant from the 24th Panzer division in the factory sector. 
Three telephone repairmen in the workers'housing sector. 
They also tell me we have just taken a prisoner who may interest you. 
I hope he's still able to speak. 
Excuse me, sir? 
Nothing. 
Thank you. 
So, tell us, Volodya, which building is he in? 
There is no way I know that. 
He moves around all the time. 
He jumps from one to the next. 
On which floor? 
I don't know. 
We'll see about that. 
Undress him. 
Put him in one of our uniforms. 
You see, they are stubborn. 
That's the good thing about the Germans. 
Man, you got to admit when they get an idea in their heads... 
Right. 
Let's see if our customer has arrived. 
Are you ready? 
Uh - huh. 
And now our famous shepherd from the Urals, who Major Konig thinks is an idiot, gets up to make sure he has hit his target. 
Major Konig sees him. 
Aims for his helmet. 
Fires. 
Reveals his position and is shot in turn. 
Major Konig doesn't fire... because Major Konig isn't there. 
Koulikov! 
Don't you think that was strange, that last one? 
They sent him out to get shot like the others. 
It's not natural. 
Not without artillery, without trying to cover him. 
Oh, no, I'm the one who was stupid. 
They don't give a shit about telephone guys. 
I mean, it's like us with the Ukrainians. 
They'd never bother a major over a few dead grunts. 
Tomorrow, we'll kill us some generals. 
Whose turn is it? 
Mine, I think. 
Oh, you're such a cheater! 
You can't fool Papa Koulikov. 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's my turn to go first. 
And it's your turn to get a hole in your britches. 
To victory. 
This sniper business has been dragging on too long. 
What's that little fellow of yours up to? 
He's probing, comrade Kruschev. 
He's testing the Germans for weaknesses. 
He's meticulous in his preparation. 
Vodka... 
is a luxury we have. 
Caviar is a luxury we have. 
Time is not. 
He's aware of that comrade Kruschev. 
We both are. 
I assure you he will succeed. 
Good. 
It seems your destinies are entwined. 
They're keeping you busy. 
I picked this up in the kitchen. 
It's from the reception the other day. 
I thought Mrs. Filipov might like it. 
Um, she will be thrilled. 
That's very sweet of you. 
There's plenty more if you're hungry. 
You're Jewish, aren't you? 
There's nothing in our religion that says you can't eat sturgeon. 
My father had a premonition all this would happen. 
You mean the war? 
He understood that the hatred of the Jews ran deep. 
He was saving up to buy some land in Palestine. 
He said it was the only land we truly belonged in ; 
the only land we had a duty to defend. 
He insisted I learn to use a rifle. 
I learned to shoot. 
I know that in times of war, personal feelings should be put aside, but... 
I have a favor to ask you. 
Of course. Anything you want. 
I want to be reassigned. 
What's happened, Tania? 
He shot him. 
He shot him even though he jumped first. 
Shot him on the run. 
It was an impossible shot. 
I've never seen anything like it. 
You've promised people a victory I can't deliver. 
I don't stand a chance against this man. 
You mustn't talk like that, Vassili. 
What if I told you we found a way to track his movements? 
We've got someone, Vassili. 
Someone close to him passing us information. 
Next time you will be one step ahead of him. 
I promise. 
Now I have a favor to ask. 
From me? 
It's about Tania. 
Come in. 
He doesn't even know you exist. 
But at that moment, you are closer to him than anyone else on earth. 
You see his face through the sight. 
You see whether he shaved that morning or not. 
You can see whether he's married by whether he has a wedding ring on. 
It's not like... just firing at a distant shape, not just a uniform. 
It's a man's face. 
Those faces don't go away. 
They come back and they just... 
they get replaced by more faces. 
Did Danilov ask you to tell me this? 
He likes you very much. 
I think he'd try anything to change your mind. 
Did he tell you why I asked for the transfer? 
No. 
This morning, a list arrived at headquarters. 
It was a list of civilians who'd been... rounded up and sent to Germany in a convoy... that left Stalingrad three weeks ago. 
My parents were amongst them. 
After 30 kilometers, the German soldiers... stopped the train and forced everyone out. 
In the middle of a bridge, they bound them together, two by two. 
Mothers with daughters. 
Husbands and wives. 
They... 
lined them up against the railing, and then they fired a single shot at each pair... to save bullets. 
It worked. 
The bodies of the ones who died dragged the others under the water. 
I know they died together. 
They never would have let themselves be separated. 
That's Koulikov's rifle. 
It's a good... rifle. 
Thank you. 
I know how he leaves the shelter. 
He goes through the tractor factory. 
The tractor factory is big. 
I know exactly where. 
He crawls through a gutter, under a grate where the vats are, then he goes out from the workshop. 
In between the two, there's a place where he's in the open. 
It's under a long, iron foot walk. 
Good luck, comrade. 
I know exactly where he's waiting for me. 
He'll be on the foot walk over the gutter. 
We'll take him out from behind. 
We'll get to the other end of the workshop through these pipes. 
Follow me. 
You go that way. 
I'll go around this way. 
Okay? 
Shit! 
Sergei, you should go back. 
- No, I'll be all right. 
- Go back. 
No, you go! 
Keep your legs in. 
Come on. 
Come on. 
Come on. 
Comrade Stalin is asking for one last effort! 
The fate of the motherland is at risk! 
The fate of all those you love and cherish! 
It's for them that we fight today. 
Listen to me, Tania. 
The Germans are throwing everything at us. 
If they're lucky, one in ten of these soldiers will come back alive. 
You're highly educated. 
You know languages. 
Every intercept you translate saves hundreds of lives. 
Every message you decode kills thousands of theirs. 
You have a duty to survive. 
Vassili was born to fire a gun. It's what he knows. 
You and I were born for a different purpose. 
If Vassili were here, he would tell you the same thing. 
Where is he? 
Where is Vassili? 
Keep your head down. 
- Tell me where he is. 
- Stay into that pipe, Tania. 
Stay in. 
Stay in! 
Get your head in! 
Slow down. 
Don't shoot. 
He's over there. 
Do you see the pillar in front of you? 
I need you to move round behind it. 
Go. 
Tania, I need you to find a large piece of glass. 
Piece of glass. 
Do you see the kiln... behind me to the left of the factory? 
Yes? 
I can't hear you. 
- Yes. 
- Yes. 
Do you see... the two louvers? 
- Do you see the one... with a broken slat? - Yes. 
Yes. 
This is what I want you to do. 
- Are you ready? - Yes. 
Three... two... one... 
Hello, Sacha. 
He was right where you said he'd be. 
Nearly there. 
He's very clever. 
Tell me about him. 
Why was it his grandfather taught him how to shoot and not his father? 
His father's dead. 
His mother too. 
Does he talk about his father? 
No. He didn't know him. 
Did he go to school? 
He knows how to write. 
He answers lots of letters. 
Hmm. Is it girls who write to him? 
Everyone writes to him. 
Is there a girl he loves in his village? 
- Not in his village, here. 
- Does she love him? 
Yes, because he's handsome. 
Because he's brave and she's very beautiful. 
I know her well. 
She's from my neighborhood. 
She went to the university. 
They're handsome together. 
Later, the two of them will get married. 
At least, I think so. 
And you, Sacha, why are you helping the Germans? 
Because they're stronger. 
Because they're going to win the war. 
And because you like chocolate, huh? 
All these people here know they're gonna die. 
So each night when they make it back, it's a bonus. 
Excuse me. 
So, every cup of tea, every cigarette... becomes a little celebration. 
Because for a lot of us, it may be our last night. 
It's just something you have to accept here. 
Everyone has their time. 
In the forest, the wolf lives for three years, the donkey for nine. 
So, that's - that's got to be a proverb from the Urals. 
It makes no sense to me whatsoever. 
The donkey lives longer because he's more useful. 
Makes absolute sense. 
There aren't any donkeys in the forest. 
You made it up. 
So... 
I'm a donkey? 
People like you and Danilov... have to survive this. 
People who have read books, had an education. 
We'll need you when the war is over. 
And if you survive? 
What will the useless Vassili Zaitsev do then? 
I wanna work in a factory. 
My granddad took me to a factory once. 
There was this man there, high up on a... on a foot walk. 
He wasn't wearing blue like the others. 
The people he was supervising didn't understand what they were doing. 
But for him, for him up there, it was simple ; 
it was clear. 
And I thought," One day, I could be that man." 
Sad to have a dream you know won't happen. 
Why shouldn't it? 
You'll outlive us all. 
Hmm. 
You'll be the oldest donkey in the forest. 
" 150 meters stand between the Germans and the Volga. 
" Today the whole world is watching these 150 meters. 
They are what makes Stalingrad..." 
the capitol... of the war. 
Your friend, Tania... have you see her? 
She stays over there now, with the snipers. 
Tell the major we're sending in all of our sharpshooters... to support the attack on the factory. 
Tell him Vassili will be there. 
- I need to talk to you. - Sure. 
- I need to talk to you. 
- Sure. 
- Danilov. 
- Hmm? 
You have to stop writing about me. 
I'm not gonna get him because I'm not good enough. 
Sooner or later, he's gonna find me, he's gonna kill me. 
I've warned you before not to talk like this. 
This time it's different. 
You've built me up... and up into someone I'm not. 
I can't carry that weight anymore. 
I wanna fight. 
I want to fight just as a regular soldier. 
I understand. 
The thing is, you're not a regular soldier. You're extraordinary. 
No, I'm what you've made me. 
Nothing more. 
Why are you telling me this now? 
Hmm? 
What's happened? 
What's changed? 
Did you speak to Tania for me? 
- Yes. 
- Well... will she reconsider? 
I don't know. 
She should. She'll be much safer. 
She should, you know that. 
- Yeah. 
- It'll be easier to get her reassigned. 
The Germans are preparing another offensive in the city center. 
The propaganda battle is crucial for morale. 
We need you more than ever. 
Sacha. 
Hold on. 
Sacha! 
- Tell him what you know, Sacha. 
- Hello, Sacha. 
There was dust on the major's boots. 
Sacha has the major convinced he's gone over to the other side. 
I don't need to tell you the risks he's taking. 
The dust was yellow. 
There's only one place where there's dust like that... in the back of the chemical factory, a big heap on the tracks. 
Well done. 
Sacha... wait for me outside then. 
- Danilov, 
- Hmm? 
You had no right to use him. 
No, no, I didn't use him, Vassili. 
He did it of his own accord. 
You know why? 
Because he believes in you! 
Tomorrow morning, we're going to take back the chemical factory. 
Sacha's informed the major you'll be there, so now you know where you have to wait for him. 
- In the middle of an assault. 
- I'm following orders. 
I suggest you do the same. 
Now, I'm aware of the risks. 
You'll be fine. 
Comrade. 
That's the Germans up there. 
And yesterday was the Russians. 
We're not very far now. 
Sacha... you're playing a very dangerous game. 
I want you to win. 
See there? 
Keep going along the river. 
It's safe... for a while. 
He's dead. 
We found this on his corpse. 
Your reason for being here has ceased to exist. 
Pardon me, Herr General, but I do not believe... 
There is a plane bound for Berlin tomorrow evening. 
You will be on it. 
Until then, I must ask you for your dog tags. 
Imagine how Russian propaganda would profit from your death. 
If you fall, you will fall unknown. 
You've already had a near miss. 
Also please take this War Merit Cross. 
It was awarded posthumously... to a lieutenant of the 116th Infantry Division... who fell here during the first days of the battle. 
He was my son. 
If the landing is captured, everything's lost! 
Come here. 
What did I tell you? 
You've been playing your fiddle too much! 
If it's confirmed that he's dead, we're sunk! 
- Well, you're sunk. 
- It isn't true. 
It was intercepted from their staff headquarters. 
What do they have to do, dangle his body in front our our men? 
They're lying. 
That's good. 
Very good. 
Write it, then. " Vassili Zaitsev is not dead. 
This is a picture of him reading today's newspaper." You're the poet. 
What? 
You won't give up the riverbank! 
I don't care if you've lost half your men! 
Lose the other half, or lose yourself! 
Is he back? 
He should be back soon. 
The German attack cut the lines. 
That's why he's late. 
Can we go outside? 
I wrote to my mother about you. 
She wanted me to tell you that once this war was over, if there's anything you needed... 
anything at all... our family will be there for you. 
You know I'm here for you. 
They're saying Vassili is dead. 
Vassili Zaitsev will never see his loved ones again. 
Surrender! 
This is your only hope. 
You're upset. 
Because Zaitsev is dead? 
You don't have to hide it. 
There's no shame in it. 
You're a Russian like he is. 
Don't listen to them. 
It's just propaganda. 
He isn't dead. 
And do you know why? 
Because I haven't killed him yet. 
I'm going to tell you a little secret. 
Only you, because I know I can trust you. 
But you must swear to me that you won't tell another soul. 
You swear? 
I found a terrific spot. 
It's by the exit from the train station. 
I'll hide in the water tower. 
Tomorrow. I'll wait for him there. 
You'll see. He'll be there. 
He always is. 
I also want you to swear that from now on, you'll stay home where you belong. 
Do you swear? 
Yes? 
Good. 
" We know he's alive. 
We know he won't fail us. 
We know because he is a part of us now. 
Vassili is eternal." 
Where have you been? 
We've looked everywhere for you. 
Oh, didn't you hear? 
I was dead. 
At least the noble sniper Zaitsev... 
Vassili was dead. 
The real one. 
Me... 
I was asleep, and I missed my chance. 
Then, I was curled up in a corner, hiding... from a man who wants to kill me. 
I'll talk to Kruschev. 
He'll send you back to your old division. 
- Where's Tania? 
- She's at the shelter. 
I've been to the shelter. 
I told her you weren't dead. 
The major said so. 
He said the other Germans were lying. 
He told me you were waiting for him at the station. 
Vassili. 
Vassili. Vassili. 
My little Sacha. 
I knew it. 
- Vassili. 
- Tania. 
I knew you weren't dead. 
How? 
Because we only just met. 
I prayed for the first time since I was a little girl. 
When I opened my eyes, Sacha was standing there... waiting to give me the good news. 
I think he loves you even more than I do. 
To the proper military authority, 
I'm calling to the commandant's attention the recent changes noticed... in the attitude towards fighting of soldier Vassili Zaitsev. 
He has attempted on several occasions to escape his duties, voiced doubts on the chances of our victory... and made defeatist comments in public. 
The inexplicable duration of his duel... with the Nazi sharpshooter can only be explained by... his lack of belief in the communist ideal. 
Good morning, Sacha. 
Once again, he knew exactly where to find me. 
Don't you think that's strange? 
Apart from me, only you knew. 
I don't hold it against you, Sacha. 
You've done a very brave thing. 
You've chosen your camp. 
I respect that. 
But it isn't my camp. 
We're both soldiers, and we're both enemies, so I know you understand. 
I'm annoyed with you, little Sacha, for not staying home as I made you swear to. 
I'm annoyed with you for obliging me to do what I'm going to have to do. 
I've never seen anyone frown so much in their sleep. 
How long have you been watching me? 
All night. 
You've been snoring away happily for hours. 
I don't snore. 
Do I? 
Like a pig. 
I suppose I talk in my sleep as well. 
Yes. 
There's something I should tell you. 
On the train... coming here... we were in the same car. 
No. 
I saw you. 
You were reading, and you fell asleep. 
I didn't dare look at you, you were so beautiful. 
It was scary. 
Afterwards, I couldn't stop thinking about you. 
It made me smile. 
And then I thought of all the men who would get to hold you... who'd make you laugh... how lucky they were. 
And now I'm the one lying next to you. 
And now I'm the one lying next to you. 
- Was I snoring? 
- Like a pig. 
What? 
- Oh, my God! 
- Oh, no. 
- Oh, my God! 
- Tania, no. 
- Tania, no! 
- No, get off me! 
- Get off me! 
Get off me! - It's what he wants! 
- This is what he wants! 
- Get off me! 
- No, he'll kill you. 
He'll kill you! 
- Let me go! 
- I'll run after you, and he'll kill me. 
- Let me go! 
- Let me go! 
- This is what he wants! 
I'll get him. 
I promise I'll get him. 
I'll get his rifle for you. I promise, Tania. 
I need you. 
You have to leave now, Mrs. Filipov. 
Stalingrad may fall. 
The last of the boats are leaving. 
The Germans will be here any moment. 
He's brought you a pass. 
You'll be safe on the other side. 
Gather your things, and we'll help you carry them to the landing stage. 
I'm not leaving. 
This is my home. 
This is my Sacha's home. 
I can't leave. 
I have to tell you something, Mrs. Filipov. 
Something very difficult to understand. 
It's about Sacha. 
He's gone over to the Germans. 
He's betrayed his country. 
He's with the enemy now. 
He won't be coming back. 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God. 
He's become a traitor. 
The poor little thing. 
What has he done? 
So, he's going to stay over there? 
Yes... he's going to stay over there. 
I shouldn't be saying this, comrade Commissar, but maybe it's for the best. 
If the Germans have won, he'll be safe. 
I know it's wrong, but perhaps he has made the right choice. 
- Oh! 
Oh, Tania! 
- Tania? 
- Oh, Tania! 
- Tania! 
Oh, my God! 
Oh! 
I need a doctor! 
A doctor! 
I have a pass. 
I have a pass! 
You must let her cross. 
Please! 
- It's useless. 
She'll never make it. 
- No! 
No, she will! 
She's my daughter! 
She's my daughter! 
- I beg of you! 
- All right. 
- Oh, thank you! 
- Put this one on the boat. 
Where is he? 
Where's the major? 
A few inches from your face. 
I've been such a fool, Vassili. 
Man will always be man. 
There is no new man. 
We tried so hard to create a society that was equal, where there'd be nothing to envy your neighbor. 
But there's always something to envy. 
A smile... a friendship. 
Something you don't have and want to appropriate. 
In this world... 
even a Soviet one... there will always be rich and poor. 
Rich in gifts... poor in gifts. 
Rich in love... poor in love. 
Tania isn't coming back. 
She's dead, Vassili. 
She was cut down by shrapnel. 
It was quick. 
I don't think she even saw it coming. 
She was on her way back to you. 
As soon as she had seen Mrs. Filipov to the boats, she was coming back for you. 
She was right. 
You're a good man, Vassili. 
I want to help you, Vassili. 
Let me do one last thing. 
Something useful for a change. 
Let me show you where the major is. 
Don't do that. 
Don't do that! 
Today, February 3, 1943, is an ominous day for Hitler... and the endless columns of hundreds of thousands of German prisoners. 
It is an unforgettable day of hope for our motherland. 
After 180 days of heroic combat... in the market city of Stalingrad, and as a result of the valor and self - sacrifice of our soldiers, the commander of our glorious Red Army... received the unconditional surrender... of the German fascist invaders. 
Sorry. 
No, young man, I cannot find... 
- a matching name in the book. 
- Could you check again? 
- This is the address and her name. 
- She is not here. 
Yes, this is our address, but we don't have her anymore. 
- This is the address. She's been here. - I'm so sorry. 
- She wrote to me. 
- I looked three times. 
She's not here. 
Believe me, there is no Tania Chernova. 
I'm so sorry. 
- I just talked to my agent- - - Oh, my God! 
I'm sorry. Too soon. You go. 
I got nominated for" Days of Our Lives"! 
- Good for you! 
- Congratulations! 
I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy! 
-" Soap Opera Digest" Award? 
- No. I'm up for a" Soapie." 
Is that something you're making up? 
No, no, no, it's real! 
And it has been, since 1998. 
I'm up for a Soapie! 
Oh, my God! 
My God! 
That's the third most prestigious soap opera award there is! 
Thank you! 
I guess we know who I'll take to the awards! 
Don't kid about that! 
Will all the stars be there? 
Many are scheduled to appear. 
- I can't go. 
I'll be too nervous! 
- I'll go. You're getting married. 
This is all I have. 
The One With Joey's Award English Subtitles by SDI Media Group 
Ernest Muhlbrat hypothesized that the velociraptor, when threatened would expand its collar and emit a high-pitched noise to frighten off predators. 
Mr. Lewis? 
What kind of noise? 
Just a high-pitched, intimidating noise. 
But like how? 
Well, we don't know for sure. 
But in my head, it sounded something like this : 
Of course, this is just conjecture. 
Okay. That's all for today. 
Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment? 
Yes, sir? 
I need to talk to you about your midterm exam. 
- I'm afraid I had to fail you. 
- Why? 
Well, you need 60 % to pass. 
- What did I get? 
- Seven. 
That's not so good. 
No, no, it's not. What happened, Ned? 
Maybe you can cut me some slack. 
I'm sort of in love. 
I'm sorry, but that's really not my problem. 
I'm in love with you. 
That brings me in the loop a little. 
That's why I did so bad on this test. 
I'm having a hard time concentrating. 
When you're up there and you're teaching and your face gets all serious.... 
You look so good. When you wear that tight little turtleneck sweater- - 
I'm your teacher. I'm sorry. You're a student. 
And I like women. 
In spite of what may be written on the backs of these chairs. 
That guy at the counter's totally checking you out. 
Really? 
- Oh, my God, he's really cute! 
- Go for it. 
Phoebe, I'm engaged. 
I'm saying, get his number, just in case. 
But if Chandler's in an accident and can't perform sexually he'd want you to take a lover to satisfy needs he'd no longer fulfill. 
Can I just tell you something? 
I'm very flattered, but I'm engaged. 
This is kind of embarrassing. 
I actually came over to talk to your friend. 
You should be embarrassed. 
- I thought you knew I looked at you. 
- I did, but that was really fun. 
" The winner is... 
" I honestly never expected this. 
I didn't prepare a speech. 
I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. 
Also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel- -" 
- I'm fourth? - Jeez! 
Look at you with your maple syrup award! 
Maybe you don't tell anyone about this? 
No big deal. 
I do that with my shampoo bottle. 
- Really? 
- Yeah. 
- What award are you practicing for? 
- Grammy. For Best New Artist. 
The Soapies people called today. 
I also get to present an award. 
So you'll get on stage even if you don't win. 
- You don't think I'll win? 
- Of course I do. 
But Favorite Returning Character? That's a tough category. 
You're up against the guy who survived his own cremation. 
No, I know I might not win. But it's just.... 
I've never been nominated. I want it so much. 
You'll probably get it. 
But you should start practicing your" gracious-loser" face. 
When the cameras are on you, you want to look disappointed. 
But also that your colleague deserved to win. 
Like : 
You know? - You practice losing the Grammys too? 
- No, at the Grammys, I always win. 
- Hey! 
- How'd your date go with Jake? 
Great. 
We couldn't keep our eyes off each other. 
Every once in a while, he'd lean over, stroke my hair, then touch my neck. 
Stop it. You're getting me all tingly. 
All I could think of was, is he gonna kiss me? 
- Did he? 
- I'm a lady. I don't kiss and tell. 
But this hickey speaks for itself. 
Okay, I got it. I got it. 
I like him so much, I feel like I've had 10 drinks today. I've only had six. 
I haven't had that feeling since I first went out with Chandler. 
- I'll never have that feeling again. 
- You sound like a guy. 
No, a guy would say," I'll never get to sleep with anyone else." 
I'll never sleep with anyone else! 
I'm so busy planning the wedding, I forgot about what I'll give up. 
I'll never have a first kiss again. 
You'll have a last kiss. 
Can I ask you something? 
Has a guy ever had a crush on you? 
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie? 
A kid in my class said he's in love with me. 
Whoa! 
- Whoa, what? 
- Ross has a boyfriend! 
I do not have a boyfriend. 
There's a guy in one of my classes who has a crush on me. 
- Really? 
- Yeah. Last year, Elizabeth, now this kid.... 
What is it? 
Am I giving out some kind of sexy-professor vibe? 
Not right now. 
The point is, my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm. 
Now I feel bad for the kid. 
I had a crush on a teacher once, and it was so hard. 
I couldn't concentrate. I blushed every time he looked at me. 
You remember what it's like to be 19 and in love. 
- I can cut him some slack. - Yeah. 
- How'd you get over that teacher? 
- I didn't. I got under him. Problem solved. 
- Bye, Phoebe. 
- Okay, bye. 
- All right. 
Bye. - Bye. 
We said goodbye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love. 
It's okay. You don't have to tiptoe around me. 
I've thought about it. You know what? I'm okay, not having that new-relationship feeling. 
- I miss you already! 
- I miss you too! 
That's great, but I wouldn't trade what I have for that. 
I'll be with Chandler the rest of my life. That makes me happy. Come sit down. 
We're talking about how our relationship's deep and meaningful. 
It is, don't you think? 
Oh, totally. Pull my finger. 
- Favorite Returning Male- - 
- This is my category! 
- Got your speech? 
- Got my speech. 
Got your gracious-loser face? 
Try to remember, if you win, you have to hug me. 
Can I squeeze your ass? 
On TV? 
Yeah! 
In the Favorite Returning Male character category, the nominees are : 
John Wheeler from" General Hospital." 
Gavin Graham from The Young and the Restless. 
Duncan Harrington from" Passions." 
And Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives. 
And the Soapie goes to : 
Gavin Graham from The Young and the Restless. 
Presenting the Favorite Supporting Actress award : Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives. 
Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award deserves to take it home. 
Unfortunately, only one can. 
The nominees for Favorite Supporting Actress are : 
From" Passions", Erin Goff. 
From" One Life to Live," Mary Lauren Bishop." All My Children," Sarah Renee. 
And from" Days of Our Lives," Jessica Ashley. 
And the winner is : 
Jessica Ashley from" Days of Our Lives." 
Unfortunately, Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll accept this award on her behalf. 
And I'm sure that Jessica wants to thank my parents who always believed in me. 
She'd also like to thank my friends : 
Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe and Rachel who's sitting right there. 
Why'd we rush out so fast? 
We had to get out of there because- 
- Look what I won! 
Oh, my God. 
You stole her award! 
No, no, no. 
I'm accepting it on her behalf. 
I don't think you know what" behalf" means. Sure I do. 
It's a verb. 
As in" I be half-in' it"! 
- You've got to take this back. 
- I should've won. 
I really wanted it. 
She didn't care enough to come to the thing. 
It could also be a Grammy. 
No, Joey. 
No one saw me take it. 
There's a whole table of them. 
Do you want an award you didn't win? 
No, I want an award I did win. 
But nobody's given me any of those! 
If I put it up, when people come over, they'll see it and think I won it. 
Joey, it says" Best Supporting Actress." 
I can scratch that right off. This is wrong. 
You have to take it back. 
You don't want to win an award this way. 
You're very talented. Someday you'll win one of these for real and that one will mean something. 
- Oh, all right. - All right? 
Thank you. 
I'll take it back tomorrow. 
If I can't have it, you can't have it! 
- Professor Geller? 
- Yes, Mr. Lewis? How can I help you? 
I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff. 
But I was hoping you could change my grade. 
And why, exactly, would I do that? 
Because I'm in love with you. What? 
Yeah. 
I'm all in love with you and stuff. 
- So could you change my grade? 
- No! Why not? 
You changed Ned's grade. 
That's different. 
Because he was actually in love with me. 
No, he's not! 
He's totally yanking your chain. 
He's done this with three other teachers. - What? 
- He's got a girlfriend. 
I can't believe someone would do that for a grade. 
I know. 
It's awful. 
I love you. 
- Have you seen Chandler? 
- No, why? 
I keep thinking about all the things I won't have. It's freaking me out. 
I don't know what to do. 
Don't sweat it. 
Chandler's not around, so get it out of your system. 
That guy's cute. 
Come on, I'm serious. 
- I've got to talk to him about this. 
- That's the last thing you want to do. 
- Why? 
- Because you're marrying him! 
You gotta help me out here. 
I've never been engaged. I've never really been married. 
I can only tell you what my mother told me. 
When you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship don't communicate them to your husband. 
I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm spending the rest of my life with? 
That is correct. 
Yes. 
You're supposed to put all that stuff in a little box in your mind and lock it up. Your mother told you this? 
The woman who married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13? 
Oh, my God, you're right. 
Tell Chandler. 
Hurry, before it's too late! Wait! 
Does this also mean that putting out doesn't get you love? 
- I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley! 
- Wait, wait. 
Rach, please be cool, okay? 
I work with this woman. 
Okay, I'm totally cool. 
Come in. 
Hey, Jessica. 
Hey, Jess. 
This is my friend Rachel. 
- Hi. 
- What's up? 
Here's your Soapie. 
I accepted it for you. 
Oh, my God. 
I won? 
Do you have any idea what this means? 
You're not gonna put it on your shelf or anything? 
No, I try to save that for real awards. 
Now if you'll excuse me? 
- Take it back? 
- Absolutely. 
Yeah, you do! 
Honey? As we get closer to the wedding is there anything you'd like to share? Okay. 
I think the centerpieces are too big. 
You're wrong. 
The centerpieces are fine. 
- Do you ever get scared at all? 
- Kind of. They're really big. 
Doesn't it freak you out that you'll never be with anybody new again? 
What? 
I love you so much. 
Sometimes it bothers me that I'll never have that feeling. 
When you first meet someone and it's new and exciting. 
You know that rush? 
No, when I first meet somebody it's mostly panic, anxiety and a great deal of sweating. 
Okay. 
But you're a guy. 
Aren't you freaked out that you'll never sleep with anybody else? 
Sleeping with somebody, no. 
Anxiety, panic and, I'm afraid, even more sweating. 
Even with me? 
I was dangerously dehydrated the first six months of our relationship. 
For me, the rush is knowing that we'll be together the rest of our lives. 
- Really? 
- Well, yeah. 
Knowing you're having these thoughts, we're back to panic, anxiety and I'll definitely need some kind of sports drink. 
Come here. 
Oh, you don't have to worry. 
Besides, you know what? 
I'll have a lot of new things with you. 
The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. 
Our first grandkid. 
Water. 
Water. Water. 
Mr. Morse? Can I speak to you for a moment? 
That was a great lecture today. 
Did you get a little haircut? 
Yeah, yeah. Do you like it? 
Do you love it? 
I want you to know I'm changing your grade back. 
What? 
Why? 
I know what you're trying to pull here. 
It won't work. 
I'm not trying to pull anything. 
Look, I love you, dude. 
I'm not even gonna talk about this. 
This little" thing" is over. 
I know you have a girlfriend. 
And I know about the other professors. 
How do you think that makes me feel? 
You used me! 
You don't love me and you never did! 
Professor Winston. Professor Frederickson. I'll be right with you. 
Don't make this worse and I'll give you a" C." Shall we? 
I'll be out in a second. 
" It's just so unexpected! 
I'll tell you, it's such an honor to just be nominated for a Nobel Prize. 
And, you know, to win one for a massage! 
Especially just after winning a Tony Award for Best Actress- -" 
Our reservations are at 8. 
" - -in" Reservations at Eight" by Neil Simon. 
Thank you, Neil. Thank you for the words." Finish this later. 
We're gonna be late. 
Please don't play the music. Just one more thing. 
Okay." Live from New York, it's" Saturday Night"!" 
These are the true events of November, 1965. 
The la Drang Valley of Vietnam. 
A place our country does not remember in a war it does not understand. 
This story is the testament to the young Americans who died in the Valley of Death and a tribute to the young men of the People's Army of Vietnam who died by our hand in that place. 
To tell this story, I must start at the beginning. 
But where does it begin? 
Maybe in June of 1 954 when French Group Mobile 1 00 moved into the same Central Highlands of Vietnam where we would go 1 1 years later. 
See anything? 
No, Captain. 
Fucking grass... 
Fucking heat... 
Fucking country... 
Do we take prisoners? 
No. Kill all they send and they will stop coming. 
Maybe the story begins in America when the Army first realized a new kind of war was coming its way. 
The White House anticipates a buildup and wants a victory. Over cavemen, in black pajamas. 
We wouldn't be there if they hadn't already beaten the French Army. 
The French Army? What's that? The problem in Vietnam is terrain. 
Jungle, mountains, rivers, maneuver is a nightmare. 
That's why we came up with the plan to use helicopters. 
Leap in and out of battle. 
They want you to run the test on the idea. It'll take a hell of a combat leader. 
I know a young light Colonel named Hal Moore. 
He led a combat company in Korea. 
After that he volunteered to test experimental parachutes. 
Sounds like just the guy. The other side of the mountain was all that he can see. 
The other side of the mountain was all that he can see. The bear went over the mountain the bear went over the mountain the bear went over the mountain... 
How about we go back to Bingo? - What do you say? 
B-l-N-G-O... 
B-l-N-G-O... 
Tom... How much you know about our new Colonel? 
He was in Korea. 
Has a Masters in international Relations from Harvard. Harvard? 
He's not one of those academic pussies, is he? 
Hal Moore? 
Come on, Too Tall, give me you best shot, baby! 
Did you see that? 
Did you see that? Snakeshit drives that one to the moon. 
To the moon! 
And he's coming around... 
No, he's not... 
You're out, Snakeshit! 
You're out! Horseshit! No wonder you can't fly! 
I believe you're out. 
- You're a pilot? 
- Too Tall, sir. 
- Yeah, I can see that. - You call, we haul. 
- Can I speak to you a minute? 
- Yes, sir. 
- Can I buy you a drink? 
- Sure. 
Oh, thanks. So your men call you, Snakeshit? 
That's an affectionate appellation of my comrades-in-arms, sir. 
Because I fly lower than snakeshit. Well, I gotta problem, Snakeshit. And I think you're the solution. 
I've been called a lot of things, Colonel never a solution. 
You know what Air Cavalry really means? 
You fly into hostile territory, out-numbered. 1 0,000 miles from home. 
Sometimes the battleground's no bigger than a football field. 
And if the choppers stop coming we all get slaughtered. 
Now I figure, chopper pilots won't fly into hell for strangers so... 
-... 
I'm Hal Moore. 
- l know, sir. Why us? 
Well, you guys look like shit. But your equipment is immaculate. 
Yesterday was Sunday, you didn't have to be training but you were. 
And you got pilots like that Too Tall character. 
He's way outside the limits of Army regs they want to fly with you for some reason. 
I guess it's because they think you're the best. It's because I only recruit the dumb ones, sir. 
I suppose that I have a choice in all of this. 
I wouldn't miss it for the world. 
To The Air Cav. 
Good morning, Sergeant-Major. 
How do you know what kind of goddamn day it is? 
Group! 
At ease, Gentlemen! 
Welcome to the new cavalry. 
We will ride into battle. 
And this will be our horse. 
You don't have to catch it. 
You don't have to feed it. 
But I can assure you that neither the new technology nor your status as officers will keep you above the danger. 
Sergeant-Major Plumley and I come from the paratroopers where the officer is always the first one out of the plane because to follow your instincts and to inspire your men by your example you have to be with them where the metal meets the meat. 
Sergeant 
- Major Plumley made all 4 combat jumps in the 82nd Airborne during World War ll. 
Sicily, Salerno, Normandy and Holland plus one more in Korea. 
He answers to me and to me alone. 
Now I hope you Gentlemen like training. 
Because me and the Sergeant-Major we love it. 
Three strikes and you're not out! 
There is always one more thing you can do! 
Go! 
Now! - 2... 
- Let's go! ... 3. 
- Pretty good, no? 
- Pretty good. 
There's only one thing wrong. 
Let's be sharp, men! 
We will be the best platoon in this battalion. Be ready in there! 
Let's go! Alright! Your officer's dead! 
What do you do? 
What do you do? Alright, he hesitated! 
He's dead! What do you do? 
- Get off the chopper! 
Alright, all officers. 
Savage, you learn the job of the man above you. 
And you teach your job to the man below you in rank. 
That goes for every man in this outfit. 
Understood? Yes, Sir! 
Men will die. 
Have you said your prayers? 
No? - No. 
- l'll say them with you. Fall in. 
Alright. 
Ready? Set. In the name of The Father, The Son and The Holy Ghost. 
Amen. 
Hail Mary, full of grace the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb... 
Holy Mary, mother of... 
Cecile, I don't hear you praying, honey. I don't want to be a Catholic. 
I want to be a Methodist like Mommy. You do? 
And why is that, honey? 
So I can pray whatever I want. 
- That's a sin. 
- No, no, that's not a sin. God just made you hardheaded. That's not a sin. 
I'll tell you what, do you want to do you want to pray and thank God for our family? 
- Yes, sir. 
- That's good, then let's do it. Hail Mary, full of grace. 
The Lord is with thee. 
Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. 
I can hear you laughing, you know, even in here. 
I'm not laughing, I'm marveling. 
Marveling? 
About what? That you can find stubbornness in your children and think it comes from anybody but you. 
I'll give you something to marvel at. 
When I pray whatever I want... I thank God for you. 
It's a beautiful morning, Sergeant-Major. 
Are you a fuckin weatherman now? 
Look what I found for the new baseball player. 
They've sent us another bunch of officers. Real green. 
Got to train them up. 
Makes me think of starting a new unit. 
They sent new rifles too. 
The M-1 6. 
It's supposed to be a pretty good weapon. 
Ah, lots of plastic. 
Feels like a B-B gun to me. 
I think I'll stick with my pistol. 
You think we're going to get close enough to the enemy to use that? 
What do you think, sir? A leader must remain cool and calm. 
And second you must learn to ignore the explosions, the heat, the dust the screams of the wounded. 
This is normal on the battlefield. 
... I got wounded... Sir, we need the helicopters over with reinforcements right now... 
Where the hell is that coming from? 
It's our advisors in Vietnam. 
When Crazy Horse was a baby he nursed from the breast of every woman in the tribe. 
The Sioux raised their children that way. 
Every warrior called every woman in the tribe" Mother". 
Every older warrior they called him" Grandfather". And the point here is they fought as a family. 
Take care of your men. 
Teach them to take care of each other. 
Because when this starts each other is all we're going to have. 
- Did you tune that in? 
- Yes, sir. That's fine. 
You're my radio operator. - l... 
Any of you, son-of-a-bitches calls me Grandpa... I'll kill you. 
Godboldt, take your boots off. 
Go on. 
Everybody, take your boots off. 
Everybody. 
I want you to draw out fresh socks from supply and keep your feet dusted with powder. 
Everybody check each other's feet like Godboldt and me. 
Now that young man's a leader. 
Yes, sir. But that other fellow that big strong one there he wants to win medals. 
He's eager. 
Ladies, I'm just really glad that you're all here today. 
I know that some of you are new to the Army, and all of us are new to this post so I thought we could pull our resources and cover whatever questions we might have. 
So why don't we start with item number one : 
... food. If the commissary is out of something where's the best place to shop? 
I tried Big Star, it's okay. 
But I keep thinking my water is going to break right in the checkout aisle. 
So, that takes care of food shopping. 
So, item number two : laundry. 
The base washing machines don't work. 
They're full of sand from the swamp missions. 
- Alright, I'll take care of that. 
- l've already complained. 
Well, we'll just go to the General. In the meantime, the Laundromat in town is okay. 
They won't let you wash colored things in their machines. 
At a public Laundromat? 
But I'm telling you they have a big sign right in the window says," Whites Only". 
- What? - Honey, they mean white people only. 
That's awful. 
Your husband is wearing the uniform of a country that allows a place to say that his laundry's not good enough when he could die for? 
- l'm sorry, I just... 
- That's alright, honey. I know what my husband is fighting for and that's why I can smile. 
My husband would never ask for respect. 
And he'll give respect to no man who hasn't earned it. 
The rest of his family is the same way. And anybody who doesn't respect that can keep his goddamn washing machine because my baby's clothes are going to be clean anyway. 
Well, I guess that takes care of item number two. 
Are you alright? I think... 
I think my water just broke. Okay, we're all calm. 
We're all calm. The car! 
- Colonel. 
- At ease. At ease. I heard one of my new Lieutenant's just became a father. 
I came to say congratulations. - Thank you, sir. 
- l didn't want to disturb you... 
No, no, it's fine. 
It's alright. Please. 
- How's your wife? - She's okay. 
She's okay. She's sleeping. So is my daughter. 
I just wanted to be here for a while before I held her. 
Did you tag her already? 
What does that say? Oh, Camille. 
- l'm sorry, sir. - No, don't you take that off. 
You leave that on where it is. 
That's an order. Colonel, may I ask you a question? 
Sure. What do you think about being a soldier and a father? 
I hope that being good at the one makes me better at the other. 
Why? 
What about you? I don't know, sir. 
Between college and here... 
Barbara and I spent a year in Africa. 
We helped build a school for orphans. 
They were orphans because the War Lord across the border didn't like their tribe. 
I know God has a plan for me. 
I just hope it's to help protect orphans not make any. 
Why don't we ask him? 
Come on, let's go ask him. 
Our Father in Heaven... 
Before we go into battle... Every soldier among us will approach you each in his own way. 
Our enemies too according to their own understanding will ask for protection and for victory. 
And so we bow before your infinite wisdom. We offer our prayers the best we can. 
I pray you watch over the young men like Jack Geoghegan that I lead into battle. 
You use me as your instrument in this awful hell of war to watch over them. 
Especially if they're men like this one beside me deserving of a future in your blessing and good will. 
- Amen. 
Oh, yes... and one more thing, Dear Lord about our enemies ignore their heathen prayers and help us blow those little bastards straight to hell. 
Amen again. 
There is one about the kid with the apple tree or the flying horse, or the fairytale with the deer and stuff on him. 
- Daddy. - Yes? 
The war is... 
Well, it's it's something that shouldn't happen but it does. 
And it is when... 
Some people in another country or any country try to take the lives of other people. 
And then soldiers like your daddy have to, you know... lt is my job to go over there and stop them. 
Are they going to try to take your life away, Daddy? 
Well, yes, Cecile, they are going to try. 
But I'm not going to let them. 
French ln Indo China : 
Did not know the terrain 
Poor intelligence Underestimated the enemy. 
Did not fight on home ground Massacre. 
Can't sleep? 
The men are so young and they sent me a new crop even greener. 
And when I look at them... I see our boys. 
Then you're just the man to lead them. 
I guess. 
We intend to convince the Communist that we cannot be defeated by force of arms. 
I have asked the Commanding General General Westmoreland what more he needs to meet this mounting aggression. 
He has told me. 
And we will meet his needs. I have today ordered to Vietnam the Air Mobile Division. 
And certain other forces which will raise our fighting strength from 75,000 to..... 1 25,000 men almost immediately. 
Additional forces will be needed later... Get out your best dresses, ladies. 
They will want to celebrate. 
Don't you ever be scared. 
Lean on me... I didn't hear the President Mention a State of Emergency. 
No, he didn't. 
Well, without that declaration, it means our enlistments will not be extended. 
I'm sorry, Hal. 
Forgive me, Sir, but let me get this straight. 
We form a division using techniques that have never been attempted in battle against an enemy with 20 years of combat experience on his ground 1 2,000 miles away from our ground. 
And right before the Army sends us into the fight they take away a third of my men. 
The most experienced third, including the officers. 
I don't like it any better than you do, Hal. Hell, no! 
You saw this coming, didn't you...? Yes. 
That's why you gave me that new crop of platoon leaders. Korea didn't teach them anything. 
Thrill me. Thank you, Sir. 
By the way, Hal, since we're being deployed they're renumbering the units. 
You're now the Commanding Officer of the 1 st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry. 
The 7th? 
Thank you, Sir. 
Look around you. 
In the 7th Cavalry we've got a Captain from the Ukraine another from Puerto Rico we got Japanese, Chinese, Blacks Hispanics, Cherokee Indians Jews and Gentiles all Americans. 
Now here in the States... 
Some men in this unit may experience discrimination because of race or creed. 
But for you and me now all that is gone. 
We're moving into the Valley of the Shadow of Death. 
Where you will watch the back of the man next to you as he will watch yours. 
And you won't care what color he is or by what name he calls God. 
They say we're leaving home. 
We're going to what home... 
Was always supposed to be. So let us understand the situation. 
We are going into battle against a tough and determined enemy. 
I can't promise you that I will bring you all home alive. 
But this I swear before you and before almighty God that when we go into battle I will be the first to set foot on the field and I will be the last to step off and I will leave no one behind. 
Dead or alive we will all come home together so help me God. 
I love you. 
Central Highlands, South Vietnam, 1 965 
HEADQUARTERS 1 ST battalion 7TH U.S. CAVALRY regiment 
- Hal. 
- Sir. 
Last night the enemy hit our camp at Plaei Me. 
- How many casualties? - None. 
The enemy forces withdrew from this mountain near the Cambodian border. How many men do you have battle-ready, give or take? 
- Sergeant Major? 
- 395, Sir. Exactly. 
What do you estimate the enemy strength? 
We appraise their numbers as manageable, Colonel. 
You have no idea. 
We have no idea. 
Simple orders, Hal. 
Find the enemy and kill him. They attack us... no casualties. 
Then they run and hide in the mountains. 
Naturally we chase them of course. 
Does it smell like an ambush to you? They get close enough to kill us we'll be close enough to kill them. 
Round trip per chopper, 30 minutes. 
That means the first 60 men on the ground will be there a half hour alone. 
Son-of-a-bitch. 
I think maybe you ought to get yourself an M-1 6. When time comes I need one, they'll be plenty of them lying on the ground. 
It was a Sunday, 
November 1 4th 1 965. 
Before that day, the soldiers of North Vietnam and those of America never met each other in a major battle. 
Two miles out. 
The helicopter soldiers are coming! 
It's a scout! 
Let's take him prisoner! 
There he goes! Come on! 
Come on! Captain, I want you to keep contact with all patrols. 
Hey... I got something here! I got a boy! 
- He say he deserter. - Bullshit, he's a lookout. 
Hey say this is base camp for whole division. 
Same army that destroyed French. 
He say they want to kill Americans very badly. Just not been able to find any yet. Captain Metsker tell all the patrols to hold their positions. 
You, take the radio! 
Captain, you call in all the patrols. 
We have to regroup and engage the enemy all the way from the LZ... 
Net call. Net call. 
This is Trojan-Two... Grab the wounded! 
Fall back! 
Get the high ground! Get off there! 
Down! Check your ammo! 
Come on! I'll get us out of here. 
Grab the wounded! We'll make a run for it! Sarge? 
Sarge! 
We got to get out of here! Stay down! 
Stay down! 
Form a perimeter! 
Conserve your ammo and stay down! 
1 : 1 5 P.M. The Knoll. 
Trojan Two... come in! 
Over! Hey! Hey! 
Pull the chain on all the firepower you can get on that mountain! 
Alert Crandall, we have a hot LZ! 
Agent Serpent Six, this is Trojan Two. 
You're coming into a hot LZ! 
We are taking fire! Repeat! We are taking fire! 
No shit! 
Shift immediately to their flanks. 
Do not let them breathe! Roger that. Trojan-Two out. 
Herrick's platoon is cut off and under attack! 
Bravo Company's holding! 
Move! - We got to go! 
Sir...? 
Don't let them get the signals codes... 
I'm glad I could die for my country. 
Bungum... 
Tell my wife I love her. 
Niner-3-3-0-1... 
Ernie! 
Ernie help! 
We got more coming! 
Copy. We are cutoff. 
They are using artillery as a shied! 
It is accurate, and continuous. 
We must overrun them now, when they are at their weakest! 
Attack here here, and here! 
Overwhelm the landing zone and we have choked their route of supply and escape! 
It's a hot LZ! 
They're trying to break right through us! 
I want you to reinforce Alpha Company, there! Yes, Sir! 
Now! Move! Follow me! 
Doc! The wounded are over by that termite mound! Go! 
Follow me! 
Radio! Sir! 
Captain Edwards on the ridge! 
Bob! 
Colonel, these guys are regulars! 
Heavily armed! AK-47's and pouches of grenades! 
Heavy machine guns and shoulder-fired rockets! 
Have we broken through? 
The Americans just landed another wave of reinforcements. 
They massed precisely where we attacked 
Use the creek bed. Captain Nadal! 
That creed bed is vital! 
Vital! - They'll be coming right at you! 
- Do not let them flank! 
I repeat, do not let them flank! 
Tom! 
Tom... 
Tom? I'm alright. 
Charlie, come here! 
I want you to get me all the air support you can get me on that mountain! 
Now! Now! 
Requesting immediate close air support. I need you to burn them out on hilltop. 
Alpha, shift to Alpha Bravo. 
Give me something higher up on that. 
Medevac Command of the 7th Cavalry, are you inbound? 
Looks pretty hot down there. 
It is a little hot. Just watch our approach. 
Follow us in. 
You see that? 
Snake! Get out of here! 
Okay! 
Here! They're still trying to flank us! 
Radio! Trojan Six! 
We are in heavy contact! 
In danger being overrun! 
If they get into the LZ, we all had it. 
Crandall. 
This is Trojan Six. 
It's too hot down here. 
I'm closing the LZ. - You copy that, Too Tall? 
- Copy that, Snake. U.S. lntelligence Headquarters Saigon I don't like it. 
First time out, a whole battalion massacred. 
- You think this is a massacre? 
- l call losing a lot of draftees a bad week. 
Losing a Colonel is a massacre. 
Moore is still fighting. 
He's under strength against more men than he can count. 
They're only cut off and surrounded. 
Then they're lost. 
- Sergeant-Major! - Sir! 
We need to carve out an emergency LZ right over there! 
Colonel, this is Snakeshit and Too Tall. 
We're coming in with 2 full loads of ammo. Crandall, we've blown a new LZ. 
Out. 
Colonel, it's Battalion headquarters. 
They want you out! - We can't get out, damnit! 
- Not all of us... just you. 
Saigon wants to debrief you! 
Too Tall, follow the Colonel to the new LZ. 
Shit! - We will give you a hand. - We are moving on board. 
Alright, get the ammo off! 
No! No! 
It's, Ray! 
He's hurt worse than me! 
You, me and Ouellette are all we have in reserve. 
Yeah, it's slacking' up a little. 
We just regroup for another assault. 
Distribute that ammo. - Ouelette! - Yes, Sir! 
Yes, sir. Agent Serpent Six, this is Trojan Six... 
Doc! 
Give this water to the wounded. 
Everybody's out of water. It must be terrible for them. 
3 : 34 P.M. 
- The Knoll Running low on ammo, Sarge! Pick your target. 
One shot, one kill, alright? 
How are we doin', Doc? We're out of water. 
My face is on fire! Foster, hold still! 
Okay! 
- Are you hit? - No, no, I'm okay. 
Our guys are going to come for us, aren't they? 
Yes. When? 
Plug his wound. 
That's the main LZ, but it's closed. 
Crandall's clear. 
I want you to go over there and reinforce your Company. - Yes, sir! - Okay! 
To the top of the ridge! 
Move! Move! 
We got to breakthrough to that cut-off platoon. 
We got an American platoon out there. 
An Air Cav platoon cut-off out there! 
Air Cav! Air Cav! Air Cav! 
Hey, good luck to you. 
- lf you're crazy enough. Get in. - Yes, sir. 
Enemy soldiers. They use candles on the trail. 
They're moving into position to attack. 
Here we go! 
Let's go! 
That is the last flight for tonight, Colonel. 
But if you need us, you call us. - Who the hell are you? 
- l'm a reporter, Sir. 
Joe Galloway, U.P.l. How is it going, Colonel? 
We've been flat to the boards since last night. 
We got more enemy coming too. 
- Yes, sir. 
- l can't guarantee your safety. 
Yes, sir, I know - Where you from, son? 
- Refugio, Texas, Sir. 
That's the first thing I've heard all day that makes any sense. 
- Captain Dillon. - Sir! - Did you see those lights. 
- l'm on it right now, sir. You fry them son-of-a-bitches. 
Risky-Six. This is Trojan-Three. 
Fire emissions. Angle foxtrot : four-niner-six-five-six-niner... 
Plane operations are scheduled for zero-five-thirty hour. 
- He's right there, sir. Crandall. 
You led my men into a hot LZ. 
Yes, somebody had to fly out the wounded. No, no, don't you play hotshot with me! 
You know the rules. 
You suckered us in there. 
If you ever do it again, I'm going to have you busted! You got the balls to face me but not to face the enemy! 
Get out! If I ever see you again, I'll kill you. 
That's right. 
If they make it to tomorrow. 
Dead bodies stink. 
No, it's not the dead ones. I can smell them crawling up on us. 
I'm telling you. 
I need illumination 6-5-0 1 - 5-0-1. 
I need artillery on previously established targets. Alpha, Bravo and Charlie. Fire for effect! 
Fire for effect! Save the ammo! 
Cease fire! is anybody hit? 
Captain, if you guys are coming, you gotta let us know. 
It's pitch black out here. I don't want to shoot any of our own guys. 
Savage we can't make it tonight. 
Don't worry, you're going to make it. 
We'll come get you in the morning. 
Yes, sir. 
Out. 
Don't worry. We gave them more than they gave us today. 
Keep it up. 
- How're you boys doing? - Fine, sir. 
Keep it up. 
Keep doing what you're doing and you'll be fine. Your men have done a hell of a job today... 
- Lieutenant Geoghegan... - They won't get through us, sir. 
- You can count on it. 
- l know that, Jack. Keep it up, son. 
- lt's Rear Headquarters, sir. 
- How is it out there, Colonel? We're surrounded but we're holding on, Sir. 
Sir, I need a confirmed count of our dead and wounded. 
I got to know where all my boys are. 
You'll get it, Hal. 
I need illumination on the perimeter. 
This is Howard-six-alpha. I need illumination. 
Now. 
Cathy? 
A cab delivers a telegram. 
The Secretary of the Army... 
... re regrets... 
Colonel Moore's wife? 
Yes. 
I need help finding an address. 
- l am looking for... - You jackass! 
Do you know what this is? 
Do you know what you just did to me? 
I'm just trying to do it. 
And tell the cab company if there are any others just bring them to me. 
I just went by to see Catherine. Everybody knows. 
No chaplains or counselors. 
Cab drivers! The Army wasn't ready. 
I'll go with you. 
- Thanks. - Who's it for? 
Your husband didn't start the war. 
They all knew this could happen, and so did we. 
I'll go with you. 
Okay? We won't look, okay? 
Okay. 
Do you think they'll bring more telegrams tomorrow? 
In the name of The Father, The Son and The Holy Ghost. Amen. Out of the depths I cry to thee Lord. 
Lord hear my voice. 
May thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications. 
... thou, O Lord, shall mark our inequities. 
Lord, who can abide them? 
Grant them eternal rest, O Lord... 
And make a perpetual light shine upon them. And trough the mercy of God, may they rest in peace. 
Amen. ln the name of The Father The Son and The Holy Ghost. 
No, sir. Then why are you here? 
Because I knew these dead boys will be here, sir. 
You got the guts for it. 
My daddy was a soldier. 
My granddaddy, two of my great granddaddies were soldiers. 
Hell, that's how I came to be. 
See, each of them lost a leg in the Civil War. 
My great granddaddy Galloway he lost his left. 
And my great granddaddy Reid lost his right. 
And they met in a shoe store in Galveston every year after that that, the same date, the same store they would get together and pick out a brand new pair of shoes for the two of them. 
No, sir, I swear to God. 
One had a daughter, one had a son, my grandparents. 
What the hell do you suppose the odds of them having the same shoe size was? 
I don't know, Colonel. 
It was meant to be, I guess. 
Meant to be. 
Sir, Galloways have been in every war this country has ever fought. 
But when it came to this one I didn't think I could stop the war. 
You know, I just thought that maybe. 
And maybe help folks back home understand. 
I just figured I could do that better shooting a camera than I could shooting a rifle. 
You too, Colonel. 
We fought well today. 
We tested their tactics and learned their capabilities. 
Their artillery is effective so we must get so close they can't use it. 
We will grab them by the belt buckle. 
For the courage of those who have died... 
For those who are about to die... I am grateful. 6 : 09 A.M. The Creed Bed 
Colonel, sir. 
- Nadal. 
Except there's nothing wrong. 
You'll be fine. Go on! Roger that, sir. 
Pass the word on. 
Every man fire 3 rounds at anything looks suspicious to them. On my signal. 
They're gonna hit us like this on the whole perimeter. We gotta get back to termite mound. 
Stay here till it stops. 
Captain Edwards. Charlie Company... 
-... on the ridge. - Bob? 
They're inside the artillery! I need... Bob? 
Bob? 7 : 1 5 A.M. 
- The Ridge 
I need a grenade! 
Godboldt's down! I'll get him! 
Captain Dillon, I want you to get Bravo Company to send up a platoon across the LZ support Charlie Company! 
Bravo-six. This is Trojan three. Bravo-six. 
This is Trojan three... And tell Charlie Company to get real small in their holes! 
I'm going to drop some artillery right on top of them! 
Charlie Company. 
We've rounds coming right into your position. 
We're being overrun! 
Now, boys, we're going to win this fight. 
They have brought a main course VC battalion against us too. 
I'm requesting that you dispatch another company of reinforcements for movement as soon as it can be accomplished. 
How bad is it, Hal? 
It's getting pretty sporty down here, sir. 
Get out of the way! 
Medic! 
Get a medic over here! 
Jimmy Nakayama! 
I got a baby being born today! 
- Congratulations! - Thanks. 
You can't take no pictures lying down there, sonny. Down. 
Sir, I'm a non-combatant, sir. Ain't no such thing today, boy. 
Why aren't those mortars firing? What's the problem here? 
I'm afraid we're going to cook a round off and blow us all up! 
And we can't cool them off cause we're all out of water! 
Gentlemen prepare to defend yourselves. 
We are through their lines on all sides. 
Congratulations, Colonel. 
You have beaten the Americans. Negative. Negative. 
Stand by. Any pilots do not see the enemy. 
They do no pick out our friendlies. 
Bravo-six, say again, do you read? 
You got to tell your Company Commander to pop smoke now. They need to mark the lines, right now! 
He has no lines! 
Stand by. We cannot see the target. 
Our perimeter is collapsing. 
Half of Company Bravo is coming down. 
Charlie Company is being overrun! 
Broken Arrow! Broken Arrow! 
I say it again! 
Broken Arrow! Broken Arrow! 
- Confirm, Broken Arrow. - Broken Arrow. Confirmed. 
- That means an American unit is being overrun. 
It calls in every combat aircraft for support. 
My God, there's not hiding it now. 
Charlie Company! Report! Bravo Company! 
Report! Planes are on their way, Colonel! 
Sir! 
We have planes stacked up at every 1, 000 feet from 7,000 to 35,000! We'll get them, sir! 
Advancing coords to our position. 
Right? One-five-zero... 
Nine-six-two-five-zero-seven... 
You are getting closer in on zero-five-zero degrees. Repeat, zero-five-zero... 
Company of enemy out in the open is facing north on our position. 0-5-0 grados. 
at 1-5-0. 
We're getting closer in on 3-1-5 degrees al 0-5-0... 
Call that son-of-a-bitch off! Abort! 
Pull up! 
Charlie! Listen to me! You're keeping us alive now. 
You forget about that one! 
And you keep them coming in! You're doing well, son. 
Seven-O-Two, attack against the tree line. 
Medic! 
Jimmy! 
Do you know this guy? You know him, talk to him. 
Just talk to him! Jimmy... 
do you hear me? It's Joe. Joe Gallowway. 
We're going to get you out of here. 
We got to get him to the landing zone. Grab his legs. 
You got to get him out of here. I can't help you! 
You got to do it by yourself! 
- Get him on that chopper! Okay? 
- Yes, sir. 
Tell my wife I love her and my baby. 
You tell them... 
- Captain Nadal. - Sir. 
Now we put them back in our heels. 
We got us a lull. 
I want you to attack... 
I want you to go in there and rescue that cutoff platoon. Yes, sir. First Squad! 
Move out! 
Keep moving the artillery forward! Move it! 
Keep moving forward! 
Sergeant Savage... you guys still here? 
That's a nice day, Sergeant Savage. 
And 2 unaccounted for, sir. Right. 
All right, boys, let's get them up! 
Get them out! 
Get them on the chopper! 
Alright, since most of the men being loaded on the chopper is Charlie Company, I want you to take their place. 
I'll show you where to start. Yes, sir. 
Let's go. 
Captain, you have your men dig in some firing steps. 
When it's over throw some dirt on those bodies. -... - Right, Sergeant Major. 
It kind of makes you wish you had signed up for the submarines? 
Colonel, Brigade headquarters wants you lifted out on the first chopper at dawn. Now, what idiot would keep ordering that in the middle of a goddamn battle? 
General Westmoreland wants a briefing. 
I am in a fight and I object to this order to return to Saigon. 
Now I will not leave my men. is that clear? Out. 
There's two of my men unaccounted for out there and it's where the worst the fighting was so they will be out there some place. 
Let's go and get them, what do you say? - l'm with you, sir. 
- Alright... Let's go. 
They brought another... 
No, God, Julie. Julie, it's yours... No. 
Keeping my promise. 
Sir, they're ordering us all out. All of us. 
They're going to march reinforcements in. 
They don't understand a damn thing, do they? 
Can't get out. 
He's waiting up there in a cave and that's what he wants. 
The minute he sees live soldiers hopping on the helicopter he will be all over us, and then he'll get wants... 
He'll get his massacre. 
Requesting permission to rejoin the lines, sir. 
Alright, son. 
Carry on, sir. 
I wonder what was going through Custard's mind when he realized he led his men into a slaughter. 
Sir, Custer was a pussy. 
You ain't. 
Goddamn... 
Right now they are planning their final attack. One that is going to finish us off. 
They will nibble at us all night, then... 
That's what I would do if I was him. 
Sergeant-Major... -... hand out the last ammunition. - Yes, sir. 
Use the darkness to move into position and I will bring up our reserves. 
We will overwhelm them at dawn before they are ready. 
5 : 57 A.M. The Third Day 
Fix bayonets. 
You were wondering how Custer felt, sir. You ought to ask him. 
The Americans have broken through our lines. 
We have no soldiers between them and our command post. 
Sergeant Savage! 
Checking the dead enemies for documents I found this on the guy who tried to bayonet you. 
Translated some of it, mostly personal. 
I thought you might want to have a look at it. 
- Joe! - Joe! 
- lt's American artillery. 
- Friendly fire. 
- How many casualties? 
What the hell happened to you, Joe? 
Colonel Moore! Colonel Moore! 
What was the key to your victory, Colonel? Sir, tell us how you feel. 
Do you feel the United States will be forced to take the North Vietnamese more seriously now? 
How do you feel about the lost of your men, sir? 
Have you notified the families, sir? 
I'm glad you made it, son. 
Thank you, sir. 
You too. 
I'll never forgive myself. 
For what, sir? 
That my men that my men died and I didn't. 
Sir, I don't... I don't know how to tell this story. 
Well, you got to, Joe. 
You tell the American people what these men did here. 
You tell how my troopers died. 
Yes, sir. 
Thank you. 
All of our men, living and dead are off the field, sir. Well done, Sergeant-Major. 
Such a tragedy. 
They will think this was their victory. 
So this will become an American war. 
And the end will be the same except for the numbers who will die before we get there. 
In Saigon, Hal Moore's superiors congratulated him for killing over 1,800 enemy soldiers. 
Then ordered him to lead the men of the 7 th Cavalry back into battle again. 
He led them and fought beside them for 235 more days. 
Kids, go to bed. 
Isn't there someone at the door? 
Go to bed! 
Children! 
Your daddy's home! 
- Daddy! 
Some had families waiting. 
For others, their only family would be the men they had bled beside. 
There we no bands no flags no honor guards to welcome them home. 
They went to war because their country ordered them to. 
But in the end they fought not for their country or their flag. 
They fought for each other. 
Dear Barbara... I have no words to express to you my sadness over the lost of Jack. 
The world is a lesser place without him. 
But I know he is with God and the angels. 
But even heaven has improved by his presence there. 
I know you too are sure of this, and yet this knowledge can't diminish his lost and your grief. 
With abiding respect and affection... Hal Moore. 
We who have seen war we'll never stop seeing it. 
In the silence of the night we will always hear the screams. 
So this is our story. 
For we were soldiers once and young. 
The Names of the men of the 7 th Cavalry who died in the la Drang Valley are remembered on Panel 3-East of the Vietnam War Memorial. 
To their left and right are the names of 58,000 of their brother-in-arms. 
These are the names of those who died at LZ X-Ray. 
The city of Townsville is in some serious serious, serious trouble! 
Day after day crime, lawlessness and evil are running rampant. 
Its citizens have lost all hope. 
They are utterly helpless and in desperate need of a true hero. 
But who? 
Is there no one who can help this forsaken town and make it a better place? 
Fear not, fair viewers, for there is a man, a man of science a forward-thinking man, who looks back to a sweeter time when there was spice to life, and everything was... nice. 
I must profess, sir this man holds the ingredients to Townsville' s salvation! 
This man, known simply as : 
The Professor. 
Hi! 
What's your name? 
My name is Professor. 
Professor Utonium. 
Hello! 
Hello, Professor Utonium. 
It's very nice to meet you. 
It's very nice to meet you too. 
- What are your names? 
. - You made us, so shouldn't you name us? 
. 
Okay. 
This is so cool! 
Well, now, let's see. 
Because of your directness and opening right up to me, I think I'll call you Blossom. 
Well, aren't you all cute and bubbly! 
You'll be my little Bubbles. That's it! 
So we have Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup. 
Because it also begins with a B. 
And together you are three perfect little g- - 
Gifts! 
Birthday! 
It's your birthday! 
I should get gifts! 
Wow! 
I wanted to make some kids I could teach right from wrong and in turn, maybe they'd do good for this town, and now I can! 
All I gotta do is be a good parent. 
Note to self :. 
Good parents don't leave kids alone. 
Sugar, spice and everything nice. 
Who knew that's what girls were made of! 
I can't believe I made perfect girls! 
Three normal little gi- - 
You should be careful when coming down the steps! 
You could get hurt. 
Hey, are these for us? . 
Thanks, Professor! 
- Hey, thanks! 
- Yes, Professor! 
Thank you. 
This is the best gift ever Dad. 
Yes, it is. 
Okay, girls, now watch me. 
I think you missed a spot. 
I'll go wash up, then we'll bring in the furniture. 
Girls, wait! 
You should let me- - 
Help? . 
This looks pretty good. 
What do you think? . 
- I think it's a little dark. 
- I like it dark. 
- Some windows might be nice. 
- Yeah! 
I could see some windows. 
Right about here. 
I'll call a contractor tomor- - 
Or that works too. 
Who's hungry? . 
- Ready? . 
- Ready! 
Go! 
Okay, girls. 
Time for- - 
Bed. 
- Wake up, girls! 
Time for school. 
- What's school? . 
This is school. 
I'm your teacher, Ms. Keane and this is where kids come to learn. 
See? . 
You wanna play? . 
Do you think they'll be okay? . 
I'm new at this parenting thing, and I wanted to meet you because they're really special. 
I mean, really special and I just want to make sure they'll be okay. 
Do you think they'll be okay? . 
They'll be just fine, Professor. 
We'll see you at noon. 
Okay. 
Bye, girls. 
Bye. 
Bye. 
Bye-bye. 
Bye. 
Bye. 
Okay, class. Take your seats. 
- Can Blossom sit with us? 
. - Can we sit with Bubbles? . 
Can Buttercup sit here? . 
The girls can sit right in the middle, so they'll be next to everyone. 
Now, let's begin! 
Hello, Professor. 
Right on time. 
Your girls are outside with the others. 
Oh, no! 
Look at this mess. 
I knew the girls would be a handful, but I'm so sorry. 
What, this? . 
This is what happens when you put 20 kids in one room. 
Your girls were perfect. 
Perfect, normal, well-behaved little girls. 
- Nothing out of the ordinary? 
. - No. Like what? 
- That was sweet! 
- What's the point of this game, anyway? . 
Tag! 
You're it! 
Everyone's running from her like she's been infected! 
- Maybe she's a freak. 
- Yeah, and they hate her! 
- You're it! 
- Tag! 
You're it! 
Oh, no! 
I've been affected! 
- All right, what's going on here? 
. - I've been affected! 
You're not infected, it's just a game. 
- lt is? . 
- Yeah. 
- A game? 
. Neat! 
- Yeah, how do we play? . 
Okay, look, it's very simple. 
Bubbles, tag me. 
Come on, it's okay. 
All right, now I'm it. 
And all you gots to do to play is tag someone else, and they're it. 
By the way, you're it! 
Awesome, I'm it! 
What do I do? 
. What do I do? . 
Just tag someone else, and they're it! 
Time to put it into overdrive, Bubbles! 
Tag! 
You're it! 
I'm gonna tag you guys now. 
You missed us! 
- Tag! 
You're it! 
- No! 
No, I'm not! 
Tag! 
You're it! 
Tag! 
Missed me! 
No, you're it! 
Tag! 
I'm it? 
. 
Tag! 
Tag! 
Got you! 
- Got you! 
- Missed me! 
Girls, no! 
Wait! 
Can't catch me! 
Oh, no! 
Subway, huh? . 
Tag. 
You're it. 
There they- - 
Here she comes! 
Suckers. 
Tag. 
You're it. 
You know, I've got a nice car. 
- You're it. 
- No, you're it! 
Hey! 
She'll never find us up here. 
Do you hear something? . 
Run! 
Tag! 
You're both it! 
Hey! 
- We can't both be it. 
- Why not? . 
- Tag. 
- What? 
. I can't be it twice! 
- Why not? . 
- Okay then. 
Tag. 
Now you guys are it. 
- Tag. 
- Tags. 
- Hey, no tag backs! 
Tag! 
- Tag! 
- Tag! 
- Tag! 
- Tag! 
- Tag! 
- Tag! 
- Tag! 
- You're it! 
- You're it! 
Oh, boy. 
Oh, boy. 
Oh, boy. 
Oh, boy. 
Oh, boy. 
Mayor, the town is being destroyed by three girls with freakish powers. 
This is a very serious situation. 
What action should we take? . 
- Tag, tag! 
- Tag, tag, tag! 
Don't worry. 
We have the situation under control. 
- Oh, boy. 
- I know, sir. 
- Oh, boy. 
- You tell them, Mayor. 
Townsville will not stand for this. 
Mayor? . Hello? 
City being destroyed? 
- Where are you going? 
. - Oh, boy. 
Mayor, where are you going? . 
We're in a serious pickle. 
Exactly. 
Girls, no! 
Hello. 
Hello. 
The usual, Cucor. 
I have a fine vintage for you here. 
Picked fresh today. 
Oh, boy! 
Girls, girls, are you okay? . 
Tag! 
You're it, Professor! 
Okay, girls. 
Girls, it's almost bedtime, okay? 
. Girls? . 
Come on, Professor, you're it. 
You gotta catch us. 
Yes, I suppose I do, don't I? . 
Got you, you little bunny. 
Help! 
I got caughted! 
Blossom, watch out! 
You're the sole survivor! 
No way, Professor! 
You can't catch me. 
Yes, I can because the game's over, and it's your bedtime. 
Now come up here so we can catch you. 
Well now, three little girls had a very busy day today, didn't they? . 
Yeah, it was fun. 
We met lots of kids. 
- And we learned things. 
- And we played tag! 
I'm glad you had so much fun because tomorrow will be busy too. 
Put your nighties on and get in bed. 
We need to talk about something. 
- Okay, everybody in? 
. - Yep, what's up, Daddy-o? . 
Well, it's your super powers. 
I'm not sure how to say this but I don't think you should use them in public anymore. 
Why? . 
Well, your powers are very special and unique and although we have a lot of fun doing things in the house out in Townsville, people don't understand how special you girls are. 
And unfortunately, people often get scared or angry when they don't understand something special or unique. 
That's silly. 
I think so too, but nonetheless, take it easy with the powers tomorrow. 
Just give Townsville a little time to understand your specialness, okay? . 
- Okay. 
- Okay. 
- Yeah. 
- People are nice. 
Things will be fine. 
So I'll be waiting here to pick you up when school gets out, okay? . 
Okay, but don't worry, Professor. 
Things are gonna be fine. 
Girls, we didn't know if you'd be joining us today. 
Take your seats. 
I'm sorry to say there won't be any recess for a while due to all the reconstruction. 
Secondly, I'm afraid we won't have any lights or water for a while. 
And a broken refrigerator means snack-time is out so let's try to ignore all the workmen and noise and such and get right to work, shall we? 
Girls, can you recite the alphabet for us? . 
Girls? 
. ABCs? 
. 
A, B, C, D.... 
E! 
F.... 
Almost time to pick up the girls. 
That's him, boys! 
He's in cahoots with the evil pickle-cart killers cucumber crushers, vinegar varlets, dill-stroyers! 
Why, it's not kosher! 
It's- - 
Let it go, Mayor. 
Let it go. 
- Are these your babies? . 
- Yes, but they were just playing. 
They're really very good little girls. 
And I need to pick them up from school. 
I understand, sir but we want you to come downtown with us to ask you a few questions. 
You guys, my kids. 
I really ought to pick them up. 
I can't just leave them there alone. 
He's not coming. 
He hates us. 
He totally hates us. 
No, he probably just got held up, or maybe the car broke or maybe he forgot or maybe he hates us. 
Come on, let's try and find our way home. 
We're not supposed to use our powers. 
Come on, girls. 
The cause? 
Three super powered little girls. 
Should manufacturing super powered children be illegal? 
A great travesty has befallen our beloved city. 
I was easing the seat back when this atomic punk flies in with no warning. 
The devastation? 
Devastating. 
It should be illegal. 
Used to be a time when you could buy an honest pickle. 
They were lighting up the sky. 
Estimated dollars in damages? 
A whopping 25 million. 
I'm offended just looking at them. 
The kind that you can only find at a pickle cart. 
Now Jamie's crying. 
- Well, it seems that- - 
- Hatred is running rampant for- - 
- Those mutant, bug-eyed- - - Pickle-cart killing- - 
Freaks. 
Back to you, Linda. 
They are little freaks, aren' t they? 
With more on this subject is- - 
Get them out. 
We don't need them. 
We don't need them. 
We interrupt this program for a news flash. 
Arrested in connection with the tag incident was the scientist responsible for creating the girls, Professor Utonium. 
Upon incarceration, the Professor made this statement : 
Please, just let me go. 
My girls, they need me. 
They don't know I'm in jail. 
What if they try to go home themselves? 
They can't find their way if they don't fly. 
Please, they're only little girls who are probably cold, scared and maybe even lost. 
Well, it' s official. 
I have no idea where we are. 
Well, I can't say it's been the best day. 
But it probably couldn't get much worse. 
Hey, it's okay. 
Maybe there's a box we can get in around back. 
Come on. 
See, there's a whole bunch of boxes. 
What's the matter? . 
Did somebody get lost? . 
Wow, thanks! 
Hey, wait! 
Come back. 
Hey, guys, over here. 
- Hi. 
What's your name? . 
I'm Blossom. 
- Buttercup. 
And I'm Bubbles. 
Go away, please. 
Do not look at me. 
We just wanted to thank you for saving us from those gangsters. 
That was amazing with the trashcan lid. 
It was all : swoosh, bang, splash, bam, boom. 
Yeah, you rock. 
No, please. 
I dare not listen for I have been lashed by harsh tongues for too long. 
Alas, my little ones, I do not rock. 
For I, Jojo, am a monster. 
You're not a monster. 
Monsters are evil. 
Anybody who would save us like you did is so not evil. 
You're no monster, mister. 
You're just really dirty. 
Please. 
You're just trying to make me feel better. 
But my pain is not for you to understand. 
Besides, how could you? . 
For you are pure and innocent and, most certainly, loved. 
How could you know what it is to be cast out into a world that only offers misery? 
How could you know what it's like for people to fear and despise you for the very things that make you special because you don't fit in, because you are a freak? 
.! 
Because we're freaks too. 
- What amazing powers! 
- No, they're terrible. 
- I bet everyone hates them. 
- Yeah. 
- And they hate you too. 
- Yes. 
I am in the same boat. 
This brain is full of brilliant ideas. 
But will anyone listen? . 
No. 
Nothing in this gray matters. 
So, what's the point? . 
Jojo, don't be sad. 
Our dad says people get angry when they don't understand something special or unique. 
If you just give people time, they'll start to understand your specialness. 
Yeah. 
You just gotta believe in yourself. 
If I construct my Help-the-town - and-make-it-a-better-place machine people will come to understand my specialness? 
I'll do it, but I'll need your help. 
Jump in, take this device into the volcano. 
We need to harness the energy of the Earth's core for power. 
- What are you talking about? 
. - The plan. 
- What plan? 
. - Our plan. 
- To do what? . 
- To make the town better. 
- What? 
. - You know. 
We will build the Help-the-town - and-make-it-a-better-place machine. 
Everyone will see our special abilities are good. 
They will love us. 
Remember? 
. It was your idea. 
Oh, yeah. 
But use our powers? . 
- Yes. 
- No way. 
- Come on. 
- No. 
We're never using our powers again. 
Girls, don't be sad. 
Your powers are great. 
You just gotta believe in yourself. 
Yes! 
Yes! 
Yes! 
- We did good? . 
- You did very good. 
Very good indeed. 
- Now what do we do? . 
- We construct the superstructure. 
Look. 
Can't you see our plan is working? . 
Our work is proceeding as planned. 
At last, our lives will be better. 
At last, we will be accepted. 
At last, our greatest work is comple- - 
- Oops. - What's wrong? 
. 
Well there is one last teeny-tiny, itsy-bitsy thing we still need. 
Yes! 
Yes! 
Yes! 
- We did good? . 
- You did very good. 
Very good indeed. 
Now what do we do? . 
Well, because you've done so good I've got a special surprise. 
- Worthless. 
- Lame. 
- Stupid. 
- Okay. 
- Better. 
- Almost. 
Awesome! 
Come, girls, our work is fin- - 
I mean, time to go. 
But, Jojo.... 
- We haven't seen the gazelles. 
- Or the crocodiles. 
Or the unicorns. 
Just one unic- - 
Excuse me, ma'am. I think you dropped this. 
I thought the zoo kept all the animals in cages. 
Yeah, well, you're welcome, lady. 
Don't listen, Bubbles. 
That's right, Bubbles, do not listen. 
All of you, deafen yourselves to their heartless words. 
They do not know it is their saviors they are speaking to. 
They are unaware your actions will have helped change their world forever. 
Because we have helped the town and made it a better place. 
- You think they'll be surprised? . 
- Oh, yeah. 
Will they still be mad at us for playing tag? . 
No, they'll have forgotten all about that. 
Will they love us? . 
Yes. 
- Really? . 
- Would I lie to you? . 
- I'm so excited! 
- We'll show them! 
Hey, where's- -? 
. 
Professor! 
Girls, thank goodness you're okay. 
I'm so sorry. 
I'm a terrible, terrible parent. 
You must hate me for not picking you up from school, but it's not my fault. 
It's this town. 
They've gone crazy. 
It's like they've never seen kids playing before. 
I knew your powers would take some getting used to. 
But jail? 
. Lawsuits? . 
Angry mobs? . 
What's next? . 
Don't worry, Professor. 
Things are gonna get better. 
We promise. 
- Today's the day. 
- Today's the day! 
Today's the day! 
- Today's- - 
- The day. 
- What to wear? . 
- What to wear? . 
That's nice. 
Professor, wake up! 
Wake up. 
- Wake-- 
- Up. 
Wake up, my brothers. 
- Wake up and seize the- - 
- Day! 
- The day? 
. - Yeah, the day when we- - 
Show Townsville just what our powers can really do. 
What? . 
We're gonna show Townsville just what our powers can really do. 
- We did something really good. 
- That's gonna really- - 
Help! 
Well, we met this guy. 
With powers like us. 
Who was also hated by everybody. 
But he had this great idea. 
To help the town. 
And make it a better place. 
- That way the town would accept us. 
- We did something to help. 
So we used all our powers. 
And abilities. 
And his ideas. 
- To help everybody. 
- City of Townsville... 
- It's gonna be so cool. 
-... I'd like to take this moment... 
- You're gonna be so proud. 
-... to thank the little people... 
Everyone's gonna love us. 
... who helped to make this day a smashing success. 
We did really goo- - 
Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup, I couldn't have done it without you. 
- It's their fault! 
- I knew they were no good! 
What happened? . 
This isn't making the town a better place. 
Yes, it is, for me. 
The hobo formerly known as" Jojo" is no more. 
From this day forward, I shall be known as : 
Mojo Jojo! 
For too long, apes and monkeys have been under the thumb of man. 
Well, the time has come to oppose that thumb and take hold of what is rightfully ours : 
The world! 
Professor, we didn't want this. 
- Liars. 
- Fibbers. 
You've doomed us all. 
Please, Professor. 
Please believe us. 
I don't know who to believe. 
I thought you were good. 
No! 
Yeah! 
All right! 
I rock! 
I rock so hard. 
For I, Mojo Jojo, have succeeded in my first, greatest and most brilliant plan ever. 
And I, Mojo Jojo, shall be king of the planet of the apes! 
You shall be king? . 
Preposterous. 
What? 
. How dare you. 
For it is I who is the one most suited to be ruler. 
Those are my clothes. 
I, Ojo Tango, shall be simian supreme. 
No Ojo. 
Mojo. 
As I unleash the offensive omnipotence of the oppressive Orango-tank. 
- Hold on. 
- Oh, no! 
- I shall get a grip on the situation. 
- You better not. 
As I, Rocko Socko, seize control and rule. 
- Wait! 
- l, Baboon Kaboom with my Baboom-bot, will be the bomb. 
And if you don't like it you can sniff my Baboom-bot bombs. 
That's classy. 
Gangway! 
For we, the Gogo Po-Trol form a chain of command that will take hold of your world. 
I, Hota Wata, am boiling mad, for you are all wet behind the ears. 
So I shall unleash a scalding torrent to drown you out, for I don't give a- - 
Watch your mouth. 
I, Cha-Ching Cha-Ching, symbolize chaotic calamity. 
We, the Doot Da Doot Da Doo Doos, shall rain on your parade because we're the spit. 
My name is Hacha Chacha And here is my schpiel 
A diabolical plan with lots of appeal 
Spreading out bananas far and wide 
And fixing up the folks For a slippery slide 
Pretty catchy. 
I, Blah-Blah-Blah-Blah, shall create a sauce of chaos and stir up trouble with a destructive force known as the tormato. 
- Tormato? 
. - Tormato. 
- l, Killa Drilla. 
- l, Bonzo Bango. 
- l, Rolo Ovo. 
- l, Cruncha Muncha. 
- l, Wacko Smacko. 
- l, Pappy Whappy. 
No! 
Do not continue with your ramblings. 
Mine are the ramblings to be obeyed. 
I am the king, supreme leader and dictator. 
Your plans are my plans because you made plans and my plan was to make you. 
I plan to rule the planet, not to have my plans plan to stop me. 
I am your creator, I am your king. 
I am Mojo Jojo. 
Obey me! 
That jerk, that big, fat, dumb jerk. 
He duped us. 
He planned it all along, and we fell for it. 
And now, everybody hates us even more. 
What are you doing? . 
What does it look like I'm doing? . 
I'm building a house because now we have to live here. 
- Live here? . 
- Yeah, don't you see? 
This can be the bedroom, and this is my bed. 
That can be your bed over there. 
I don't wanna sleep on a rock! 
Maybe if someone hadn't pushed Bubbles into the school.... 
Look, she speaks. 
Maybe if somebody hadn't insisted on walking home so we could run into the biggest liar in the universe! 
We weren't allowed to use our powers, and you know it! 
Look, it's Miss Goody-Goody. 
We weren't gonna get people to stop hating us by breaking rules. 
Yeah. 
And using our super powers to make a Help-the-town-and - make-it-a-better-place machine was following rules? 
- I didn't see you putting up a fight. 
- Well, you're gonna now. 
If it weren't for you, we wouldn't be in this stupid mess. 
You stupid! 
I'm not fighting with you, Buttercup. 
Because you know I'll kick your butt. 
No, because I know- - Never mind. 
I'm not fighting with you, and I'm not talking to you ever! 
Well, prepare yourself for a long silence, girl because we're gonna spend the rest of our lives here, thanks to you. 
At least I got me a bed. 
Blossom? . 
Buttercup? . 
Do you hear that? . 
No! 
Blossom, what should we do? . 
Miss Goody-Goody'll say we should take responsibility for our mistakes... 
-... and go help everybody. 
- lt sounds like they're hurting. 
Who cares? . 
- What do we do? . 
- Nothing. 
- Girls! 
- Professor! 
Professor! 
Professor! 
Professor! 
Help! 
Bubbles, wait! 
- Good job, but we've gotta save- - 
- The baby! 
Holy.... 
- Hey, what about- -? . 
- The dog! 
- You'll be safe now. 
- Here you go, miss. 
- Thank you. 
- Come on, Bubbles, let's- - 
Save those people. 
Wait! 
This isn't my baby. 
Good dog. 
Can we find the Professor now, please? . 
Oh, man! 
Now stay! 
Doggone it! 
Okay. You should be safe here. 
This is hopeless! 
I know. 
There's too many monkeys. 
What can we do? . 
Get your hands off him, you darn dirty ape! 
I didn't mean it! 
It was an accident! 
He wouldn't let go! 
And the dog. 
That stupid dog, and then the monkeys, and he- - 
I couldn't- 
- He couldn't- - Oh, man! 
Buttercup! 
You're a genius! 
The one way to stop the monkeys, save the town and find the Professor is to use our powers to- - - I am? . 
- She is? . 
Yeah. 
Better yet, watch! 
- Wow! 
- That was amaz- 
- Hey! 
Gross! 
Cut it out. 
Come on, girls. 
Let's put an end to this gorilla warfare. 
Good one, Bubbles. 
- Girls-- 
- Shut up! 
I was afraid of this. 
They've returned and found out what their powers can really do. 
- None of those monkeys had Professor! 
- Where could he be? 
. 
Take a good guess! 
Come on, girls! 
We've got one last monkey to get off our backs! 
Not so fast Mojo Jojo! 
Look at the little heroes here to save their daddy! 
No, girls! 
Save yourselves! 
- Sorry, Professor! 
- We can take this chump chimp down! 
Nothing he can do can stop us! 
That's better. 
It's good you little freaks know when you're beaten. 
Now if you'll excuse me, I, Mojo Jojo, have a town to take over! 
I have a world to rule! 
I have to seize control of an area and force its inhabitants to follow my way of thinking! 
Even if it means taking extreme measures! 
- You wouldn't! 
- I would! 
Professor! 
Now I am more Mojo than before! 
Now, as I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted I, Mojo Jojo, have succeeded in my first, greatest and most brilliant plan ever! 
And I, Mojo Jojo shall be king! 
Girls, thank goodness you're okay. Now let's get out of this town! 
- It's no use. 
- We already tried running away. 
We have to fix the problem we helped start. 
You said to give everyone time to understand our specialness. 
Well, now it's time for everyone to understand. 
Especially Mojo! 
Surrender now, and we'll go easy on you! 
Down here! 
Oh, my! 
You're actually trying to stop me? . 
That's so cute! 
- Try, nothing! 
- We will stop you! 
Who are you calling" cute"? . 
Okay, let's play! 
Buttercup! 
- Good job, girls! 
- That more Mojo is no more! 
Girls! 
Somebody's mad. 
Look out! 
Oh, no, look! 
Mojo's got Blossom pinned down! 
I have an idea. 
Come on! 
- Do you think he's finished? 
. - No, but you are! 
Fools! 
You dare to challenge me? . 
Attempt to defeat me? . 
Try to destroy me? .! 
I, who saved you from certain death? . 
After all I've done for you, you betray me? . 
And why? . 
For them? . 
The ones who hated you.... 
Have forsaken you? . 
Can't you see? 
. None of them will ever understand you as I can. 
For we are kindred spirits, whose powers spring from the same source. 
So, girls, do not make me destroy you. 
For we are smarter, we are stronger! 
We are invincible! 
We have the power! 
We are superior to them! 
And we shall rule! 
All we have to do is work together. 
Girls, join me. 
No! 
We'd never join you, and it's because we are stronger. 
- Because we are invincible. 
- Because we have the power! 
We have to protect them from you! 
- It's you who has to be feared. 
- Because you are a monster! 
You are evil! 
And you are it! 
Curses! 
Girls, you were right! 
We should stop Mojo, and I know how! 
I whipped up an antidote to Chemical X! It'll do away with his powers! 
I'm so sorry for doubting you. 
You are good little girls, and I love you! 
We love you too! 
- And we're really sorry. 
- We messed up really bad. 
- But we're ready, Professor. 
- Ready? . 
To take the Antidote X to get rid of our powers. 
If it wasn't for them, none of this would have happened. 
And maybe everyone would like us more if we were just normal little girls. 
No! 
Don't do that because that was pretty cool, with the.... 
Girls, I think what the Mayor is trying to say is we're sorry, and thank you. 
Yes, that was super, just super! 
- Amazing! 
- Fantastic! 
- Wonderful! 
- Stupendous! 
Thank you. 
That was awesome! 
You were all flying and running! 
And then, laser eyes! 
Then, bam! 
And then- 
- And then, bam, you punched that guy! 
Remember? . 
Yeah, that was great. 
You know, this town stinks. 
And I was wondering if, maybe sometime we could, like, call you to save the day or whatever. 
Can we, Professor? . 
Well, I don't know.... 
Okay, but only if it's before your bedtime. 
Help! 
Sugar, spice and everything nice. 
These were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect little girl. 
But Professor Utonium accidentally added an extra ingredient to the mix : 
Chemical X. 
Thus Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup were born! 
Using their ultra super powers, they've dedicated their lives to fighting crime and the forces of evil. 
And so for the very first time, the day is saved, thanks to : 
The Powerpuff Girls! 
Hey, that's a good name for them. 
Powerpuff Girls, yeah! 
I like that. 
Wonder if they will. 
I'll run it by them. 
Powerpuff Girls! 
Go, Go, Go! Move it. 
Let's go. - Let's go. 
- There's four of you. 
- You can count. I'm impressed. 
Now drive. 
- Rule one : never change the deal. 
Deal was transportation for three men with a combined weight of 254 kilos. 
Yeah? Well, this is a new deal. 
An extra 80 kilos means we'll not make your destination on the gas I allotted. 
- We'll stop for more gas. 
- Every stop we make exposes us. 
Every exposure increases the risk of getting caught. 
An extra 80 kilos means the shock absorbers I installed for this job will not give us the ability to outmanoeuvre any police that might be chasing us, which means, if there is a chase, we lose our advantage, 
which also increases the possibility of getting caught. 
I don't want to get caught. 
You don't want to get caught. 
Just drive the car or you're gonna catch a bullet to the brains. 
- Then who's going to drive? 
- Shoot this asshole. I'll drive. 
Not without the ignition code you won't. 
Three men, 254 kilos. 
That was the deal. 
- Three men. 254 kilos. 
- Seat belts. 
See what I mean about the shocks? 
Now it's time. 
Wrong way. 
If you don't mind, I just conditioned the leather back there. 
- Take us to the drop point. 
- Not yet. 
The cops! 
What are you doing? 
Don't stop now. Do something. 
- Come on. Do something. - What are you thinking? 
Your gun, please. 
Police. Stop! 
- You gave me too much. 
- I need you to take us to Avignon. 
The deal was this far, no further. 
The deal is the deal. Rule number one. 
- Rules are meant to be broken. - Not mine. 
Yesterday in Nice, four men robbed the Alliance Investment Corporation. 
One man died on the sidewalk. 
The others were apprehended early this morning when they took a wrong turn on a one-way street in Avignon and ran into a taxi cab. 
The police said, were it not for the poor driving, the 20 million euros in bearer bonds would have been cashed and gone by this afternoon. 
I always say, the way a man treats his car is how he treats himself. 
I'd say that's probably true, Inspector. 
You have a good sense of humour for a foreigner, Monsieur Frank. 
Like the French. 
Sly wit. Just the right amount of flavour. 
Been out driving? 
Till they pass a law says I can't. 
Want to come in for a coffee? 
Thank you, but I have a lot of stops to make. 
- 88 to be exact. 
- That's a lot of stops. 
A lot of 1999 black BMW 735s with 0-6 in the licence plates to check out. 
It's a very popular car with a certain type down here. 
You've seen them. 
They come over from Italy in those very expensive suits, and the young, pretty girls with big jewellery and too much makeup. 
Very... 
Mafia. 
There was a robbery. 
A getaway. 
Some very fancy driving. 
Was someone in a 1999 black BMW 735? 
With 0-6 in the plates. 
- Have you been to the city lately? 
- Not for a while. 
I love Nice. 
The food, the way they grill fish. 
No place else in France does it the way they do in Nice. 
And the women... 
I prefer the women there. 
They are more complicated than the local variety. 
Don't you think? 
I don't particularly like complicated. 
- You like to keep it simple. 
- Why are you so interested? 
Oh, you know, ever since I was a little boy, military people have always intrigued me. 
- I'm ex-military. 
- I am an ex-little boy. 
Sure you don't have time for a coffee? 
Everything's always so neat with you, Monsieur Frank. 
Nothing ever out of place. 
I'll take that as a compliment, coming from a man who pays attention to every detail. 
Maybe I'll come back later for that coffee. 
Door's always open to you. 
- Hugo gave me your number. 
- Be brief. 
- I'm looking for a transporter. 
- I'm listening. 
- One bag, that's it. 
- Dimensions? 
- Be specific. 
- 1.5m by a half metre. 
- Weight. 
- 50 kilos, not more. 
- Destination? 
- 24, rue de Luxembourg. - You're delivering to Mr... 
- Rule two : no names. 
- Time of pickup? 
- Seven in the morning, at the front door. 
A package. 150 by 50, 50 kilos, 250 kilometres. 
Travelling within the speed limit, one stop for refreshments : 40,000. 
Half now, half on delivery. Delivery will be at noon. 
If no one's there, it is not my responsibility, I'll leave the package. 
Once we make a deal, the terms cannot be changed or renegotiated. 
- Another rule? 
- That's rule number one. 
Do we have a deal? 
- You're very precise. 
- Transportation is a precise business. 
Flat. 
Don't move. I'm not gonna hurt you. 
I'll just make a little hole so you can drink. 
Please, come on. 
Come on. Drink. 
That's enough. 
Good girl. 
I'll take the tape off. 
If you scream, I'll have to kill you. 
I have to pee. 
You want me to do it in your car? 
I'm gonna take my knife out, so don't scream. 
It's to cut you free. 
You don't need your mouth to pee. 
You have one minute. 
Fifty-five, fifty-four, fifty-three, fifty-two... 
Breaking the rules, Frank. 
Not good to break the rules. 
Fifteen. 
Seven. 
Two. 
Time's up. 
Don't make me drag you out. 
Shit! 
Rule three : never look in the package. 
Hope you enjoyed your pee cos it's your last on this trip. 
See what comes of breaking the rules? 
- You're late. 
- Ran into a little problem. 
Nothin' serious? 
Nothin' serious. 
- Did you open the package? 
- Rule three : never open the package. 
I like that. Rules. 
You can't get anything done in a world without rules. 
You're a foreigner, right? 
Nice little thing you've got going for yourself. 
High class. 
Good reputation. 
- I didn't get your name. 
- Rule two : no names. 
Of course. 
You don't count it. 
Why? Should I? 
That concludes the deal. 
You know, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind transporting something for me. 
That's what you do, right? 
You deliver, no questions asked. 
Why not? 
Weight? 
- Maybe a kilo. 
- Destination? 
Grenoble. 306, rue de Lac. 
A Mr... 
Right, I forgot. 
Rule two. 
I like him. 
Where is he? 
You're like dogshit. 
You're everywhere. 
I know you wanna pee. 
All you wanna do is pee. 
I ask the questions, you answer them. 
No long speeches, just keep it simple. 
- Who are you? 
- My name is Lai. 
I come from... 
I ask the questions, you answer them. 
Nothing more, nothing less. 
You wanna try again? 
- What kind of shit am I in? - Deep shit. 
Very deep shit. 
Those guys... 
Sorry. I won't say any... 
- Where are you going? 
- To bed. 
Can't think straight when I'm tired. 
Good night's sleep, I always see things better. 
- Can I leave? - Be my guest. 
Are you comfortable? 
- Save your strength. 
Just tell me : who did this? 
- The transporter. 
- The transporter's dead. He's not. 
You believe me? 
I believe you. 
And the police, they were here? 
- You told' em nothing, right? 
- Right. 
You couldn't talk. 
Let's keep it that way. 
I picked them from the garden outside. 
I didn't know if you like coffee or tea, so I made both. 
I hope you like madeleines. 
Try one. 
Careful. 
It's hot. 
Good? 
Let me. 
- I like it quiet in the morning. 
- Yes. 
Quiet in the morning. Me too. 
I'm the same way. 
I like very quiet. 
Sorry. 
Are you looking for milk? 
- There's milk at the door. 
- Stay. I'll go. 
- And you are? 
- The new cook. 
Is Monsieur Frank in? 
- Is your invitation for coffee still open? 
- Sure. 
- Madeleine? 
- Home-made? 
I'll bring some more. 
My mother used to make fresh madeleines every morning. 
I smell them and my whole childhood comes back in one big flood. 
Like Proust. 
You ever read Proust, Monsieur Frank? 
It's fantastic. 
Memory like a steel trap. 
He would've been a great cop. Real determined. Milk? 
I used to have a memory like Proust, like a filing cabinet. 
I'd see something and remember it like that. 
Like licence plates. I'd see a plate and it was printed in my head. 
Now I need all the help I can get remembering whose plate goes with whose car. 
Like this one. 
- That's mine. 
- Memories. 
- So? Where's the rest of the car? 
- I was hoping you could tell me. It was stolen. 
I went to Fréjus to pick up a few things. 
- When I came out of the market, it was... 
- Gone. Did you report it? 
It was first on my list of things to do today. 
It's a long walk from Fréjus. How did you get home? 
I brought him. 
I saw him walking along the dark road. 
A risky thing, picking up a stranger on a dark road. 
He had a kind face. 
- I didn't see a car outside. 
- It's in the garage. 
May I see it? 
Pretty nice car for a cook. 
Some people have a problem with the Germans. 
They are too aggressive, they take up the best beaches in summer, they can't cook worth a damn. 
I say, anyone makes such great cars can't be all bad. 
I would say you should work out very well for Monsieur Frank, Mademoiselle. 
Work out for both of us. 
My intuition says this is probably a good time for me to go file my report. 
- Where's the rest of my car? 
- Oh, yes. I almost forgot. 
It was blown to pieces at a rest stop. 
What's left of it is down at the lab. 
They are trying to separate what was left of the two cops in the trunk from the rest of it. 
But you wouldn't know anything about that? - No. 
- Sorry to interrupt. 
- Thank you for the coffee and the memories. 
- Come back any time. 
Would you mind walking me? 
You have always been very quiet about your business. 
I appreciate that. 
But this business at the rest stop, it's not very quiet. 
I don't suppose you would like to tell me something besides the stolen-car story? 
If I had one, I would. 
May I suggest that when the two of you show up in my office after lunch, that you have one - a better one than you currently have. 
You are the one he wants to see, not me. 
- Quiet. 
I have to think. 
- You were supposed to think last night. 
Yeah, well, last night I had nightmares. 
About a girl who came into my nice, quiet life and screwed it all up. 
Everything she touched broke and every move she made became a catastrophe. 
OK, sorry. 
I'm still wondering if I want to know everything or nothing about you. 
- What? 
- It's the quiet. 
I thought you liked quiet. 
Not this quiet. 
- You OK? - No. 
Good. 
Let's go. 
Go, go, go! 
Don't stay there. 
Give me your hand. 
Get in. 
Do you wanna die? 
Calm down. 
Don't worry. 
- Stay here. I'll be right back. 
- No. Wait. 
Put it on. 
You OK? Sure? 
Is this your house? 
Yeah, I guess. 
I should mind my own goddamn business. 
Simple rule, simple little rule. 
There's gotta be some dry clothes in this house. 
" Don't open the package." 
Nothin' but trouble, you open the goddamn package. 
- What are you doing? 
- Making up for the trouble. 
- Wait. Why are you making... 
- No more questions. 
Wait. I don't like it when things get complicated. 
You like things simple. 
- Anyone else swimming at that time? - No. Did you see anybody else swimming? 
No one. 
So, you took a walk, had a swim on a beach where no one else was swimming, past the point where you can't see or be seen from the beach on either side, which makes witnesses a little hard to come by. 
That's the point of a romantic swim. 
Who wants witnesses? 
- And then? 
- We came back to the house, found it on fire. 
Just like that? 
The 5,000 rounds of spent ammo my men found all around the house...? 
Maybe they had the wrong house. 
People with this kind of firepower do not make mistakes about who they visit. 
- Who would want you this dead? 
- I don't know. 
- Any problems with a client? 
- I don't have clients. I'm retired. 
I live on my army pension, you know that. 
You've known who I am and who I was for years. 
Any enemies you can think of? People from the past? 
I left the past behind when I moved here. 
A past like yours you never leave behind. 
I'll just be a moment. 
Don't leave. 
- What are you doing? 
- Computers know everything. - You just need a password. 
- Are you nuts? 
We're in a police station. 
You're always complaining, except when we make love. 
Then you say nothing. 
Hello. 
See? 
- So, where will you be staying? 
- I don't know. 
My cousin has a small hotel. 
- Thanks, but we'll manage. 
- Without money? It will be hard. 
It's not much, but at least you won't go hungry. Thank you. 
- Where are you going? 
- To see that guy. Good luck. 
You're not coming? 
- But he blew up your car. 
- I'll buy a new one. 
- He burned your house. 
- I'll rebuild it. 
- He tried to kill you. 
- And as far as he knows, he succeeded. 
Some advice : 
I don't know what you're into, but whoever wanted you dead thinks you are. 
You have a free pass to start over. 
Here's the advice : start over! 
There are 400 people dying in a container on a ship. 
My father. 
My sisters. 
The ship arrives today. 
They will make my father a slave. 
The only one who knows the container number is that guy. 
- You're very good. 
- What do you mean? 
From the moment you saw those pictures in my house, you set me up to get involved. 
Breakfast, giving the excuse to the cop to help me, one lie after another. 
- Not everything is a lie. 
- Name one thing that isn't. 
What happened in the house between us, that was not a lie. 
You were a soldier. 
Your job was to save people. 
- Past tense. 
- What does that mean? 
I got tired of seeing my best efforts get turned into bullshit by the same people who pay me. 
- No one cared. 
- This time, I care. 
Thank you. 
No phone calls for half an hour? 
Hello. Surprise. 
Sit. 
Put your hands where I can see' em. 
Before we get to the heart of the matter, I have a question : why'd you try to kill me? 
You lied to me. You opened the package. 
You broke the rules, your rules. 
Did you expect me to recommend you for another job? 
What's the ship number? 
Mr Transporter, we can both agree. 
I answered your first question politely. I won't answer any more. 
So I suggest you kill me right now... and go screw yourself. 
I can't find anything. 
Poor Frank. What'd she tell you? 
We're smuggling people in containers? 
- Lai's the perfect name for her. 
- Mr Kwai's on the way up. 
Your father's here. He'll get a kick out of this. 
- I thought your father was in a container. - Yes. 
I mean, no. 
There are 400 people in that container. 
- Stay where you are. 
- She's a real heartbreaker, isn't she? 
Ten seconds, two choices. 
The information, or your brains on the desk. 
Now tell me I'm lying. 
Nine, eight... 
- Give me the gun. 
- I don't know what you're talking about. 
... five, four, three, two... 
One. 
Shoot. 
Would I kill my own daughter, Lai? 
Come on now. 
Put it down. 
We'll talk. 
She thinks we're smuggling people in containers. 
- Where do you get these ideas? 
- Stay away. 
- Could you kill your own father? 
- Please, I am begging you. 
- Stop what you are doing. 
- I do what I do. I am who I am. 
I'll never change. 
So if you're going to kill me, kill me. 
But if you don't, get this gun out of my face. 
Give me. 
I know he's innocent. 
You have such a good heart. 
Always interested in saving innocent people. 
Well, here's your big chance. 
Drop your gun and you will save one. 
Kill him. 
- The police are on the way up. - What now? 
Take her. 
Send in Leo. I need him to wrap something up. 
Just for the record, there were 400 people in that container. 
Only 395 made it here alive. 
- Inspector. Am I glad you're here. 
- What is this? 
This man used my partner's daughter to try and blackmail us. 
Luckily my security got the drop on him. 
I want to press charges : kidnapping, extortion, assault. 
I know this man. 
I suppose in your business you have to know all types. 
- Now should I call my lawyer? 
- We'll handle it. 
I'll expect all of you at my office for your statements. 
As soon as I contact my lawyer, we'll be more than happy to oblige. 
The doctor said you'll have a headache for a few days, then you'll go back to normal. 
Where are they? 
I think you should be more concerned with where you are. 
What got into you? 
You were always so careful. 
- I've got to get out of here. 
- The charges are filed. You will not be getting out for a very long time. 
Assaulting a distinguished member of the international business community, kidnapping his daughter, extortion... 
I'm sorry, Frank. 
I would like to help you. 
But if you continue with the same old story : I'm retired, living on a pension... 
I need fresh, Frank. 
I need new. 
For once, I need the truth. 
They're smuggling people, from Asia, through Marseilles, in containers. 
- You know this for a fact? 
- The girl told me. 
You believe her? 
In French, we have a saying : 
never believe the cook. 
- She's not the cook. 
- I suspected. 
- You know, Frank. No one is perfect. 
- You're saying you'll do nothing. 
I'm saying I'm going to start an investigation. 
And in the meantime, the 400 people could be dead already. 
What am I supposed to do? 
There are laws. 
- Sometimes you have to make your own law. 
- Like you do? 
At least, with me it doesn't get 12 months to get the job done. 
I know. 
That's what I admire about you. 
All that army training, all that sneaking around... 
A man like you could probably resolve this case in how long? 
- 12 hours? 
- Less. 
Less? 
Impressive. 
You'd be the perfect man for the job. - Yes. 
If I were out. 
- Yes. If you were out. 
Anybody moves and I kill him. 
If this is how you transport, I'm amazed you get any work at all. 
Come give me a hand. 
Maybe I should go with you? 
Thanks, but I'm better alone. 
That is a very small boat to fight a very big war. 
- But it's a good boat. 
- Frank, here. 
You'll need it. 
Or maybe not. 
Shipment is cleared. 
Here's the paperwork. 
Take the highway all the way to the first exit, Lyon. 
Go straight to the warehouse. 
We'll be right behind you, just in case. 
We are ready to go. 
Lai, dear... 
I spent thousands of dollars for you to go to school and learn English. 
- The least you can do is speak it. 
- I hate you. 
I'm still your father. 
Get her out of here. 
Give me a minute. 
Keep him alive. 
Let's go. 
Don't. 
Bitch. 
Good morning. You lost? 
- I'm lookin' to do a little sightseeing. 
- This plane is not for tourists. 
I'm not a tourist. 
Call this guy and tell him to meet me. 
Where? 
Down there. 
Move up. 
Now. 
Get closer. 
Steady. 
Down. 
Hands on your head. 
Move. 
Watch her. 
If she moves or I don't return, shoot her. 
- To the water. 
- I'm really not in the mood for a swim. 
March! 
So how did a lowlife like you end up with my daughter? 
- Found her in a bag, where you left her. 
- You know nothing. 
Move. 
You got involved with the wrong girl, you dumb shit. 
The delivery will be made, my daughter will get over it. 
If I'm lucky, maybe she'll see the light. 
Yeah, if she's lucky, maybe you'll get hit by a truck. 
- What do you know? 
- She'll never stop being who she is. 
She'll never be you or anything like you. 
She'll come around. But you won't be here to see it. 
I guess she won't be coming around after all. 
- Turn around. 
- I'd rather see it coming. 
Makes no difference to me. 
He was a bastard, but he was still my father. 
Pretty impressive timing, Frank. 
I guess I underestimated you. 
He came back again last night and tore me like paper. 
He opened me like a flower of pain and it felt good. 
He sank into me and set me on fire like he always does. 
Made me burn from the inside out. 
How did you know it was the devil? 
I know what you're thinking. 
I know you think I'm talking about my stepfather because you don't believe in the devil. 
Okay, let's talk about your stepfather. 
You know about my stepfather. 
You know I cut his throat. 
I cut his Adam's apple in half like a piece of fruit on a summer day so he wouldn't say a word. 
I sat next to him and watched him die slowly. 
It was the only way to help him stop. 
Stop what? 
Stop fucking me! 
You're not listening. 
I am listening, Chloe. 
You're not listening with your heart. 
Just your brain. 
Your brain is the problem. 
You have no idea how it feels not to be trusted. 
You've got to trust me too, Chloe. 
You can't trust someone who thinks you're crazy. 
Okay. I think that's enough for today. 
But I do think we made some really good headway found out some new things- - 
Do you know what it is to burn from the inside? 
- Do you know? Because you are dead! 
- Let her go, Chloe. 
I am. I'm not touching her! 
I'm not touching her! Let me go! 
Let me go! Let me go. 
Thank you. 
You're driving me crazy! Stop! 
- Stop it! 
- Let go! 
Stop it! 
I can walk by myself! 
Stand up! 
Look at that. 
" I'm a doctor." 
" Open this door." Hey, you are dead! 
Get in. 
She's nuts. 
Hey. 
Sorry. 
I need to cross-reference some files with you on Monday. 
How's your morning? 
- Check with Anna. She'll fit you in. 
- Thanks. Sorry. 
I'm not discharging her, period. 
If you want to pursue this, sir, have a judge order her transfer. 
Until then she's mine. 
Thank you. 
Lawyers. 
Hey, come on in. 
What's up? 
Chloe. She's embellishing her rape story again. 
She says that the devil is visiting her in her cell. 
- Okay. 
- It's the third time in three months. 
It has something to do with her stepfather, possibly remorse but instead of assessing the memory and accepting it she just falls into these satanic meanderings. 
Time. Give it time. 
I've given it time. 
Time and Elavil. And Mellaril and Haldol. 
Maybe they're just too medicated. 
I know we all create our realities to some extent. Yes, true. 
But what she creates is so far from any objective reality.... 
Chloe's mind only runs on one track. 
Well, right now, my mind is running on empty. 
Come here. 
You have a brilliant mind. 
You'll figure it out. 
Throw it on the mirror. 
This is what she sees now. 
- A distorted image of herself. 
- Who are you in all this? 
- I'm the mirror. 
- You are the mirror. 
If I'm the mirror and she's the image then who are you? 
I can see both of you so I'm God. 
Or just an overworked hospital bureaucrat. 
" God" is good. 
Always remember, the ability to repress is actually a vital survival tool. 
Without it Chloe might not have survived. 
Sorry, am I interrupting the happy couple? 
Dr. Graham. 
We were just discussing repression as a survival mechanism. 
Oh, yeah, I had a date last week. 
I barely survived it. I'm trying to forget it. 
I'm sure your amorous adventures are fascinating, doctor but sadly, I'm on my way out. 
- Well, don't let me- - I'll just- - 
- No, no, no, I'm leaving. 
I'm gonna run out to Willow Creek. Meet the new contractor. 
I'll be here. See you at dinner. 
Keep an eye on my wife for me, Pete. I know you will. Here. 
- No, thanks. 
- No, let me circumcise it for you. 
Smoke it tonight while it's fresh. 
- Good night, boss. 
- Good night, kids. 
Why don't we share one of those golden-crust, cheese-filled specials. 
- It sounds like a great offer... 
- Here's the file. 
-... but I got work to do. 
- I'm buying. 
- It's cold when it gets here. 
- We could warm it up. 
- I hate pizza. 
- Who doesn't like pizza? 
Come on, you gotta eat. 
Not with you. 
Come on, we're supposed to celebrate. 
I just got circumcised.... 
- Who's inside? 
- We have Shelley for observation. 
- Why? What happened? 
- She had another attack. 
- What'd you do, up her meds? 
- Yeah, 25 milligrams. 
That's extreme. That dose is way too high. 
I want a copy of that on my desk by Monday, okay? 
- Okay. 
- Thank you. 
Damn generator. 
Not again. 
Irene, is that you? 
This electric system's gonna give us trouble. 
Fourth time this week. 
I'm going for my swim. 
Well, I'm gonna do my job, as long as these damn lights stay on. 
- Good night, Joe. 
- Hey, how many laps, doc? 
Fifty-five, but who's counting? 
Oh, you've outdone yourself. 
Hey, safe drive home. 
- Thank you. Say hi to your wife for me. 
- Will do. 
All that education but you can't remember an umbrella. 
- Did you get my note? 
- I got your note. Your business note. 
Right. So how was your date with...? 
With what's-her-name? It was like all of my dates. It was brief. 
She didn't respond to my sense of humour, my boyish good looks so I started talking about work. 
She said that was not a suitable topic for a first date and that was it. 
I mean, it was just drinks, you know. 
I mean, we didn't even have dinner. 
She's not right. When you know, you know. 
I know. 
- I'll follow you down the hill. 
- You don't have to. 
- I'm supposed to keep an eye on you. 
- Since when did you listen to the boss? 
Severe showers all over northern Connecticut and New Hampshire. 
- I know, I see that. - -rain in Lennox County.... 
- -flooding throughout Lennox County and closure.... 
- I can't let you through. 
Road's closed. - What's going on? 
- I got this. - There's a sinkhole. 
- Hi, Bob. 
- You picked a hell of a night for a drive. 
There's a sinkhole up here, you can't get through. Sorry. 
- What should I do? 
- Go a quarter of a mile, take a left- - 
You know that bridge that Doug and I fish at? 
- Yeah, the little white one? 
- That's the one. 
- Yeah. 
- You can go across there. 
- Okay, thanks. 
- Hey, tell Doug to give me a call. 
Will do. 
- Doug, you're home? 
- Yeah, where are you? 
I got detoured, so I'll be home in a few minutes, okay? 
How was Willow Creek? 
This rain is slowing the work down. It's a big mess. 
- Are you okay? 
- Yeah. 
Doug. 
Doug! 
Are you okay? 
Hey! 
Oh, my God. Okay. Okay. 
I'm a doctor. 
I'm gonna take you to the hospital. I'm a doctor, honey. 
I'm gonna help you, okay? You're gonna be okay. 
I'm gonna help you, okay? 
Help me! 
Somebody! 
Dr. Graham! 
You better tell me why I'm in here, Irene. 
She got up wild. 
- Bring your ass back in here. 
- Give me 40 milligrams of Ativan. 
- Get your hands off me. 
- Stay in the cell. 
- Keep her off. 
- Restrain her. 
Keep her off of me. Get off of me. 
Do you hear me? Get off of me. 
Hold on. Calm- - 
What are you doing? What are you doing to me? 
Thank you, nurse. 
- Are you okay? 
- Yeah, she calmed down. 
This is so sad. 
Miranda, this is very awkward. 
I suppose that technically I shouldn't even be treating you but I managed to get the court to grant us a waiver until you're transferred. 
Anything we discuss is in strict confidence and won't go anywhere but this room. 
How long have I been in here? 
Three days. 
Why? Why? 
You were admitted to our neurosurgical unit, you were seizing violently. 
We did scans and they revealed left-sided weakness, numbness severe frontal-lobe deficits. 
You received Haloperidol, Ativan injections. 
When you came out of it, we tested. You were negative for PCP. 
You were put in restraints for a day and a half so you wouldn't injure yourself. 
And then you basically went into a state of catatonia. 
This is the first time I've seen you lucid. 
I wanna talk to my husband. 
Where is he? Where is he? 
You know, you're the most logical person I know, bar none. 
You rely only on the facts. 
So why am I telling you this? 
You're establishing my personality. 
You think I'm a rational person. 
You don't think I'm impulsive or emotional. 
And following this pattern of analysis, we are about to discuss a traumatic event which has rendered this psychological profile useless. 
- You think I'm in denial. 
- Don't analyse yourself just focus on remembering. 
Miranda what's the last thing you remember? 
I remember Chloe. 
I was having my Friday night session with Chloe. 
How did that go? 
She was embellishing her rape story. 
- I saw Doug. - Dr. Graham. 
You were there. 
When I went back to my office, I worked on Chloe's file. 
I decided to call it quits, I went down to the pool, had a swim, 55 laps saw Joe, got my keys. 
Went to my car. You walked me to it. 
- Yes. 
- But-- 
- There was a detour. 
- Oh, hey, tell Doug.... 
I had to go over the bridge, so I went over the bridge. 
I wonder what else happened. Try to remember. 
I got home. 
I saw Doug. 
He was on the couch. 
Try to remember. 
There was a girl. 
- Yeah, there was a girl. 
- No, there was no- - 
Yeah, there was a girl. 
- A girl at the bridge. 
- There was no report- - 
- There was some kind of accident. 
- No. 
- The girl was bloody. On the bridge.... 
- I want to ask you about Doug. 
What's the last thing you remember? 
Why are you asking about Doug? 
I'm telling you about a girl I saw. 
Was there any trouble in your marriage? 
No, there was no trouble in my marriage. 
And why are you using the past tense of the word? 
Miranda you don't remember anything about Doug? 
Don't tell me something's wrong with Doug. 
I have to tell you something. 
Something very difficult. 
No, no, no.... 
- Don't tell me something's with Doug. 
- Miranda Doug is dead. 
You killed him. 
- No! 
No! No! 
- Orderly! 
I didn't. 
- No, I didn't. 
- Orderly! 
I didn't! I didn't do it! No! 
No! No! No, don't do it! 
- It's okay. - I didn't do it. 
I didn't do it. 
I'm on your side. 
One little bit more. 
Rita. 
Let go. 
It's Dr. Grey. 
Look it up. Don't look at me like that. 
I'm the official champion again. 
Hello, Miranda. Welcome. 
You're one of us now. 
You know I don't belong here, Chloe. 
If you're here, it must mean that you belong. 
You are not a doctor in here. 
And even if you tell the truth no one will listen. 
You know why? 
Because you're crazy. 
And the more you try to prove them wrong the crazier you appear. 
You are invisible now. 
Can you feel it? 
Don't touch me. 
Are you scared? 
No. 
You should be. 
I'm dreaming. 
Dream logic, primary process, that's what this is. 
I'm dreaming. 
I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming. 
I'm dreaming. 
I'm dreaming. 
I'm not crazy. I'm dreaming. 
Rise and shine, honey. 
It's a new day. 
I wanna talk to Pete. 
You'll see Dr. Graham all in good time, but I want you to have some breakfast. 
- Why are you doing this to me, Irene? 
- I'm just doing my job. 
You don't want me to get Jim to help me, now do you? 
Good girl. You're doing good. 
Come on, sweetheart, now it's time for a shower. 
Come on, honey, time to wash away your sins. 
You're a nut. 
Yeah, it's you. You. 
Get away. Get away. 
What's your problem? 
I looked away for a second. It's unacceptable. 
It's not your fault. 
Patients always find a way to hurt themselves, if that's what they want. 
I never pegged her for a cutter, that's all. 
Neither did I. 
Shelley says Chloe's been threatening Miranda so I put her in isolation for the day. 
How is she? 
She's a mess. 
I can't believe she's lost it so quickly. 
I've never seen that before. 
She cut herself 35 times, a lot of blood, but it's superficial. 
- What was the implement? 
- Probably a scalpel though how anybody got it in there, I have no idea. 
Hey, Tony. 
We're fine. 
Come on. 
You think I did this to myself, don't you? 
Did you? 
No. 
Well, I don't know. 
Who would it be, then? 
Would it be Chloe, or...? 
I don't know. 
By your own admission you have difficulty distinguishing what's reality from fantasy, so is it possible? 
Yeah, as a doctor, I understand why you think that. 
But something is really happening to me. 
What about this moment, right now? 
What about it? 
Is this a hallucination? 
Is it? 
I suggest that we simply increase the medication until things make sense. 
Or maybe until I can get myself a new doctor. 
Pardon? 
Since I'm hallucinating and I can't seem to remember things you can help me with something. 
Yeah. 
Inhale. 
Did we have an affair? 
No. 
Did you want to? 
Yes. 
Did you think I wanted to? 
Yes. 
Then why didn't we? 
Because you were married to the boss. 
But I'm not now. 
I'm here- - I'm.... 
I'm trying to help you. 
Why don't you trust me? 
Because you can't trust somebody when they think you're crazy. 
Phil. 
Hello, Miranda. 
I need to talk to you for a minute. 
This is about Pete. 
What about him, Miranda? 
I don't think he's the best doctor to be treating me. 
Is your complaint about him on a personal level? 
Pete's the best doctor I have on my staff now. 
And he has my full support. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, Miranda. 
- Miranda. 
- Hi, Teddy. 
- How are they treating you? 
- Like I'm crazy, Teddy. 
- They think I did it, but I didn't do it. 
- All right. Thank you. 
- I didn't do it, Teddy. 
- Have a seat. 
Let's not.... 
Let's not talk about what you did or didn't do, all right? 
What's important is what I can do for you now. 
Now, the DA is pushing for a hearing as early as next week. 
Next week? 
We haven't even had time to investigate. 
We can't have a hearing next week. 
As your attorney, I gotta tell you the evidence is overwhelming. 
You've been placed at the scene. 
The sheriff saw you driving home. 
The neighbours heard the screams. 
They've got the murder weapon with your prints on it. 
Your prints are on the floor, walls, everything. 
Yeah, but what's my motive? I don't have a motive, Teddy. 
Why would I do that? 
Maybe one of his ex-patients came. 
Has anybody checked the files? Has anybody escaped? 
That person would have a motive. 
I was there, and I would scream. 
- Maybe I went into shock. 
- Miranda. 
The only shot we have is to plead temporary insanity. 
I don't even know if that's gonna work. You're a brilliant psychiatrist. 
That will make jurors think" If she wanted to kill somebody she could probably fake insanity and get away with it." 
I'm not crazy. 
- That's the point. 
- No, the point is I'm the only one around here that believes I didn't kill my husband! 
Do you think I'm crazy? 
That's all right. 
Forget it. 
Forget it. 
Sheriff Ryan is here. 
He'd like to talk to you. 
You know he was Doug's best friend, so I'd advise against it. 
It's fine, Teddy. 
I don't have anything to hide. 
Five minutes. 
Hi, Bob. 
Miranda. 
I just have a few questions that we need to clear up. 
When you first came in and he was sitting on the couch the way we reconstruct the crime is the first blow came from in front of him. 
Which means he must have seen it coming. 
And what we don't understand is how he.... 
- Why did you do it? 
- Sheriff. 
How could you kill Doug like that? 
He loved you. 
- That's the question I need answered. 
- You don't have to answer. 
I don't have any answers to the questions, Bob. 
You don't? 
You better start thinking of some answers, because you're in some trouble. 
- Sheriff, that's enough. That's enough! 
- No, no, no. 
I need her to tell me why she did it. 
Okay, we're done. Enough! 
Let's kill your friend, see how you feel! 
- You said no shock treatment. 
- Here's some shock treatment! 
- Stop it. 
Why would you take these out? 
- Don't look. 
Don't look at them. 
I had to pick him up off the floor, Miranda. 
In pieces! 
Miranda, what's that? 
It's okay. It's okay, Miranda. 
- Why are you doing this to me? - Miranda, let's just go. 
We're done. 
- Why are you doing this to me? 
- It's okay. 
Why are you doing this to me? Why are you doing this to me? 
! 
Come in, Miranda. 
Please, take a seat. 
So.... 
You wanted to see me. 
I was there. 
I was there when Doug was killed. 
But I wasn't alone. 
I wasn't there alone, and that's what" not alone" means. 
- Who was there with you? 
- I don't know who it was. 
I don't know. I don't know who it was. 
But somebody else was there. 
Miranda. 
We know you have no family left. 
We are your family now. 
I know. I know you.... I know. 
I want you to know that we're gonna do everything we possibly can to help you and to make you feel secure. 
And to make you feel that you can trust us here. 
But there's a hearing scheduled. 
- Miranda. Sit down. 
- Just-- Come on, sit down. 
Miranda. 
Who is this girl? 
- Put the picture back. 
- Who is this girl? 
That's my daughter, Rachel. 
No, this is the girl I saw at the bridge. This is the girl. 
- No. 
- How is she? 
Where is she? 
- It's impossible. 
- This is the girl I've been seeing. 
This girl, right here. 
She's dead. 
Rachel died four years ago. 
I'm a rational person. 
I believe in science. 
I don't believe in the paranormal. 
And I don't believe in ghosts. 
But if you are the ghost of Rachel Parsons then you would let me out of this cell. 
Bob, you leave this? 
Shit. 
Pete's office. 
Chloe. 
Chloe! 
Help me! 
Let me go! Let me go! 
Check Chloe! 
Check Chloe! She needs help! 
- Did you talk to Chloe? 
- Yes. 
- Was she raped? - Was she raped? 
No. 
- Why? 
- Did you check her? 
Did I- -? She was checked. Of course she was checked. 
- He didn't have time. 
- He? 
- What about her face? 
She had a cut. - Ran into a wall. She did that to herself. 
I saw a tattoo. 
Did she talk about a tattoo? 
- Why don't you sit down. 
A tattoo? 
- Yeah, a tattoo. 
A woman in flames, hands up like this : 
Like a Biblical image. 
The Anima Sola? 
- The Anima Sola. 
That's what I saw. 
- It's a common archetypal image. 
I mean, it's the woman in chains, awaiting her fate. 
I'm talking about something I saw on the chest of a man. 
- That's what I saw. 
- You're in crisis. 
This image is tailor-made for your state of mind. 
A woman in purgatory. 
I need you to explain this to me, though. 
- Rachel did not commit suicide. 
- She jumped off a bridge. 
- When I saw her- - 
- She was washed downstream 5 miles. 
- She was cut up. 
- You saw her? 
- I saw her. Someone did that to her! 
- Police, newspapers, coroner wrong? 
- Let's reopen the case. 
- Maybe they should! 
- I saw her. And she's connected to me. 
- Delusions, hallucinations... 
- How, I don't know. 
-... disorganized speech, incoherence- - 
Don't rattle off your psychiatric shit! 
I know it like the back of my hand! 
Good. 
Saves me the trouble. 
Glass cells are having electrical problems. 
I'm gonna transfer you to a Psych Ward cell. 
One strike, you're going to solitary. 
Don't screw up. 
Rachel Parsons was there. 
Dead or alive, I don't know. 
That girl came to me. 
She came to me. 
Hi, Chloe. 
I'm sorry. 
I need you to tell me who did this to you. 
Tell me his name, Chloe. 
Chloe, tell me. 
Tell me anything. Tell me. 
I'll tell you one thing : 
He can have my body but he will never have my soul. 
Never. 
The devil. 
It's okay. 
He said you're next. 
- Try to stay awake. 
- Yes, ma'am. 
If you need me, I'll be in the coffee room. 
Lights out. 
Leave me alone! 
- Doesn't even look like a real ant. 
- It's got disco balls for eyes. 
-' 50s B movies, man. 
- Giant bug movies are great. 
Hey, what is that? 
It's Dr. Grey. She's trying to kill herself. 
Level C, we've got suicidal behaviour in cell 33. 
Sending backup. 
Open it! 
Dr. Grey's in trouble! 
Number 33, open it now! 
Oh, damn. Damn, what a mess. 
- Hold her, I'll medicate her. 
- What the hell for? 
She's already out. 
Don't argue with me. 
Jesus! Easy, easy. No, don't hurt me. 
Stop her! 
She's got my keys, stop her! 
Shit! 
Hey! Hey! 
Wait! Hey! 
We got a runner! 
Inmate escaping! Block Three! 
- Stay with me. 
- All right. 
She's gone this way. Let's go! 
Clear! 
Split up! Keep moving! 
She's going up the North Tower! 
Shit! 
Hey! It's already open! 
She's on the upper level! 
Hold it right there! 
- Dr. Grey! 
- We're on Three, she's heading for One! 
Go! Go! 
Go the other way! 
Circle back. 
Come on, Hank. 
Don't think she made it to this building anyway. 
Yeah, but even so, there's no way she can get out. 
Hide-and-seek. The longer it lasts, the more overtime we make. 
- You should be a professor. - Professors nail the pretty students. 
Let's go. I don't think she's in here. 
I got it. 
Is it clear there? 
We checked corridors Four and Five. 
- We're headed to Six and Seven. - Yeah. It's Joe, up at the desk. 
- What's going on down there? 
- Looks dark down there. 
What do you mean, what do I mean? 
Look, this is the fourth time this month this has happened. Never mind. 
- Ye-- Thank you. 
- Finally. 
- Took long enough. 
- Shit. 
Hey, Joe. 
You see something? 
Yeah, just now when the monitors came on. 
Corridor Six, something flashed in front of the camera. 
Frank, East Wing. Don, take the West. 
I'll take the stairs. 
Here, take my car. 
Go. Go. 
Go on. 
What do you want from me? ! 
Okay. Now what? 
Miranda, no! 
Doug? 
No. No, Miranda, no. 
Miranda, don't! 
No, don't, please! 
Please! No! Miranda, no! 
Please! Don't do this to me! No! 
Don't! No! Miranda, no, wait! 
Don't do this to me, please, Miranda! 
Miranda, no! Don't! No! 
Don't do this to me, Miranda! Miranda, please! 
I love you. 
What did I do? 
Why? 
Why me? 
Why? 
Why? 
Willow Creek. 
How was Willow Creek? 
This rain is slowing the work down. It's a big damn mess. 
I'll see you in a couple of days. 
It's good to be God. 
I love you. 
- Drop the knife! 
- Drop the gun! 
Put it on the ground now! 
- Drop the gun! 
- Drop the knife! 
- You drop it! - Holy Christ. 
What? 
Help me, please! 
Help! 
Carter, get down here now! 
Help me, please! 
Please! 
All I can tell you is that the girl has been identified as Tracy Seavers. 
She was reported missing two weeks ago. 
She was found this morning by two patrolmen in Willow Creek at a farm belonging to Dr. Douglas Grey. 
She is now hospitalised. 
Can she speak? Has she told you anything? 
- We can't comment on that. 
- Are there others? 
We can't confirm that. Excuse me. 
Sheriff, is the FBI taking over this investigation? 
Why don't you ask the goddamn FBI? 
We need her at the hospital for medication. 
Consider house arrest pending trial, given the circumstances. 
Last night, your client dropped a guard assaulted a nurse, escaped from an institution, stole a car- - 
And saved a girl's life. 
- How did she know she was there? 
- I don't know. 
- But the point is- - 
- The woman is still a murder suspect! 
Come here. 
The FBI says there could be more victims. 
There were needles down there, a video camera. 
Once the press gets ahold of it, it'll get big and ugly. 
Now, I need some answers, and I'm running out of time. 
So your client isn't going anywhere until my team.... 
I need to talk to her. 
It's hard to believe Doug did something like this. 
We worked together a long time. 
I thought I knew him pretty well. 
How could I be so blind? 
Well, you weren't the only one, Phil. 
Do you think my daughter could also have been a victim of Doug's? 
Yes. 
That's what" not alone" means. 
Rachel was trying to tell me that she was not Doug's only victim. 
And all this time we thought our baby had committed suicide. 
You see even after she was gone.... 
Well.... 
What? 
I had this recurring dream about her. 
Eventually I took medication to block it out. 
What kind of dream? 
She was burning in flames, in terrible pain. 
I couldn't save her. 
I saw her exactly the same way, burning in flames. 
What does that mean? 
Miranda, I- - I.... 
I wouldn't look for a real-world explanation. 
It's a dream, a delusion. 
A delusion that we both seem to share. 
- Yeah. 
- Pete. 
I was just talking to Parsons. 
I've been wrong about everything until now. 
It's finally clear to me. The image is finally clear. 
The man raping women in prison is connected to the murders. 
It goes back to the Anima Sola tattoo. 
Miranda, you have to stop doing this. 
Do you understand me? 
Every time people start taking you seriously, you talk about delusions. 
I'm not deluded, Pete, I'm possessed. 
I don't believe in ghosts. 
Neither do I, but they believe in me. 
Great, just great. 
Let's go. Come on. 
I need to talk to Sheriff Ryan. 
He's working with the FBI team. He won't be back tonight. 
It's really important. 
I'll leave him a message. 
Thank you. 
Screw it. 
I got a message you wanted to talk to me? 
Yeah, Bob. 
I wanna talk to you. 
Maybe this time you can actually hear me. 
The last time, all you wanted to do was scream and yell and accuse me- - 
- Is this what you wanna talk about? 
- No. I wanna talk about the facts. 
They're a little different now, right? 
Do you know what happens to a small-town sheriff when the FBI takes over? 
- If you know anything, anything- - 
- Not alone. 
What? 
Not alone. 
I know what it means. 
There are two killers. 
Parsons and I both saw a girl burning in flames. 
Then I saw Chloe being raped by a man with an Anima Sola tattoo on his body. 
A woman burning in flames. 
Okay, it's crazy. I know it sounds crazy. 
Pete has told me it's crazy. 
- You told Pete? 
When? 
- Yes. 
Yes. 
This afternoon. 
Why? 
I don't think you're crazy at all. 
I don't know why he would dismiss it. 
- You actually saw this tattoo? 
- Yes, I saw it. On a man. 
I've heard of serial killers who hunt together. 
Classic mentor and disciple syndrome. 
So we're looking for the disciple? Who could it be? 
- I don't know. 
- You're a psychiatrist. 
What kind of guy would this have to be? 
Okay. 
He would have to be someone who grew up in a household that had an absent father. 
He developed an obsessive, over-dependent relationship with his mother which then turned into some inappropriate sexual attraction. 
He probably even got off torturing little animals as a kid. 
And as a man he is totally confused about his sexuality. 
That's who he is. 
Man, that's screwed up. 
But a guy like that could seem smart and normal, right? 
Yeah, they usually do. Yeah. 
Look, Miranda, I don't wanna scare you but if there is a second killer out there he is frantically trying to cover his trail. 
You're a big threat to this guy. Who knows how much more you know? 
I don't know anything else. 
You saw the tattoo, found the girl at the barn. 
Yeah, but I found all that by instinct. 
This guy is facing the electric chair. 
He doesn't have the luxury of believing in instinct or ghosts. 
He's gotta believe that Doug confessed to you what he was doing. 
But he didn't confess. 
Maybe he didn't spill it out loud, but.... 
Well, you know, you're a psychiatrist. 
There's a lot of ways to confess. 
I'm just trying to put myself in this guy's place. 
Then why didn't he go back to Willow Creek? 
- Take care of the girl, clean up? 
- Yeah. 
Well, that's how you get caught. 
You panic. 
Better to let the dust settle. 
But about you... 
-... he's desperate. 
- Yeah? 
Desperate enough to talk to me? 
Well, you're right. 
I do fit the profile. 
Long-time friend of Doug's, access to the prison. 
I never did get a kick out of torturing animals, though. 
Stop it! 
- No! 
- Yes! 
- You can't kill me! 
- I'm not gonna kill you. 
After this kicks in, I'm gonna have a lot more fun with you than Doug ever did. 
Help! 
Miranda! 
Damn it! 
Help me! Help! 
Help me! 
Okay. 
You tried to escape, Miranda. 
That means I can do whatever I want to you. 
Rachel wasn't the first, you know. 
Doug killed a girl when he was 15 years old! 
I helped him bury the body. 
What are best friends for? 
We got older. 
But I gotta tell you you never lose your taste for the young girls. 
Then we stopped for a long time. 
But then Dougie saw sweet Rachel and.... 
That was an itch way too deep not to scratch. 
And then we had the time of our lives out at Willow Creek. 
Everything was perfect. 
Those girls would do anything. 
We were their god. 
Until you- - 
Miranda! 
You and I both know you're not getting out of here. 
So let's be logical and end this thing. 
Thank you, Miranda. 
Rachel? 
This isn't logical. 
You're already dead! 
Logic is overrated. 
I'm sorry, Miranda. 
So it's been almost a year and I still have bad dreams. 
Sometimes I wake up screaming. 
That's normal. 
No, not these dreams. 
Everyone thought you and I were crazy but we were seeing the truth. 
More than they could see. 
Once you open the door, you can never close it. 
Not true. I closed it. 
Then I locked it and then I threw away the key. 
I really hope that's true. 
You know, my train leaves in half an hour. 
Okay. I'll get you on your way. 
So good luck with your job, okay? 
I wanted to thank you for what you did. 
You really helped me. 
You helped me. 
You taught me how to listen. 
Thank you. 
We made it. 
No! 
Excuse me. 
So nobody noticed anything? 
She turned and burned like everyone else around here. 
Last person waited on her around 2 : 30. 
Hotel policy, never wake a guest poolside. 
Okay, so where are the attendants now? 
All righty. Looks like a dried roast. 
We got a bullet wound to the back of the head here. 
Sniper? No, I think I see a stellate wound, so that makes it close range. 
Publicly. 
Who would risk a murder like this... in front of all these people in broad daylight? 
Someone who wanted to make it public. 
Guy's got to be crazy. 
Not that crazy. 
1x19 Double Cap 
Well, she traveled light. 
But well. 
Three hundred dollar Helen Kaminski tote bag. 
Ooh, and look at her ring. 
Yes, an emerald. 
Cleopatra's favorite gem. 
Oval cut, too. 
Shark's choking on everything. 
The grid search offered up six sprinkler heads, a bottle cap, and a spoon. 
Bottom line, no casings. 
So either the shooter used a revolver... or they were smart enough to pick up the cartridge. 
Alexx, can you characterize the wound? 
Definite searing. 
Barrel to skin? 
This may have been an execution. 
Or a very good imitation. 
It seems real to me. 
It's the victim that's wrong. 
You mean female? 
See you back at the post, ladies. 
Nice going. 
Caine? 
Front desk says the victim's name is Gloria Tynan. 
She regular or strange? 
She checks into the penthouse suite every Tuesday with a guy. 
Nobody knows his name. 
Okay, so let's keep the cleaning crew out... of there until my guys get here. 
There's more. 
Her hotel bill's always paid in cash. 
Paid for a penthouse in cash, and yet we only found ten dollars in her purse. 
First she checked out, then went to the pool. 
Front desk says it's part of her routine. 
Wasn't routine today, was it? 
Hey, check it out. 
We on TV? 
No, it's Alexx. 
It's the crime scene. 
We were just down there. 
That means that security might have caught our shooter in the act. 
Yeah, I got to get my hands on today's footage. 
Hey, there's no way you're getting out... of processing this hotel room with me. 
Why would I try to do that? 
I love hotel rooms. 
Body fluids everywhere. Good. 
Glove up. 
Movies on command, got a full bar. 
It's definitely the way to go. 
Something tells me the mini-bar isn't the reason to come up here. 
Bed's made. 
Maybe they did it on the spread. 
Hey, I got a partial here. 
Gonna be thousands of those. 
Yeah, this one had a glaze. 
Might be fresh. 
Got some porn here. 
Get out of here. 
A girl that hot? 
Guy had to be a viagra case. 
So the suspect's probably over forty. 
You know what, I'm going to go watch those surveillance tapes. 
Don't digitize that one by mistake. 
Okay, gentlemen, I'm going to need y'all to show me your hands. 
I'll show you anything you want. 
Well, aren't you accommodating? 
What's this for? 
There was a woman who was murdered on y'all's shift, poolside. 
Is this yours? 
Yeah. 
It's pretty. 
It's delicate. 
You don't have a tan line. 
I only wear it at the end of my shift. 
After you take it off a victim? 
She has black crystal earrings that match. 
Look, it was laying on her towel, okay? 
I didn't touch her. You don't have to touch somebody to shoot them. 
Possible intercourse. I collected samples. 
Okay. 
Let's look for DNA from a potential suspect. 
And what about the gunshot wound? 
Turns out it's two. 
Clustered. 
Pros tap twice. Up close and personal, don't they? 
Then we are dealing with a pro. 
Shooter pressed the barrel against her skull jerks from the first impact, fires again. 
Two bullets. 
Along with this. 
Rubbery consistency. 
Let me get this to trace. 
Anything steel or metal, Alexx? 
Such as? 
Maybe like from a suppressor. 
Suppressor would explain... why nobody at the pool heard the big bang-bang... but no, just lead. 
Okay, her ten card, as soon as you can. 
If you tell me your theory. 
Okay, pretty girl, two taps to the back of the head. 
Worlds collide. 
Hi. 
I have a suspect I'd like you to visit. 
He swiped our lady's wristwatch at the pool. 
Homicide has him in holding. Okay. 
It looks like you may have a minor-league thief on your hands. Really? 
Yeah, pending evidence. 
Excuse me. 
Duquesne. 
Yeah, okay. I'll be there as soon as I can break away. 
Thank you. 
I need you to take a look at the bullets we extracted from the victim. Sure thing. 
Particular attention to the striations. 
Do you mind if I run a quick errand before I do? No. 
Okay. 
Thanks. 
How do you like that Agramonte color surveillance? 
Not your average liquor store security. 
$ 250,000 digital system. 
Just pulled it off DAT. 
Here's your victim, Gloria Tynan. 
She's spending a weekday... lounging by the pool at the Agramonte. 
What am I doing here? 
You're making a difference in your community. 
That's the last visual of her, from any angle. 
Okay, so the cabana hides her. 
Next time we see her, she's being carried out in a body bag. 
But you can tell she asks the attendant for a phone. 
Which one is he? 
Hugo. 
Simpkins in trace said... that we didn't find any GSR on any of the pool guys. 
Is that a cell phone on the ground? Zoom, zoom, zoom. 
Why would she ask for a hotel land line... when she's got a cell phone next to her? 
Battery dead? I don't think so. 
I'm going to get into it. 
Study every pixel. 
Hey, Dana. 
Thank you. 
Hey, dad. 
Lambchop... well, look at you. 
Here I am. 
Yeah. 
Were you singing songs for the customers? 
Oh, well, nothing that they haven't ardently requested of me. 
How about I give you a ride home? 
I walked here. 
Well, I realize that, dad. 
How about you walk me out to my car? Why, certainly. 
Okay. Good night, all. 
A gentlemen may never refuse the request of a lady. 
Let your old dad take you out to dinner. 
We'll go to that restaurant in coral gables... that your mama's always talking about. 
I can't, dad. I'm working. Now? 
Yeah. 
Get in the car. I've got to go back to CSI. 
You know, you are much too pretty to work as hard as you do. 
I know you think you just paid me a big old compliment, but... 
But nothing. 
You are. 
Beautiful since the day you were born. 
Beautiful girl. 
Okay, come on. 
I'll let you sit in the front. 
I miss you, Calleigh. 
I'm here right now, dad. 
Getting a hit off of our victim's ten card? 
AFIS. 
I've got lots of partials. I'm still trying to make sense of them. 
Look at this. 
Regal Harbor Boat Tours. Place of employment. That's weird. 
I've never seen that on a general file before. 
Gloria's been flagged. What? 
Why? 
I don't know. 
Take a look at this. 
These are our friends in DC. That's a 202 area code. 
Yeah, you want me to contact them? 
I think we just did, by accessing this file. It's cross-referenced. 
Could be DEA, FBI... 
I figure we got about two hours before... we get a visit by somebody in a suit and a pair of ray-bans. 
Everything okay? 
Yeah, it's fine. 
You sure? 
Sometimes it's difficult to have family. 
Sometimes, it's more difficult not to. 
True. 
Okay. Interesting striations? 
I fired this projectile out of a standard.22, like the one they used on Gloria. 
A single set of striations. 
But the one pulled out of Gloria had two sets. 
Confirming silencer. 
Yes, but it was a weird one. 
You know that substance you sent to trace? It was neoprene. 
So this is what I think happened. 
Well, I mean, you know, anyone with half a brain can build a silencer, so the suspect attached metal tubing to the end of the barrel, and then filled the suppressor tube around it with bronze, wool, 
and lithium grease to dissipate any expulsion of gasses... and to keep the explosion down, and then, finally, capped it all off with a black neoprene washer. 
So you have one set of striations from the barrel another set from the silencer,... and then, finally, the washer fragments to silence any escaping sound. 
Did you run these bullets through IBIS? 
I did. 
And the first set of striations matches an unsolved... four-year-old armed robbery in Uleta. 
Who was the case detective? 
Your sister-in-law. 
Family. 
Hi. 
Hi. 
I'll meet you at my desk. 
Okay. 
Here's the file you called me about. 
You remember this case? 
Oh, yeah. 
Savings and Loan in Uleta. 
Two suspects, ski masks, twenty-twos, terrorized the tellers and got away with 600 k in cash. 
How about eyewitnesses? 
Teller noticed a dark mole on one of the suspect's neck. 
Only other one brave enough to look at them was a security guard. 
They shot him in the head. Twice. 
Father of three. 
I really wanted to give his widow something. 
A year and half later, I can't even bring her a name. 
I think I may be able to. 
Somebody slapped a silencer on the weapon that was used in your robbery, and yesterday, at the Agramonte Hotel, the same MO was used to execute a woman. 
Yeah, I saw that on the news. 
A lot of people did. 
You're thinking this is some kind of a wake-up call? 
From one of the guys who pulled my S L job. 
I think there's a chance of it. 
Okay, what's the vic's name? 
She's been flagged by Washington, so I can only tell you who she isn't. 
This is going to help. So thank you. 
Gloria Tynan of Miami-Dade county, her only court appearance... is for a noise complaint over her dog, a shih tzu named Toodles. 
A few speeding tickets. Car? 
Dodge neon. 
And a one-carat emerald. 
She also reported a theft a half year ago at her job. 
Regal harbor boat tours, I'm guessing. 
Turns out Jeff Gabler's father owns the place, runs a day tour to the keys and back. 
Wait a second. Jeff Gabler, Lieutenant Gabler from narco? 
Yeah. 
Anyway, she filed a report, said someone lifted her wallet. 
Cops never found the guy. 
That's because there is no guy. 
We are being detoured into the land of make-believe. 
You're talking about the Feds? 
When they put you under protection, for whatever reason, they make up a backstory based on cops, and cops' families. 
Because they'll keep the story straight. 
Hold on a second. 
Horatio. 
Hey, I'm at the hotel checking the, phone records here. 
And there's one call... that Gloria Tynan made from a poolside phone, land line. 
I figured there's some reason she didn't use her cell. 
Okay, that's because she didn't want anybody to know. 
Right, so I cross-checked it, and I got an address. 
Coconut Grove, 2420 Lyons Avenue. 
Okay, nice work. 
I'll call Hagen. All right. 
Yesterday afternoon, a woman by the name of Gloria Tynan was murdered. 
Do you know her? No. 
I... 
I don't think so, why? 
We traced a phone call that she made from the Agramonte hotel... to your address. 
I don't know... 
Where you got that name. 
Gloria. 
It's Gina. 
This is my daughter. 
I haven't seen her in over a year. 
But you knew she lived here in Miami, didn't you? 
I didn't know where. 
Because she couldn't tell you. 
Did she have a man in her life? 
She was... seeing this guy in Pennsylvania... 
Did you know his name? 
She just... always called him her boyfriend. 
He showered her with gifts. 
He tried to buy me. 
I didn't like that. 
But you made an exception in this case. 
I notice you're wearing the same ring she did. 
He made me feel... if I didn't take it, like he would be offended. 
Maybe even... hurt me or Gina. 
Um, I'm, I, I... 
I don't know how to explain it. I think you just did a very nice job. 
Do you have the box the ring came in? I... 
I could look. 
You move in recently, Mrs. Cusack? 
Three months ago. Gina sent me a letter in Philly asking me to move to Florida. 
Even helped with the rent. 
I told her this house was way over my head. 
Look at all this glass. 
But you didn't see her? 
She calls me every Tuesday. 
Same time. 
Promised that... she was going to be able to see me soon. 
On that cordless phone? Why? 
What's wrong with the phone? Nothing at all. 
Can you find who did this to Gina? I'm going to do my best. 
And this... is really going to help. 
It was a legitimate question, the cordless. 
One we already had the answer to. 
Why add to the lady's guilt? 
Town car, tinted windows, take a guess. 
Fan Belt Inspectors? Nope, U.S. Marshals, 
Witness Protection, baby-sitters. 
I guess I couldn't help but notice your car over here. 
U.S. Deputy Marshal Ardine. 
Marshal, I just got this off Gina Cusack's mom. 
I was going to run it for prints on the boyfriend, but after all is said and done, it would just spit out background info... from your imagination. 
Right? 
All part of protecting our witness. Yes, from Philly, deals in swag. 
I think I have an idea, but why don't you tell me how Gina ties in to your witness? 
Let's just say he's a married man, and she's not his wife. 
So you put his mistress into the program, but didn't protect her. 
We protected her. 
Gave her a new identity, a job, a new life near our primary. 
It's not our fault she broke protocol, contacted her mother, dragged her down from Philly. 
Should have checked mom's phone. 
Did. 
House has a secure land line. 
Single cordless phone. 
So Gina's killer sat out here with a receiver, and picked up the radio waves... from the cordless and tracked her to the Agramonte hotel. 
So you guys slipped up and Gina paid. 
Nice going. Hey! 
Don't go digging around this, huh? 
We don't want our witness spooked. 
A professional hit... was made on a girl that he brought to Miami. 
So maybe he got bored with her, and maybe I'll find his prints on this. 
Either way, I'll get him next. You're way off. 
Left field. Am I? 
Marshal? 
Is that why you're here? 
That's two. 
One still out there. 
Red one in the middle is from the gift box. 
It's the only one that didn't belong to Gina or her mom. 
'Kay, what about the hotel? 
All these little green ones. 
It's pretty messy. 
I'm trying to combine them to get one workable print. 
Narrowed it down to three sets of ten. 
But these hotel rooms are going to force me into early retirement. 
Come on, I know you're out there. 
There it is. 
Take it to the house. Double loop, minimal distortion. 
Let's run it. Running it. 
Here we go. Edward Hinkle. 
Husband to Mary, father of Jessica. 
Social security number, places of employment, last four addresses. 
What about that 202 fed number? 
That's nice and tidy, courtesy of uncle... 
Speak of the devil. 
Well, if it isn't the wizard from behind the curtain. 
Marshal Ardine tells me you're barking up a dangerous tree. 
You wouldn't happen to know where Edward Hinkle is, would you? 
With us, preparing to testify in a federal trial... against his former drug suppliers. 
Oh, yes, against the Colombians. 
He's helping us defeat a small army... we've never had a chance to get near till now. 
Case went nowhere for three years... till we got Hinkle to squawk. 
What about the murder in Uleta... during the robbery of a savings and loan? 
Thank you. I don't know what you're talking about. 
Eighteen months ago, two hard guys popped a square badge, made off with the cash, and you know what they say : 
You lie down with the devil, you wake up in hell. 
I didn't know anything about this, Horatio, I swear. 
We poly'd our witness before we put him under. He didn't have any outstandings. 
Well, actually, he must have lied to you, because he does. 
Are you sure about this? 
Yeah, I am. 
See this mole right here? 
Well, there's an eyewitness in Uleta... that remembers it quite well, too. 
So, you've got the same gun, two shots to the head, just like Gina. 
Yeah, it's Sackheim. 
Checking on the status of protectee Ed Hinkle. 
We've got eyes on him, correct? 
All right. 
Keep me posted. 
Guess we've got a small Wrinkle. 
Sounds like it. 
He must have seen your, uh... hotel hit on the evening news and took a walk. 
So Mr. Hinkle's in the wind? 
I'm sure it's just temporary. 
U.S. Marshals are on it right now. 
Okay, let's go talk to the wife, then Mrs. Hinkle. 
I'm sure you've got her stashed away somewhere. 
Yeah. 
I'll make some calls. 
Good. 
Come on. 
Hey, Claudia. 
Can I get my messages, please? 
Oh, tulips. 
Those are beautiful. 
I love tulips. I know. 
Hey, dad! 
Hi, sweetie. 
Those aren't necessary. 
Yes, they are. 
Thanks for getting me home. Take a walk with me. 
You know I don't like to lecture, because as far as I'm concerned, everyone chooses their own path. 
I'm just saying, maybe you should cut back. I'm going to. 
I mean that. 
Dad... 
I don't expect you to believe me. 
Hey, Cal. 
Hey, Tim. 
All right, well, I'll let you get back to work. Okay. 
See you. 
Thanks for the flowers. You bet. 
We have reason to believe she was with your husband... just prior to her murder. 
Gina? 
Gina from Philly? 
Yes. You guys brought her down here, too? 
Her relocation was arranged also, yes. 
I can't believe she was down here with us. 
I can't believe you did this to me. 
Ma'am, I'm with the Miami Crime Lab and not the... FBI. 
Can you tell me where your husband might be? Frank? 
Probably out spending his cash... 
" Ed," ma'am, please. 
His alias is" Ed." We've worked very hard to... 
Ed, Frank. Gotrocks, Mr. I-deal-in-cash-only, whatever, all right? 
Ma'am, could you talk about his cash? 
He squirreled money away. 
What, in addition to the stipend we gave him to get settled? 
He has stacks of money. 
I just don't know where. 
Did he ever give you any? 
He never did in Philly. I don't know why he would start now. 
I sneak it... out of his wallet when he's sleeping. 
Do you have any on you now? 
What if I did? 
I could catch him with it. 
Tell Frank... if he hadn't kept Gina... 
I never would've done this. 
Hi, honey. What are you up to, huh? Excuse me. 
I'll be right over there. I have customers. 
Hi. 
Hi. 
What are you working on? 
A farm with cows and a pony and some lambs. 
It's pretty. 
I could draw you one. 
Right now I have to go back to work, but I could come back another time... and you could draw me one. 
Will you really come back? 
You know what? 
For you, I'll come back. 
Okay? Keep up the good work. 
I've been watching these pool attendants work. 
They all kneel when they serve a guest. 
None of them wear sunglasses,'cause the hotel insists on... establishing eye contact with the guests. 
Except this guy. 
No kneeling, lousy tan. 
And you're sure it's not Ed Hinkle, our federal witness. Nah. 
I compared it to his DMV photo. 
Watch this guy make his way over to the cabana. 
Now watch his stack of towels. 
Each time he ducks behind the cabana, he reappears, there's one less towel. 
There's seven left. 
Six left. Five. 
Now here's Gina. 
Five still. 
He doesn't give her one. 
Well, he had something else for her. 
Maybe he left something behind. 
James Fukes. 
He did six years prison time in coal township, Pennsylvania. 
Armed robbery in Philadelphia. 
He hijacked a truckload full of high-end electronics. 
Five-eleven, 185, dark hair. 
Well, if you don't believe the video, believe the DNA, he's our shooter. 
Okay, let's call up his known associates. 
There are none. 
Yes, there are... but the Feds have deleted them. 
You've got to understand... the magnitude of the witness protection program. 
You've got DOJ, DEA, you've got the marshals over here dealing with the paper trail. 
We Fibbies, we just deal with the trial. 
So not even you knew that Frank was Jimmy's old partner. No. So... 
Jimmy Fukes has the gun they used in the armed robbery... they pulled together. 
Yes, in Uleta... Jimmy got the gun ; Frank got the money. 
And now Jimmy's in town for his cut of the proceeds. 
By placing Frank in the program, he got out of paying Jimmy. And by killing Gina, 
Jimmy sent a message to Frank to pay up. 
And now they're both in the wind. Yeah. 
And so, when we find the money, we'll find them. 
All the bills you got from Frank's wife... traces of cotton fiber, dust, chrysanthemums. 
Wait a minute. 
You mean like the plant? It's impregnated in all U.S. Paper currency to reduce bacteria levels. 
But this one bill, bottom of the stack, it has an additional trace. 
A peroxygen compound, combined with a surfactant. 
A synthetic soap. 
Add malic acid, you get virkon. 
Exactly. 
New disinfectant introduced last year... to combat cruise-ship viruses. They use it on all kinds of boats now, right? 
Regal Harbor Boat Tours. 
Right. So Frank asked Gina to stash his cash at work. 
That's why it was only on one bill. 
The bottom one. So she's in charge of the cash. 
When Frank finds out she's dead... He jumps on this afternoon's tour boat to grab his money. 
Round trip to the keys ; 
no stops. 
So if he makes it on the boat there's no getting off... should be back after the Regal Sunset Dinner. 
Okay, call Hagen and tell him to meet me there. 
Okay. What about Sackheim? 
This is the one. Stand by. 
Nobody moves until we see him. 
Folks, on" go." 
Waiting on a visual. 
I don't see him. 
There he is. 
We got him. White ball cap. 
Move! 
Oh, hey. 
I'm not the Taliban over here. 
Sir, you're going to have to come with us. 
What are you talking about? 
I was on a cruise I was... 
You should call Special Agent Sackheim, FBI. 
I'm part of a high top-secret operation against some Colombians, huh? 
Anti-American drug dealers. 
Yeah, you're a real patriot. 
Know a Savings and Loan that's been missing this. 
Let go of my witness. As soon as he gives me Fukes, I'll let him go. 
He testifies in 48 hours. 
This can happen quickly. 
If you're proposing what I think and Fukes kills my witness... 
Fukes wants his money. 
He's not going to touch anybody. 
Frank left a message on Jimmy's home machine in Philly at what time? 
10 : 58 P.M. 
It's 7 : 30 A.M., people. 
If he's here in Miami, he may never check it. 
Okay, he is not on vacation. 
This is business. Don't worry, Jimmy checks his machine more often than he blinks. 
It's him. 
Land line. Keep him on. 
This is your friend from Philly. 
What are you, Pauly Walnuts? 
I know who you are, Frank. 
Let's do this. 
You screwed me. And you got my attention. 
Pick a place. 
You're rolling over on me, aren't you, Frank? What, do you think I'm stupid? 
Did we get him? 
No. 
All right. 
Frank gave it his best shot. 
Come on. 
We've got testimony to run. 
My suspect is still at large. 
I want to hear about Jimmy Fukes. 
I might have met him once. 
He killed my girlfriend. What do you want me to say? 
I want you to tell me the truth. Not the fairy tale this nitwit gave you. 
Tell me the truth ; 
I've known him since kindergarten. 
We used to skip school together. Going down to the arcade, knock off some gumball machines. 
What did you do with the money? 
Go to the track, get a degenerate to bet a race for us. 
When we got older, women, rings... we both like the jewel tones. 
You bet the smart money? On the horses? 
No, no, no. 
Hey, I bet the winners. Jimmy still chases the, uh, the long shots. 
Five-to-one or better. 
Of course, he never finds them, but... 
People don't change, do they? 
Turf club after the seventh. 
Where's your car? 
Let's look for Pennsylvania tags, come on. 
Living in your car, Jimmy? 
A baby monitor. 
So I have kids at home. So what? There's only one reason a wise guy drives around... with a baby monitor. 
Of course it's beautiful. 
One day at a time in paradise. 
Come on, mom, you got to admit this beats wearing... three layers just to get to your mailbox. 
When am I going to see you, Gina? 
I came here to see you. 
Where are you? I'm at the Agramonte right now. 
You drove to the hotel, found her at the pool, and the costume party began. 
Is this for the kids at home, too? 
There's ten thousand guns just like that out there. 
You're not going to be able to prove a thing. 
That is a very dumb thing to say to a CSI. 
Now, Jimmy, you capped your silencer with neoprene. 
And trace results from Gina's autopsy... found rubber in her head, also neoprene. 
Your gun, your bullets, your crime. 
Frank was screwing me out of money. 
All right, the robbery was my idea. 
I scouted the place for months before. 
He just showed up on game day. Yes, but I am talking about another crime. 
And there is a detective... right on the other side of that glass... who is anxious to talk to you about the robbery in Uleta. 
But that's going to have to wait. 
Hang out. 
When you're done, we'll process him over at county. 
Uleta is going to want to try him first. Okay, we'll wait our turn. 
Security guard's wife is going to want to thank you. 
Horatio? 
Thanks. 
Lieutenant Caine... 
I'll catch up with you. 
Yeah? 
We have a Wrinkle. 
I'm listening. 
I was just speaking to Washington. 
You have got to be kidding me. 
The decision's from higher up. This guy killed an innocent girl and a father of three children. 
Yeah, well, his attorney says... he's willing to help us build a case against Joseph Berkeley. 
An alleged hit man for the Mastello Crime Family. I know who he is. Jimmy's testimony... could tie a dozen murders to this assassin. 
What about the two lives I am looking out for down here? 
The AG's personally making this call. 
Details are being worked out. It's going to happen. 
Look, I know it's tough. 
Do you? 
You got a minute? 
Claudia, I tell you, they're wearing me out. 
Do you have the evidence for the Hannagan case? Thank you. 
Duquesne. 
Hi, Calleigh. 
It's Dana over at the Whiskey Stop. 
Okay. I've stopped serving your dad and he's refusing to take a cab home. 
I'll be there as soon as I can break away. 
Thanks. Thank you. 
What can I get for you, sir? 
I, um... I just wanted to say hi to Mary Hinkle and her daughter. 
Are they here? 
Well, Mary quit this morning. Said she and her little girl were headed out west. 
You with the Miami-Dade Police Department? 
Uh, yeah. She thought you might drop by. 
Said you over-tipped her. 
Well, good for them. 
Good for them. 
[ Captioning Sponsored by CBS ] 
Well, this is me. 
That's right. 
Are you okay? 
Yeah. 
You okay to drive? What, do I seem...? 
Happy? 
I haven't seen that smile on your face in a while. 
Yeah. 
You know, for the past two years, every morning when I wake up, 
I'd have this thought that comes to my head : 
Raymond is dead. 
And now, in these... in these past few weeks, 
it's just not the first thing I think of. 
You going to bring Ray Junior tomorrow? 
Is that all right? Yeah. 
Looking forward to it. Good. Thank you. 
Good night. 
Good night. 
Drive safe. 
Detective Caine? 
Can I help you? 
Pete Wilton. Knocked off a chain of grocery stores about six years ago? 
You caught me in Liberty City? 
I remember, Pete. Good Samaritan got hit and you got manslaughter, right? 
Yeah, and your testimony helped put me away. 
Is that why you've been following me? 
I'm two years into my parole, and I've got a problem. 
Pete, if you make that move, it's going to be your last. 
Relax, Lieutenant, it's a photograph. 
Take it out. 
It's my son. Jeff. 
Went to school three days ago and never came back. 
You call 911? 
Yeah, I went to PD, but they're not too concerned with parolees' kids. 
He's not the way I used to be. 
I know that something happened to him. 
Okay, well, I'm sure... the detectives are on it. Let me call. No. 
Look, I was guilty. 
And you knew it. You came after me with everything you had. And I saw that. 
I know you can find my boy. 
What kind of trouble was he in? 
None. Really. 
No, I just figured if you could bulldog a guy like me, you could do half as good with a good kid. 
Worth saving. 
Okay, Pete, listen to me. 
If you're lying, I'm out. 
You understand? 
I do. 
Thank you. 
Right, right, he backed up into your knife eleven times. 
Sit tight, Kilroy... while I, uh, rustle up some booking slips. 
Got a minute? 
Thirty seconds. 
Okay, Jeff Wilton. 
Who? 
Jeff Wilton is a high school kid from homestead... that disappeared three days ago. 
Father's an ex-con. 
And a concerned parent. A divorced parent. 
Soon as he got out, wife took off, left the kid behind. 
Told the neighbor she liked the guy fine enough, as long as he was in prison. 
You think the kid did the same thing? 
No, I think Jeff's in the keys with a cheerleader. 
I think he'll run out of money, stroll back in a couple of days with a hickey on his neck and a smile on his face. 
What if he doesn't? 
I got twelve confirmed dead yanking at my chain right now. 
So you're not interested in the kid unless he's dead? 
You know what I mean. 
Okay, Frank, why don't you let me take this one off your hands. 
There's no crime scene to investigate. 
Maybe not, but that doesn't mean there wasn't a crime. 
1x20 Grave Young Men 
I want to be sure I got it right. 
You and the deceased had drinks last night, came back here around midnight... 
Made love... 
for... I don't know how long. 
And when I woke up this morning, he was beside me... dead. 
Thanks. 
Bernstein? 
Speedle. 
Who are you? 
I'm a Crime Scene Investigator. 
I thought you were the Detective. 
I am. But Speedle analyzes the scene. 
The forensic that might explain the death in question. 
Do you have any questions for me? 
Yeah. 
Why do women do that to their nails? 
What? 
Put little charms on them? It's easy. To attract men. 
Hey, do you mind taking that tea... and drinking it over there? 
Sure... whatever helps. 
Well, the guy was in good shape. 
She said he runs marathons. Well, ran. 
May have an enlarged heart. 
Something of the pulmonary nature. 
Frenulum isn't torn. 
Tardieu spots in the conjunctivae and eyelids. 
Asphyxiation? 
Sleep apnea? Hard to tell. 
Almost impossible to distinguish accidental from homicide. 
Result of closing off the air to the windpipe's the same. 
Blood stops carrying oxygen to the alveoli. 
I'd say he fell asleep in his pillow. If I hadn't watched Miss Thing... put her suave on Bernstein earlier. 
This is Jeff's room. 
I didn't touch anything. 
Left everything just the way it was the morning he left for school. 
Okay. You know, Pete, I am going to take you up on that coffee now. Sure. 
Okay. 
Make it two, if you don't mind. You got it. 
" Three-in-one oil." 
Used to use that to make boat models. 
Now I use it to clean my gun. 
What do we have here? 
" Four Twenty Boyz." 
Time to get high, I bet. 
How do you know that? 
My brother worked narcotics undercover. 
So, Jeff... where is it? 
Our friend Jeff is a stoner. 
His father lied. 
You see, kids make excellent criminals. 
They're sneaky. 
Here's how it might've gone. 
Jeff sits up here at night, in the dark, without his dad being any the wiser. 
This is gunshot residue. And it's possible... 
Jeff... was doing more... than smoking out this window. 
Wow, someone definitely used this tree for target practice. 
Not all the bullet holes are fresh, either. 
Calleigh, how many different weapons do you think have been used here? 
Well, I see nines,.22s, there's even some rifle action. 
I'll be able to tell you more when I get it back to the lab. 
Okay, so weed, bullets, let's go over to Jeff's high school locker... and see what other surprises he has for us. 
School property could take a day to get permission. 
Red tape. 
Cut through it as fast as you can. 
And the same goes for this tree. 
You're not going to roll him? 
Think our boy's been moved enough. 
Dual lividity. 
Body laid on its stomach, then was flipped over. 
The paramedics must've flipped him. 
No. 
No, he was on his stomach long enough for blood to settle. Couple of hours. 
But before that, he was dead on his back... another couple hours. 
Something or someone moved him into secondary position. 
Flip-flop usually means somebody can't decide to call 911... or skip town. 
I'm going to need to swab under your fingernails. 
Sure. 
How come? 
It's just part of the investigation. 
Am I a suspect? 
A witness. 
You're looking for Chuck's skin under my fingernails, aren't you? 
I try never to have expectations. 
Never disappointed. Smart. 
I might as well tell you, things got a little rough between Chuck and I... sexually. 
You saw me notice those scratches on your chest? 
He can get himself worked up. 
I'm going to need to, uh, photograph those markings, as well. 
Sure. 
This okay? 
Okay, um... sorry. 
Hey, how's it look? 
Like a starry, starry night. 
We've got rifle ammo, some buckshot. 
Come on in, take a look for yourself. 
No, I can't find another lead apron, and Alexx isn't around. 
Well, then, by all means, stay out. 
Calleigh, were you here at CSI when Horatio's brother was killed? 
Ray? Yeah, I was new. 
Keeping my head down. 
Why do you ask? 
No reason, I just, uh... I didn't realize his brother worked narco. 
Yeah. 
Undercover narco cop gets killed in the line of duty, might have been dirty, something like that. 
I didn't say that. 
Nobody ever does. 
Was he dirty? 
I don't know. 
I don't know what Raymond Caine was. 
I'm not entirely sure Horatio does, either. 
Wow... this tree has more lead than wood. 
You got nines there,.44s,.22s. 
There were over two hundred expended projectiles... that we couldn't see. 
So as the tree grew, the entrance holes grew over with living cells. 
.30 carbine, short rifle. 
760 by 39 also. 
A-K. This was not target practice ; this is training. 
This is training. 
Nice going. 
You lied to me, Pete. 
I didn't know about the bullets in the tree. 
The neighbors asked about the noise while I was at work. Jeff just said it was firecrackers. 
Then how do you explain the weed I found in his room? 
I didn't know he was into that. 
Let's ask your parole officer what he thinks. 
Are you kidding me? All that ammo? 
Son's probably training to knock off... a chain of markets just like his old man here. 
What happened? 
He borrowed your piece, and now you're a little worried he may get nervous... and drop it at a heist, huh? 
I don't have a piece. 
Right. You just got a hundred bullets in your backyard tree. Plus, the weed. 
Unless you want to make a case to the board... that this contraband is your son's, you're going back inside, and you're going to serve out the rest of your sentence. 
The gun and the weed are mine. Okay. 
So, he's all yours. Sold. 
729 days at stark. 
Let's go. 
My kid... is still out there. 
We brought you some lunch, but somebody here ate your fries. That's okay. 
So listen, Raymond, I have to go get a file. 
I'll be right back. 
Okay? 
How you doing? Good. 
Good. 
She doesn't need a file. She wants you to talk to me. 
That's right. 
She tells me... that you've been getting into fights at school. 
This kid in school said my dad was a bad cop. 
Well, you know what? That is not true. 
Your dad was a hero, but his job was to pretend he was a bad cop. 
See the difference? 
He said I have my dad's name. That's why I was bad. Let me tell you something. 
It's not important what people say about us. 
It's only important... what we know inside about ourselves. Do you understand? 
Yeah. 
All right. 
So, no more fights at school, because it upsets your mother. All right. 
Good man. 
Good man. 
I found the owner of one of the guns... that fired a bullet into the Wilton family tree. 
Nick Gordon, age 45. 
Six months ago, the gun was used to shoot out the scoreboard... at Antioch High School. 
Antioch. 
That's where Wilton's kid goes. 
So I called the principal, and found out that Ben Gordon, age 17, was responsible for shooting out the scoreboard. 
However, they believe that another kid was with him, but because of the privacy laws, they can't say anything. 
But the principal did hesitate... when I tried a name on for size. Of course. 
Jeff Wilton. Our parolee's son. 
Okay, let's get Ben Gordon and his father in here. 
You got it. 
Yeah? Yeah, it's Speed. 
All right, I'll be out there in a minute. 
Thanks for coming out. 
You going somewhere? 
Actually, um... there somewhere else we can talk? 
I have a photo shoot tomorrow in St. Thomas. 
You're a photographer? 
A model. 
Bathing suits. 
It's probably why I was so comfortable... when you wanted to take pictures of me. 
I realized later I might have been a little too casual. 
So your boyfriend dies... and you're able to go to work the next day? 
Chuck and I weren't married. I wasn't in his will. 
Yes, I need to make a living. 
Alison, did you move the body? 
Is that what the autopsy said? 
When I woke up, and he didn't respond, yes, 
I rolled him over on his back and called 911. 
Homicide has you calling 911 at 7 : 00 am. 
Paramedics show up at 7 : 08. 
It takes hours for lividity to form. 
Really. 
I did roll him over in the middle of the night. 
His arm was plopped over my head and I couldn't sleep. 
After I rolled him, 
I must have fallen right back to sleep. 
So he was already dead in the middle of the night. I suppose so. 
I read in Vanity Fair... that time of death could never be exact. 
Within hours. No. 
You can't go on your shoot. 
Tim... would you let me know what you find? 
I can't do that. 
Look, when it's, uh, appropriate, okay? 
No, first class on that equipment's as bad as business. Look into charters. 
Mr. Gordon. 
Look, I'm being pulled into something ; call me later. 
I thought you were supposed to bring your son in. I did, he's out front, having a smoke. 
I can't stop him ; 
he's right out there. 
Kid's been staring at dead bodies for ten minutes. Naturals, traumas. 
My first year mes would have passed out by now. 
Says he's here to see you. 
Okay, thank you. 
Ben. 
I'm Lieutenant Caine. Hey, you ever kill anyone? 
Uh, in the line of duty. 
You want to put that out, please? 
Thank you. It's an entrance wound, right? 
It's small because... the skin snaps back into place once the bullet passes through. 
You like guns. 
Yeah. They're cool. 
Jeff Wilton thinks guns are cool, too. 
Was Jeff with you when you shot out the scoreboard? 
No, I did that alone. 
You ever go shooting with Jeff? 
If I fired a gun, it wouldn't be at a stupid tree. 
What would you shoot at? 
The kid who killed Jeff. 
So you know Jeff is dead? 
Ben? 
If he was alive, he would have called me by now. 
Why don't you and your dad go have lunch for a couple of hours... and then come back, all right? 
Go ahead. 
Heard you were looking for me. 
Sleeping on the job? You a down man or a feather man? 
They aren't the same thing? 
Feathers are for flying ; 
down's for insulating. 
The more mature the down, the better air-trapping ability. It's called" loft." 
That would explain the scratches on Alison. 
Slow death. 
He had air between those feathers. Down. 
Goose, to be exact. 
That's one scenario. 
What'd you get? 
Chuck Maxfield died one day shy of his wedding. 
Alison never said anything about them getting married. They weren't. 
That might've been the problem. 
Chuck was marrying a girl from Coconut Grove. Reception was to have been tonight at the Delano. 
Did you talk to the bride? 
Mother. 
The girl was too broken up to talk, especially when she found out where the guy died. 
Never heard of her. She was his little secret. 
You know what we call that over at robbery homicide. 
Yep, motive. 
H, I processed the sneaker from Jeff's locker. 
Found soil in the tread. 
And? 
Soil's humus, high organic content, very low mineral content, with one significant man-made material, an epoxy called mastico. 
Repairing headstones. Headstones? 
Jeff's friend Ben. 
There's a recurring theme. 
I'm thinking Redeemer Cemetery. 
It's the oldest one in the county. 
Yes, and within walking distance of the high school. 
Looks like the last person buried here was 1968. 
First was 1860. 
Something wasn't buried here very recently. Decomp? 
Yeah. 
It's stronger from over here. 
Now... maggots will go to a wound. 
We have an exit wound, head. Sweet going in, and ugly going out. 
Got another one here in the back. This is an entry wound. 
Looks like an ambush. 
So much for me saying he was in the keys. 
You know what? 
Maybe he was, because this body was moved. 
You see, we got no blood spatter anywhere... but we do have... gravitational blood droplets on his clothes. 
Laid out like a Christmas package. 
Well, I'll pay a visit to our parolee Pete Wilton, let him know we found his son. 
I would hold off on that. 
This is not his kid. 
Boy's I.D. Says," Mark Hubbard." Born in 1986. 
Found his library card from Antioch High, and, yes, he was moved. 
I'll find you for the post. 
Particular attention to the fingernails, please. 
If there's an epithelial, I'll dig it out. 
Calleigh, check out what I found in here. 
The real damage is over here. Watch your step. 
High-velocity spatter, 
100-feet-plus per second... it's consistent with a gunshot. 
A shot in the back, right? 
Well, after his head's hit, he didn't go anywhere, so... trajectory suggests that he was bent over. 
And there's the projectile. I'm going to take that with me. 
Bat bag, crumpled. 
Maybe that's why he was bent over, reaching for it. 
Bat bag, scoreboard... maybe there's a theme here. 
Well, blood pool is here, so he was bleeding out. 
There's a second hit on the wall over here. 
Which means he managed to make his way over, and dropped to his knees. 
And was shot a second time. 
The suspect dragged him from here... to the cemetery. 
There was a third person here. 
Yeah, there's a void in the blood. 
Which also means... that there was someone behind the victim. 
Question is, the third guy was helping or hindering? 
I've got a cigarette... that might help us. 
Death mask. 
What's a death mask? 
That's Chuck's saliva. DNA confirmed it. 
And? 
Did you press his face into the pillow, causing him to suffocate? 
Yes and no. Alison... 
You're so sure I'm guilty. 
I could see it when you walked through the door. You have an explanation? 
Yes... I pressed his face into the pillow. 
No... I did not suffocate him. 
He did, however... orgasm. 
Excuse me? 
My marathon-running boyfriend was a pillow biter. 
Satisfied? 
He liked to give himself over to me. 
I, uh, could be more explicit, but... 
I get it. 
We role-played around... two in the morning. 
Then we drank some more wine. We snuggled. 
You okay? Yeah. 
Um... it's just that this job, it's weird uh, sometimes. 
You know, you learn certain things about people. 
You're interrogating our witness without me? 
No, I was just running a few questions by her. 
You interview her again, I better be there. It's protocol. 
You will be there. 
You got that? 
Lieutenant? Yeah? Results on those cigarette butts. 
Three separate donors. 
One matched the sample you gave me from Ben Gordon. Okay. 
Thank you. 
All right. 
There were weapons in this bag. Plural. Rifles. 
You don't use a bat bag just to carry handguns. 
Your son is in a great deal of trouble. 
He told me he was hanging out with Jeff Wilton. 
He admitted they were shooting guns... at Jeff's house, at the school. 
Did he tell you that he was at the cemetery... the morning that Mark Hubbard was killed? 
He told me they go there in the mornings, before school, for horseplay. 
I have a blood pattern, my friend, that says there were two people at the cemetery... when Mark was shot to death. 
So, are you the shooter, or was Jeff? 
I'm not saying anything about Jeff. 
Okay. Where are the guns? 
They carried their rifles in a bag and foolishly left it behind. 
Right? 
I can wait. 
We found this on the handle of the bat bag. 
It's the same as the t-shirt from Jeff's house. Okay, thank you. 
" The Four-Twenty Boyz." 
You, Jeff, and Mark, part of the Four-Twenty Boyz, Ben? 
Is that what time you guys used to get high every day? No. 
No? 
It's not a time ; 
it's a date. 
April 20... is what? 
Hitler's birthday, all around the world, the whole week. 
So we have Waco, the federal building, Columbine, and now Antioch. 
So you guys were planning an action, weren't you? 
No. Me and Mark backed out. 
Is that why Jeff shot Mark? 
I said I'm not going through with this. Tough. 
No take-backs. 
Forget it, Jeff. 
We're getting rid of the guns. 
We're going to break these down, bury them somewhere. 
I'm warning you. 
Jeff told me if I said anything... 
You talk, you die. 
Where is Jeff right now? At the mausoleum. 
He's not at the mausoleum. 
Where is he? 
Why don't you tell me what time you were due out of school? 3 : 00. 
But there's an assembly today after class. 
At 4 : 20. 
He's going to start shooting. 
Lieutenant Caine. 
Bill Roland, I'm the principal. 
Okay, Bill, SWAT team is on the way. 
Any sign of Jeff Wilton? None. 
He could have slipped into the assembly with the other students. 
Okay, I'm going to need everybody out... of the building right now. 
I don't want to create a panic. 
Something just did, Bill. 
Everybody out. 
Everybody out, Bill! I need everybody to leave the building right now! 
Hey, Jeff. 
Let's put the weapon down... and not make it any worse, okay? 
You have no idea what I've done. 
That's not true, Jeff. 
I know about the cemetery. 
And I know about Mark. Jeff, you can put a stop to this right now if you want to. 
You're right. 
I can stop. 
I want you to think about your dad. My dad didn't care about me. 
That's not true. 
That is not true, Jeff. 
He's back in jail for you. 
Lies. No, no. He took the gun rap. 
Two more years inside for you. 
He really went back in? He did, Jeff. 
Listen to me now, he came to me, and he asked me to find you. 
That's the truth, Jeff. 
Tell him I said thanks. Jeff. 
Jeff! 
Jeff, don't move. Do not move. 
I could have killed you. 
Yeah, but you didn't. 
We're clear. 
You're lucky no one died here, kid. 
Tox is in. 
Ethanol. 
Alcohol. 
Boyfriend was three times the legal limit. 
My guess is vodka. 
No smell. Would that amount, um, impede his sexual performance? 
Oh, honey, that amount of alcohol... would impede an elephant's sexual performance. 
Catch her in a lie? 
I have to take a look at the evidence. 
Hi. 
The guy was passed out on his back. 
You took a pillow... you put it over his mouth you pressed down as hard as you could, with these little hands... and this little charm. 
Probably for about five or six minutes. 
Would have taken less time with an inferior fill, but... only the best for you, right? 
I was glad when you called. 
It's crazy, huh? 
I mean, I knew... but still, I was glad. 
You've been playing me since day one. 
If you believed that... your partner would be here right now. 
I didn't think you heard us. 
People get smothered by pillows... accidentally. 
Yeah, but Chuck wasn't one of them. 
You should have let the guy get married. 
He was watching... from behind the mirror. 
I don't conduct interviews without my detective, ever. 
It's time to stand up, Alison. 
You're under arrest for the murder of Charles Maxfield. 
Can't believe you did this to me. 
Yes, you can. 
It's a sorry state. 
I'm just grateful to Lieutenant Caine... that only one person was killed. 
I'm sorry I let you down, dad. 
No. No, I let you down. 
But you killed someone, and you're going to have to pay for that... the rest of your life. 
I want you to think about that... hard. 
Every day they keep you inside. 
'Cause when you do get out, you're only going to get one more chance. 
And we're not going to see each other for a long, long time. 
What's going to happen now? 
That is up to you. 
You think he heard me? 
I'll let you know. 
[ Captioning Sponsored by CBS ] 
South Beach, are you ready to party? 
! It's going to be off the hook! 
Spring break is here! 
All right, ladies, this... this is for Babes on Break. 
You got to show America what you got. 
All right? 
Ready? 
One... two... three! 
Oh, my god. 
I got a t-shirt. 
Dude... where's the car? 
Dude, where are we? 
Hey! 
You better get up. Tide's coming in. 
Hey, wake up. 
Hey, what...? 
Whoa! My...! Geez! 
Oh, geez! 
Let's get out of here! 
Hate to state the obvious, but her neck's been broken. 
Sunburn says she's a tourist. 
You know what that means. 
Come down here, looking to blow off steam... and they think the rules don't apply. 
Welcome to spring break. 
How'd this happen, Sugar? 
All you wanted was a week of fun and sun. 
Good times, hanging out with your friends. 
Should've been the time of her life, Alexx... instead of the end of it. 
1x21 Spring Break 
Guys who found her, slept out here last night, twenty feet away. 
They didn't see or hear anything. 
Drunken, passed-out kids ; 
I guess that's possible. Hang on a second, guys. 
Hang on. I want a new one, and let's put her in the VIP room, please. 
All right? 
New body bag, copy that. 
Maybe she was dumped. 
Nope. No drag marks. It means she was killed right here. 
This time of year, all the nuts roll downhill to South Florida. 
Speed? Big party. 
How do you figure? 
It's motor oil. 
Only snowbirds would be dumb enough to park way out here. 
They're lucky the tide didn't take their vehicle. 
Okay, let's set a grid ten yards in both directions. See what we get. 
You got it. All right. 
Hey, Blondie. 
You're hot. 
Flash me. Why don't you show me something? 
Come on, flash me. 
Flash me. 
You know you want to. Is this hot enough for you? 
Or you want to see my weapons permit? 
Hey... I didn't mean anything. 
Motel Manager called it in. 
Says there were a hundred kids out here last night, and no one saw anything. 
Was our vic staying here? 
It's hard to say. 
They pack these kids, eight, ten to a room. 
Got to go finish up with the manager. 
He hasn't been down there long. 
It usually takes a while for the body to float. 
Body gasses have to have time to build up. 
Well, it looks like somebody's getting wet. 
Music to my ears. 
Excuse me, ma'am? 
Could we talk to you? If you promise not to call me" ma'am". 
Your friend is totally hot. 
Do you know if he has a girlfriend? 
Uh, not currently. Well, how old is he? 
Cute girls. 
Yeah, they thought you were cute, too. 
Oh, yeah? 
What'd they say? They were wondering if you had a younger brother. 
Funny. 
Nah, I don't think he drowned. 
There's no foam around his nostrils or his mouth. 
Means there's no water in his lungs. 
He's got scratches on his feet. 
His arms are bruised. 
I don't know, it looks like he's been beaten. 
He might've been wasted, too. 
Check out the tag on his trunks, on backwards. 
Something's not right. We should get him down to autopsy. 
You find something? 
Still a little girl, isn't she? 
Take a look at this, Horatio. 
We've got a biter. At least six sets of marks, avulsed. 
Most dramatic type. Bites like this don't just happen. 
So, he's a predator. 
Let's see if had a history. 
I'll swab for saliva and semen. 
See if there's anything for CODIS. Okay, and I will call the Odontologist. 
Hey! 
Buddy! 
You want to get this moving! Hey! 
Ted Zink, Matraca Tequila. 
You're in my party area. 
Your what? 
We're hosting a big event for the Greeks. 
Part of our spring break marketing package : Uh, Lauderdale, Daytona, Miami Beach. 
We take the party wherever the kids are. 
You know, you hook them young, they're yours for life. 
Sir, can you read the yellow tape right there? It says" crime scene." 
Hey, I got permit to be here. 
Oh... you got a permit. 
Yeah, that's right. 
From parks and rec. Well... 
I'm going to let you tell that to the family of the girl... that got murdered here last night. 
Whoa, hold on... 
I'm going to let you tell them... that we can't process this crime scene... because you have a permit for a party. 
You misunderstood me... 
Then I'm going to arrest your cheap, tequila-pushing ass... and have you spend the night in lockup... with all the drunk-and-disorderlies, and you can smell the vomit of the fraternity boys. 
You know what? Maybe I-I... maybe I should just wait until you're finished. 
That's a capital idea, Ted. 
Three months ago. 
Yes, hello. 
Horatio. 
It's Alexx. Hey. 
How bad is it? 
Bad. 
Couldn't recover any semen? 
Oh, I recovered it. 
Sent it on to CODIS. 
Findings are postmortem. The vaginal tears at five, six and seven. 
No resistance or compliance by our victim. 
Was she unconscious? 
I was hoping for that, too. So I swabbed her wounds. 
No blood was circulating at the time of penetration. 
She was already dead. 
Rachel Moon. 
That's her picture. 
The birth date says 1979. 
There's no way she's 24 years old. 
Well, if it's a fake, it's a good one. 
There's no glue lines, no bumps. Lamination thickness is dead-on. 
Whatever happened to just stealing your older sister's I.D.? 
These days, you don't have to. 
Any college kid with a color printer and... a high-rez scanner can rip these things out. 
This is quality work. 
State seal. 
Ultraviolet ink. 
Security layer. Man, this guy's good. 
Got him. 
We traced the license back to a Rachel Moon, 
We faxed her a picture of our victim. 
She I.D.' D her. Some girl in her dorm. 
Tiffany Heitzenrader. 
How old is Tiffany? 
Just turned 19. 
She's homecoming queen. 
Varsity soccer. 
Dean's list. 
All-american girl. 
Yeah, her sister's flying in. 
Her parents are just too broken up. 
CODIS got a hit on the semen from our beach victim. 
You get a donor? Carson Mackie, 28. 
Owns a video company. 
New Jersey address. 
Convicted of statutory rape in' 93. 
He was 19, she was 17. 
State police make contact? 
He's on a business trip. You want to guess where? 
A hotel on Collins. 
The Silver Palm. Steps away from the ocean. Let's go talk to Mr. Mackie. 
All right now, ladies... spring break comes but once a year. 
What are you going to show me? Will you see our faces? 
Oh, believe me, if you take off your top, people won't be looking at your face. 
Come on, come on, 
Show me something. 
I don't know. Carson Mackie? There's no pressure, you know. 
If you want some privacy, we can go in the cabana. 
MDPD. 
We need a few words with you. 
Yeah, I'll be with you in... in a minute. 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, guys, guys. 
Keep rolling, keep shooting. 
Hey, Carson. 
So what is this about? 
So you, uh... you bird-dog girls for babes on break? 
Is that how it works? 
I own the company. I invite girls to be on camera. 
My crew shoots it. May I? 
Well, hell, you're a regular corporate giant. 
Yes, sir, he's a CEO. Do you... recognize this young lady, Tiffany Heitzenrader? 
No. 
Pretty girl... figured you might remember her. Girls like her are a dime a dozen in my world. 
Here's how this one is different. 
Somebody recently broke her neck, and now she's dead. 
That's too bad. 
You seem concerned. 
Here's the other difference. 
We found your semen inside of her. Medical examiner says... physical evidence was postmortem. 
Do you know what that means, Fellini? 
No... 
It means you had sex with a dead girl. After you snapped her neck. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa... I-I didn't... 
I didn't snap her neck. I thought she was drunk. 
I mean, it's spring break, right? 
So you want me to believe... that you're capable of having sex... with a dead young girl? 
That's how it happened, man. 
You know, it makes one wonder... what else you're capable of. 
Just got a hit on AFIS. 
Pool boy is Trey Hanson, 19 years old, from Indianapolis. 
Why was he in the system? 
Prior for possession. Under an ounce. 
Well, you were right. 
Mr. Hanson didn't drown. 
Then what killed him? 
Subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
Had an aneurysm? 
Weak spot in the artery swells up like a balloon. 
Any kind of pressure inside the head... a bump, a sudden jerk, a sneeze, and the balloon goes... 
Don't know if it was born, formed, or caused by trauma. 
It's likely he didn't even know he had it. 
What about the scratching and the bruising? 
Most of it's old. Days and weeks. 
If he was getting beaten up, it was regularly, except for this one. 
It's perimortem. 
Can't tell if it was before or after death, but it may have been what caused the aneurysm to burst. 
Poor guy probably didn't know what hit him. 
Maybe someone else did. 
This the one? 
Yeah, the front desk told Bernstein... that Trey Hanson was registered in room 206. 
Him and some friends. I got it. 
Yo, what took you so long? Your ad said a half hour. 
Officer Delko and Duquesne, Miami-Dade Crime Lab. Mind if we come in? 
Yeah, sure. 
Yeah, come on in. 
Sorry about that. Thought you were the pizza guy. Yeah, no worries. 
We just came here to ask you some questions... about your roommate. 
Trey? 
Oh, he-he's not here, man. 
It's a mighty tidy room. Know where he is? 
No. No. 
I haven't seen him since last night. 
You guys? 
Dude, you can't get a power booster in the middle of the game. Can, too. 
Can not. Can, too. 
Oh, yeah. 
Two for flinching. 
Oh, yeah? 
I like it. 
Thank you. You know, I think... Trey might have hooked up with that blonde girl from I.U. 
I saw them dancing by the pool last night. Know what time? 
I don't know. 
Last night was pretty much a blur, if you know what I mean. 
Maybe y'all's clothes from last night can help clear that up. What? 
Look. 
Your friend is dead. 
Okay, now, what we need are... the clothes you had on the last time you were with him. 
Let's go. 
The bruises on y'all's arms look an awful lot like Trey's. 
Did you guys have a flinch game that got out of hand? 
Is that how he ended up at the bottom of the pool? 
Delko. 
Yeah. 
How high? 
Okay. Thanks. 
Is that tox? 
Trey Hanson's THC levels were 200 nanograms per mil. 
Whoa. That is out of control. 
Did you guys smoke marijuana with Trey last night? 
Nah. No. 
No. 
Then you won't mind if we search the room for narcotics. 
Take a walk, boys. 
Go stand outside with the officer. 
What's taking so long? Why? 
You going somewhere? 
Lake Havasu next week. South Padre the week after that. I got a business to run. 
My videos are going to be a national brand before I'm thirty. 
With all that travel... when was the last time you saw the dentist? 
Let's start with the occlusal surfaces. 
W-what are you talking about? 
This... is your chance. 
Open wide. 
They told us her neck was broken on the phone. 
I'm sorry about your sister. 
I don't understand how that could happen. 
Tiffany rides horses. 
She mucks stalls. 
I-I've seen her get thrown and pop right back up again. 
She's such a strong girl. 
Yeah? 
Was. 
She was so excited for this trip. 
She worked all Christmas just to pay for it. 
Who would do this to her? 
Well... we're working on that. 
But here's what I want you to do. 
This is my cell phone number. 
If you need to talk, you call me, day or night. All right? 
Thank you. 
All right. Hang in there. 
Lieutenant? Yeah? 
When can I take Tiffie home? 
We can't release her to you... until we're finished, but as soon as we can, I'll let you know. 
All right. 
Are you sure about this? 
There aren't enough concordant points... to match Carson Mackie's teeth to your victim's bites. 
But what about these premolars? 
Some similarity in the interproximal surfaces, yes, but that could be any one of a million guys. 
Okay, Jon, this guy stinks. 
May be, Horatio, but the courts only care how the evidence smells. 
... thank you. 
I told you I didn't kill that girl. 
Now, where do I go to sign out? 
I got a business to get back to. 
Your business... just got a whole lot harder to run, so sit down. 
What? 
! 
Abuse of a dead body is a second-degree felony. 
You're about to inherit a jacket for necrophilia. 
Not only that, we're going to let every law enforcement agency... in Florida know about it. 
So, every town you roll into, every time you set up shop, the law's going to be looking over your shoulder, chasing away the babes. 
So why don't you put that in your video? 
Hey... you ought to check this out. 
Okay. 
Tyler here's been working on a new database. Okay. 
I'm still beta-testing, but it's pretty accurate. 
We ran with what you started. 
Scanned every sexual assault / murder... in Florida in the last three years. 
Then we cross-referenced, kept only the ones that occurred on the beach. 
Then we eliminated every one but... the biters and the broken necks. 
Left us with three cases. 
Daytona, Panama City, Key West, and now Miami. 
All spring break destinations... where the girls are most vulnerable. 
This guy's calculating. 
Yes, he is, and he has plenty of opportunity... because we've got two weeks left to go. 
Hang on a second. Yeah. 
Okay. That was beach patrol. 
We have another victim. 
They notify M.E.? That would be premature. 
This one's still alive. 
Is this her over here? Yeah. 
Her name's Amy? 
Amy? 
I'm Horatio Caine. 
I'm with the Crime Lab. 
You doing all right? 
No. 
What happened? 
I was with all my friends at this tequila party up by the hotel. 
And I guess I did too many shots,'cause I felt like I was going to heave, so I walked on the beach, and I must've passed out. 
What happened after that? 
I thought I was dreaming of sharks. 
I opened my eyes, and this guy is biting me. 
So I yelled my damn head off, and I kicked him as hard as I could, and I must've connected, because he ran away. 
Did you get a look at him? 
No, it was totally dark out there. 
Plus, I was pretty drunk. 
Are those from him? 
Does this go in some kind of record, or something? 
No. 
None that your parents will ever see. 
Those are from body shots. 
Did you know these guys? 
The whole idea of spring break is... to meet new people. 
Do you think one of those guys was my attacker? 
I don't know. 
Do you have any other bite marks? 
He was so freaky. 
Amy, listen to me. 
I know this is difficult. 
But you see, teeth marks are like a fingerprint, and it could really help me go after this guy. 
You understand? 
Okay. You can cover those. 
It wasn't supposed to be like this. 
I know. 
I know. 
You're safe now, Amy. You're safe, now. 
You're safe. 
Four on a bong? 
DNA'll be able to answer that. 
Maybe trace can tell us what these white flecks are. 
I'll call Bernstein and tell him to let the boys back in. 
Madraca tequila! 
Right here! 
All you can swallow! 
Madraca, the only tequila! 
How's Amy? 
She's shaken up. She's shaken up. 
A SART nurse just took her to the ER. 
Did you get anything off her bites? No. 
You know how that is. 
You know how bruises are. 
Blood rushes to the bites, swallows them, diffuses them ; 
We're back to square one. 
Well, maybe not. 
Check this out. 
It's a memory stick. 
Plugs into one of those digital camcorders. 
See all these yahoos shooting video all day? 
Our attacker could be on that, couldn't he? 
Let's take a look at it. Nice going. 
Hey, DNA just paged me. 
Found all four guys on the mouthpiece of that bong. 
I'm not surprised ; 
it seemed like they were lying. 
What about the white specks in the bong chamber? 
High pleghm content and traces of HCl. 
Stomach acid. 
Who threw up? 
Well, the vomit matches our dead body, Trey. 
Probably a symptom of his aneurysm. Or, the aneurysm is the result of a trauma. 
You up for a dog and pony show? 
Absolutely. 
Okay, this is what we know : 
Y'all were smoking out of the bong, your friend Trey got very stoned, he vomited, and then he died. 
So the question is, guys, did somebody force him to smoke? 
We didn't force him to do anything. 
So, how do explain the THC levels? 
Bong olympics. Say again? 
Uh, it's a game. 
Oh, you mean like punching each other? You see how much weed you can smoke? 
No, not how much, how long. 
All right, the first one to exhale... buys a round tonight. 
You're up, man. 
Come on, dude! 
Come on, dude! 
Trey got sick, so... we went swimming to clear his head, make him feel better. 
So, you admit you went with him to the pool. 
Actually, we... we took a shortcut. 
Okay, so the four of you left the hotel room. 
You walked upstairs to the roof, and then you jumped off the roof. 
Yeah. 
Hundreds of people saw us, just ask anyone. 
Well, that's convenient. 
Okay. Sit tight. 
Memory stick you guys found was pretty dinged up. 
I had to run a few recovery utilities just to get this. 
Come on, Amy, go for it. 
There's Amy, the girl that was attacked last night. 
This looks like something Carson Mackie shot, or one of his cameramen. 
I didn't do anything. 
Totally showed your thong. 
Shut up! You are so dead! 
Wait a second. 
What was that? 
Shut up! You are so dead! 
Stop-and-start. 
Just a flicker between takes. 
Can we slow that down? 
Yeah. 
That's Tiffany. 
Can we see more of her? 
There should be a residual charge stored on the capacitor. 
We could get lucky. 
I'm not going to show you that, okay? 
I'm a good girl. 
This had to be recorded last week. 
That's Carson's voice. 
He's bird-dogging somebody else without realizing it. 
Look at her eye-line. You said you'd do it. 
I'm holding you to it. 
All right, but I'm only doing this for a free shirt. 
She never looks at the camera. 
And that's because this is... not Carson's crew, it's our killer. 
Here you go. 
There's your shirt. 
And we're looking right... through his eyes. Say good-bye. 
Good-bye. 
I'm sorry, mom and dad. 
Okay, so they said the four of them walked across the roof, which got me thinking : 
Motel roofs are tar and gravel. 
He's got the scratches to prove it. On the tops of his feet. 
And there is only one way that happened. 
He was dragged. 
Up the stairs and onto the roof. 
His swimming trunks were on backwards... and it wasn't because he was stoned. 
It was a re-dress. 
He died in his room. 
He died in their room. 
These are your friend's autopsy pictures. 
You guys crazy, showing us this? 
Well, we figured if... you guys weren't going to tell us the truth, we'd bring in someone who would. 
Is this some kind of sick joke? No, not at all. 
Trey's body tells us that he was dead before he hit the water. 
So, we're thinking... maybe your motel room. 
Eventually, he's going to tell us the truth. 
Unless one of you wants to tell us first. 
He just collapsed. 
We didn't know what to do. 
Shut up, Matt! 
They figured it out! 
He was on my team. 
We were down two minutes. 
I didn't want to lose. What do you mean, your team? 
It's another competition. 
He couldn't hold his stuff. 
So, I... I helped him. 
Holding his breath like that is what caused the aneurysm. 
Oh, my god! 
He's dead! 
Don't freak out! 
Don't freak out! 
What do we do, man? ! 
I got a plan. 
All right, guys? I got a plan. 
Drag him over. 
Make it look real. 
Are y'all ready? 
Let's go. 
No one noticed that Trey didn't came back up. 
So you passed him off for alive when he was already dead. 
Matt, why didn't you call 911? 
I didn't want to get in trouble. 
What's going to happen to Matt? 
The same thing that's going to happen to the two of you. 
What? 
W-we didn't do anything. 
You're both accomplices to a homicide. 
Involuntary manslaughter, negligent homicide. 
That's for the state's attorney to decide. 
The sad thing is that you could've called 911, if you wouldn't have been so stoned. 
You might've saved a friend's life... instead of making a wreck of your own. 
There's your shirt. 
Say good-bye. 
Good-bye. 
I'm sorry, mom and dad. 
I'm sorry, mom and dad. 
Lieutenant? 
Come here a second. 
Tell me if this guy just cleaned his lens. 
Or... he's giving us the finger. 
Yeah, but you know what they say : You point a finger, there's three pointing back at you. 
Let's run this through video enhancement... and bring up the ridge detail, okay? 
Bet you there are a thousand other guys out there with cameras. 
That may be true. 
But you're the only one with parking tickets... in the same location and date as each of our victims, Mr. Miller. 
Coincidence. 
Coincidence, maybe. 
But it is going to be hard for you to explain... away your teeth marks on Tiffany Heitzenrader. 
Never met her. 
You just keep telling yourself that, my friend. 
Hey. Heard you're looking for me. 
Yeah. 
These bite marks we got from Tiffany, they don't match our suspect, Kip Miller, 
Is there any way to get better definition? Maybe excise the wound track? 
Markings on dead flesh degrade, you know that. 
They're probably in worse shape now... than they were at her autopsy. 
Dead flesh, but what about living, Alexx? What about living? 
Anything I could do to help. 
I swear, I already told you everything I remember, okay? 
Amy? You said my bite marks couldn't help. 
What's changed all of a sudden? 
Actually, it's not all of a sudden. 
The blood from the bruising... is absorbed back into the skin over time. 
Giving us a greater definition of the bite mark. 
" Teeth are like fingerprints". 
I know. 
I can't. 
I'm sorry. 
I just want to go back home... and pretend none of this ever happened to me. 
And that's understandable. 
You think I'm awful. 
No, I don't. 
I think you're a human being and that's okay. 
You don't look like it's okay. 
Here's the problem. 
You're the only one who stands between this guy... and his next victim and you're leaving. 
Do you see why that's a problem? 
Why'd you have to be so nice to me out on the beach last night? 
Okay. 
Take those bags out of there, please. 
Ready? 
All right. 
Horatio. 
" Inconclusive"? 
Afraid so. 
You got more points of concordance than before, but the bottom line is, it's Carson Mackie all over again. 
No, wait a second. 
Hold on a second. This is dissonance. 
Does he wear crowns? 
Doesn't present that way. 
And temps would've come off when we took his impressions. 
Unless he's been doing a little in-home dentistry. 
Let's find out. 
Thank you. 
Stand up, Kip. 
Stand up. 
Oh, you're going to have to let me go, aren't you? 
Not yet. 
Smile for me. 
What? 
Smile. Aah. 
You have an overbite. 
You wear crowns? 
No. 
No? 
See, I think you do. 
I think that you wear temporary crowns... on your upper right cuspid and bicuspid. 
I don't know what you're talking about. 
No? 
Do you take them out before each attack? 
Did you put them back with dental cement... when the police got on to you? 
Okay. 
Smile for me again. 
Let me give you a little help. 
Oops. 
Now it matches. 
You're under arrest for the sexual assault of Amy Gorman. 
Get him out of here. 
Gladly. 
Get up! 
Take care. 
Good crowns. 
Precision attachments. 
Explains why we didn't see them. 
I wish we could've gotten him on Tiffany... and those other murders. 
The important thing right now is that he's behind bars. 
Fools like him, he's going to be giving it away. 
He'll forget about us, about forensics, and the most important thing about Miami. 
Which is? 
We never close. 
Bikini.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 
Harry. 
Harry. 
Harry, open the door. 
Uncle Vernon, I need you to sign this form. 
What is it? 
Nothing. 
School stuff. 
Later perhaps, if you behave. 
I will if she does. 
- Oh, you're still here, are you? 
- Yes. 
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way. 
Damn good of my brother to keep you. 
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep, Vernon. 
Is that my little neffy-pooh? Give us a kiss. Come on. 
Up, up. 
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs. 
Finish that off for Mommy. 
Good boy, Rippy-pooh. 
- Can I tempt you, Marge? 
- Just a small one. 
Excellent nosh, Petunia. 
A bit more. 
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs. 
Just a bit more. 
You wanna try a little drop of brandy? 
What are you smirking at? 
Where did you send the boy, Vernon? 
St. Brutus'. 
It's a fine institution for hopeless cases. 
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy? 
Oh, yeah. 
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times. 
Excellent. 
I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it. 
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out, Vernon. 
It's all to do with blood. 
Bad blood will out. 
What is it the boy's father did, Petunia? Nothing. 
He didn't work. He was unemployed. 
- And a drunk too, no doubt? 
- That's a lie. 
- What did you say? 
- My dad wasn't a drunk. 
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia. 
I have a very firm grip. 
I think it's time you went to bed. 
Quiet, Vernon. 
You, clean it up. 
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father. It's all to do with the mother. 
You see it all the time with dogs. 
If there's something wrong with the bitch, then there's something wrong with the pup. 
Shut up! 
Shut up! 
Let me tell you... 
Vernon! 
Vernon, do something! 
Stop! 
I've got you, Marge. 
- Get off. 
- Don't you dare! - Sorry. 
Oh, Vernon. 
Oh, God. 
You bring her back! 
You bring her back now. 
- You put her right! 
- No. She deserved what she got. 
- Just keep away from me. 
- You're not allowed to do magic outside school. - Yeah? 
- They won't let you back now. 
You've nowhere to go. 
I don't care. 
Anywhere is better than here. 
" Welcome to the Knight Bus emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. 
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor for this evening." 
What you doing down there? - I fell over. 
- What you fall over for? 
- I didn't do it on purpose. 
- Well, come on, then. 
Let's not wait for the grass to grow. 
- What you looking at? 
- Nothing. 
Well, come on, then. In. 
No, no, no. 
I'll get this. 
Come on. Move on, move on. 
- Take her away, Ern. 
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie. 
It's going to be a bumpy ride. 
- What did you say your name was again? 
- For whereabouts are you headed? 
- For Leaky Cauldron. 
That's in London. 
Do you hear that, Ern? 
" The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London." 
The Leaky Cauldron. 
If you have pea soup make sure you eat it before it eats you. 
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us? 
- Muggles? 
They don't see nothing, do they? 
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel. 
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock! 
Ten, nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, three and a half two, one and three quarters. 
Yes! 
Who is that? 
That man. 
Who is that? Who is...? 
That is Sirius Black, that is. 
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black. 
He's a murderer. 
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it. 
- How did he escape? 
- Well, that's the question, isn't it? 
He's the first one that done it. 
He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who. 
I reckon you've heard of him. 
Yeah. 
Him I've heard of. 
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock. 
They're getting closer, Ernie. 
Ernie, they're right on top of us! 
Mind your head. 
Hey, guys? Guys? Why the long faces? 
Nearly there. Nearly there. 
- The Leaky Cauldron. 
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley. 
Mr. Potter, at last. 
- Take it away, Ern. 
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie! 
Room 11. 
Hedwig. 
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter. 
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself. 
As the Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter that earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack. 
The Accidental Magic Reversal Department was dispatched immediately. 
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified. 
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever. 
So that's that and no harm done. 
Pea soup? 
No, thank you. 
- Minister? 
- Yes? 
- I don't understand. 
- Understand? 
I broke the law. 
Underage wizards aren't allowed to use magic at home. 
The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts. 
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things was very, very irresponsible. 
-" The state of things," sir? 
- We have a killer on the loose. 
Sirius Black, you mean? 
But what's he got to do with me? 
Nothing, of course. 
You're safe. And that's what matters. 
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts. 
These are your new schoolbooks. 
I took the liberty of having them brought here for you. 
Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't wander. Now Tom will show you to your room. 
Hedwig. 
Oh, by the way, Harry. 
Housekeeping. 
I'll come back later. 
I'm warning you, Hermione. Keep that bloody beast of yours away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy. 
It's a cat, Ronald. 
- It's in his nature. - A cat? 
Is that what they told you? 
- Looks more like a pig with hair if you ask me. 
It's all right, Crookshanks, you just ignore the mean little boy. 
Harry. 
Harry. 
- Egypt. 
What's it like? 
- Brilliant. 
Loads of old stuff like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself. 
- You know the Egyptians used to worship cats 
- Along with the dung beetle. 
- Not flashing that clipping about again, are you, Ron? 
- I haven't shown anyone. 
No, not a soul. 
Not unless you count Tom. 
- The night maid. 
- The cook. 
- The bloke that came to fix the toilet. 
- Harry. 
- Good to see you, dear. 
- Good to see you too. 
- Now, I think, you have everything you'll need? - Yeah. 
- Yes? 
All of your books? 
- And all of your clothes? 
- Everything is there. 
- Good boy. 
- Thank you. - Harry Potter. 
- Mr. Weasley. 
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word? 
- Hermione. - Good morning, Mr. Weasley. 
- Looking forward to a new term? 
- Yeah. 
Harry, there are some within the Ministry who would strongly discourage me from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you. 
But I think that you need to know the facts. 
You are in danger. 
Grave danger. 
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir? 
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry? 
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban. 
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped... 
- Voldemort. 
- Don't say his name. 
Sorry. 
When you stopped You-Know-Who Black lost everything. 
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant. 
And in his mind you are the only thing that stands in the way of You-Know-Who returning to power. 
And that is why he has escaped from Azkaban. 
To find you. 
And kill me. 
Harry, I want you to swear to me that whatever you might hear you won't go looking for Black. 
Mr. Weasley why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me? 
Ron, Ron! 
Don't lose him! 
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just... - I lost control. 
- Brilliant. 
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. 
Harry was lucky not to be expelled. 
I think I was lucky not to be arrested actually. 
I still think it was brilliant. 
Come on. Everywhere else is full. 
Who do you think that is? 
- Professor R.J. Lupin. 
- Do you know everything? 
How is it she knows everything? 
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald. 
- Do you think he's really asleep? 
- Seems to be. 
I gotta tell you something. 
Let me get this straight. 
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you? 
- Yeah. 
But they'll catch Black, won't they? 
- I mean, everyone's looking for him. 
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a murderous, raving lunatic. 
Why are we stopping? 
We can't be there yet. 
What's going on? 
I don't know. 
Maybe we've broken down. 
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot. 
There's something moving out there. 
I think someone's coming aboard. 
Bloody hell! 
What's happening? 
Harry. 
Harry, are you all right? 
Thank you. 
Here, eat this. 
It's all right. It's chocolate. 
What was that thing that came? 
It was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now. 
It was searching the train for Sirius Black. 
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver. 
Eat. You'll feel better. 
What happened to me? 
Well, you sort of went rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something. 
And did either of you two you know pass out? 
- No. 
I felt weird, though. 
Like I'd never be cheerful again. 
But someone was screaming. 
A woman. 
No one was screaming, Harry. 
Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts. 
Now, I'd like to say a few words before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast. 
First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin who's kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. 
Good luck, professor. 
Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry. 
Potter. 
Is it true you fainted? 
- I mean, you actually fainted? 
- Shove off, Malfoy. 
- How did he find out? 
- Just forget it. 
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher for many years has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. 
Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be taken by none other than our own Rubeus Hagrid. 
Finally, on a more disquieting note at the request of the Ministry of Magic Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban until such a time as Sirius Black is captured. 
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds. 
Now whilst I've been assured that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities a word of caution. 
Dementors are vicious creatures. 
They'll not distinguish between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way. 
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you. 
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. 
But you know, happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light. 
Fortuna Major. 
She just won't let me in. 
- Fortuna Major. - No, no. 
Wait, wait. 
Watch this. 
- Amazing. 
Just with my voice. 
- Fortuna Major. 
- Yes, all right. 
Go in. - Thank you. 
Still doing that after three years. 
- She can't even sing. 
That's a monkey. 
- What is that? 
- You call that a monkey? 
Do not give him one again. 
Hey, Neville, try an elephant. 
- Ron, catch. - I will. 
- Oh, don't try one of them. 
Welcome, my children. 
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination. 
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight. 
I am Professor Trelawney. 
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future. 
This term, we'll be focussing on Tasseomancy, which is the art of reading tea leaves. 
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you. 
What do you see? The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read. 
But first, you must broaden your minds. 
- First, you must look beyond. - What a load of rubbish. 
- Where did you come from? 
- I've been here all this time. 
Is your grandmother quite well? 
I think so. 
I wouldn't be so sure of that. 
Give me the cup. 
Pity. 
Broaden your minds. 
Your aura is pulsing, dear. 
Are you in the beyond? 
- I think you are. 
- Sure. 
Look at the cup. Tell me what you see. 
Yeah. 
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross. That's trials and suffering. 
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness. 
So you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it. 
Give me the cup. 
My dear you have the Grim. 
What's the Grin? 
Not the Grin, you idiot. 
" Taking form of a giant spectral dog. 
It's among the darkest omens in our world. 
It's an omen of death." 
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black, do ya? 
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me, Divination's a very woolly discipline. 
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject. 
Exactly how many classes are you taking this term? 
A fair few. 
That's not possible. 
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination. 
You have to be in two classes at once. 
Don't be silly, Ronald. How could anyone be in two classes at once? 
" Broaden your minds. 
Use your Inner Eye to see the future." 
That's it. 
Come on, now. Come closer. 
Less talking, if you don't mind. 
I got a real treat for you today. 
A great lesson. 
So follow me. 
Right, you lot. Less chattering. Form a group over there. 
And open your books to page 49. 
Exactly how do we do that? 
Just stroke the spine, of course. 
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom. 
- I think they're funny. 
- Oh, yeah. 
Really witty. 
God, this place has gone to the dogs. 
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes. 
Shut up, Malfoy. 
Dementor! Dementor! 
- Just ignore him. - You're supposed to stroke it. 
Isn't he beautiful? 
Say hello to Buckbeak. 
Hagrid, exactly what is that? 
That, Ron, is a hippogriff. 
First thing you wanna know about hippogriff is that they're very proud creatures. 
Very easily offended. 
You do not want to insult a hippogriff. 
It may just be the last thing you ever do. 
Now, who'd like to come and say hello? 
Well done, Harry. 
Come on now. 
Now you have to let him make the first move. So step up. 
Give him a nice bow. It's only polite. Then you wait and see if he bows back. 
If he does, you can go and touch him. 
If not... 
Well, we'll get to that later. 
Just make your bow. 
Nice and low. 
Back off, Harry. Back off. 
Keep still. 
Keep still. 
Well done, Harry. 
I think you can go and pat him now. 
Go on. Don't be shy. 
Nice and slow, now. 
Not so fast, Harry. 
Slow down, Harry. 
Now let him come to you. 
Yes! 
Well done! 
Well done, Harry, well done! 
- I think he may let you ride him now. 
- What? 
- Come on. - Hey, hey, hey! 
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint. 
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that. 
Well done, Harry, and well done, Buckbeak. 
Oh, please. 
- How am I doing me first day? 
- Brilliant, professor. 
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute! 
Whoa! Buckbeak! 
Away, you silly creature... 
- It's killed mw! 
- Calm down. It's just a scratch! 
Hagrid! 
- He has to be taken to the hospital. 
- I'm the teacher. 
- You're gonna regret this. 
- Class dismissed! 
You and your bloody chicken! 
Does it hurt terribly, Draco? 
It comes and it goes. 
Still, I consider myself lucky. 
According to Madam Pomfrey, another minute or two and I could've lost my arm. 
- I couldn't possibly do any homework for weeks. 
- Listen to the idiot. 
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he? 
- But at least Hagrid didn't get fired. 
Yeah, but I heard Draco's father's furious. 
We haven't heard the end of this. 
- He's been sighted! - Who? 
Sirius Black! 
Dufftown? 
That's not far from here. 
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you? 
- With dementors at every entrance? 
- Dementors? 
He's already slipped past them once, hasn't he? 
Who's to say he won't do it again? 
That's right. 
Black could be anywhere. 
It's like trying to catch smoke. 
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands. 
Intriguing, isn't it? 
Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what is inside? 
- That's a boggart, that is. 
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like? 
- No one knows. 
- When did she get here? 
Boggarts are shape-shifters. 
They take the shape of whatever a particular person fears the most. 
- That's what makes them so... 
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes... 
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart. 
Let's practice it now. 
Without wands, please. 
After me. Riddikulus! 
- Very good. 
A little louder and very clear. 
Listen : 
- This class is ridiculous. 
- Very good. 
Well, so much for the easy part. 
You see, the incantation alone is not enough. 
What really finishes a boggart is laughter. 
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. 
Neville, would you join me, please? 
Come on, don't be shy. 
Neville, what frightens you most of all? Professor Snape. 
- Sorry? 
- Professor Snape. 
Yes, frightens all. 
And, I believe you live with your grandmother. 
Yes, but I don't want that boggart to turn into her, either. 
No it won't. I want you to picture her clothes. 
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind. 
- She carries a red handbag... 
- We don't need to hear. 
As long as you see it, we'll see it. 
Now, when I open that wardrobe here's what I want you to do. 
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes. 
Can you do that? 
Yes. 
Wand at the ready. 
One, two, three. 
Think, Neville, think. 
Riddikulus! 
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful! 
Incredible! 
Okay to the back, Neville. 
Everyone, form a line... 
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most and turn it into something funny. 
Next! 
Ron! 
Concentrate. 
Wand at the ready, Ron. 
Marvelous! 
Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! 
Show us what you see. 
Steady. 
Riddikulus! 
And next! Step up, step up! 
Riddikulus! 
Sorry about that. 
That's enough for today. 
You'd all have to collect your books from the back of the class. 
That's the end of the lesson. 
Sorry! 
Now, Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege. 
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school in any way that privilege shall not be extended again. 
No permission form signed, no visiting the village. 
That's the rule, Potter. 
All those with permission, follow me. Those without, stay put. 
But professor, I thought if you signed it, then I could... I can't. 
Only a parent or a guardian can sign. 
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate. 
I'm sorry, Potter. 
That's my final word. 
Forget about it, guys. 
See you later. 
Professor, can I ask you something? 
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes? 
I would've thought it'd be obvious. I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort. 
I did think of Voldemort at first. 
But then I remembered that night on the train and the dementor. 
- And I'm very impressed. 
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself. 
This is very wise. 
Before I fainted I heard something. 
A woman screaming. 
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories. 
Our pain becomes their power. 
I think it was my mother the night she was murdered. 
You know, the very first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately. 
Not by your scar, by your eyes. 
They're your mother, Lily's. 
Yes. Oh, yes. 
I knew her. 
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. 
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch she was also an uncommonly kind woman. 
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others... even, and perhaps most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves. 
And your father, James, on the other hand he... 
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble. 
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you. 
You're more like them than you know, Harry. 
In time, you'll come to see just how much. 
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop. 
We never did get a chance to go to the Shrieking Shack though. 
- You heard that it's the most isolated building in Britain. 
What's going on? 
Probably Neville forgot the password again. - Hey. 
Let me through, please. 
Excuse me! 
Get back, all of you. 
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been fully searched. 
The Fat Lady! She's gone! 
Serves her right. 
She was a terrible singer. 
It's not funny, Ron. 
Keep calm, everyone. 
Break into fours. 
- The headmaster's here. 
You heard. Move! 
Mr. Filch? 
Round up the ghosts. 
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady. 
There's no need for ghosts, professor. 
The Fat Lady's there. 
Dear lady, who did this to you? 
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name. 
It's him, headmaster. 
The one they all talk about. 
He's here, somewhere in the castle! 
Sirius Black! 
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch. 
The rest of you, to the Great Hall. 
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery, sir. 
But he's not been there. 
- Thank you. 
- Very good. 
- I've done the dungeons, Headmaster. 
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle. 
I didn't really expect him to linger. 
Remarkable feat, don't you think? 
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own... 
Any theories on how he might've managed it? 
Each as unlikely as the next. 
You may recall prior to the start of term I'd expressed concerns about your appointment of Professor... 
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black to enter it. 
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe and I'm more than willing to send the students back to their houses. 
What about Potter? Should he be warned? Perhaps. 
But for now, let him sleep. 
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own. 
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud. 
Turn to page 394. 
Excuse me, sir. 
Where's Professor Lupin? 
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? 
Suffice it to say that your professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time. 
Turn to page 394. 
" Werewolves"? 
But sir, we've just begun learning about red caps and hinkypunks. 
- We're not meant to start nocturnal beasts for weeks. - Quiet. 
When did she come in? 
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a werewolf? 
No one? 
- How disappointing. 
- Please, sir. An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. 
A werewolf has no choice. 
With each full moon when he transforms he no longer remembers who he is. 
He'd kill his best friend if he cross his path. 
Furthermore, The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind. 
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. 
That's the second time you've spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. 
Are you incapable of restraining yourself or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all? 
- He's got a point, you know. 
- Five points from Gryffindor. 
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with particular emphasis on recognizing it. 
- Sir, It's Quidditch tomorrow. 
Then I suggest you take extra care, Mr. Potter. 
Loss of limb will not excuse you. 
Page 394. 
The term" werewolf" is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word" wer" which means" man," and" wolf." Werewolf, man-wolf. 
They include being given the power of shape-shifting being bitten by a werewolf... 
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he? 
- Peaky? What do you expect? 
He fell over 100 feet. 
Let's walk you off the Astronomy tower, - and see what you look like. 
Probably a right sight better than he normally does. 
- How are you feeling? 
- Oh, brilliant. 
You gave us a right good scare there, mate. 
- What happened? 
- Well, you fell off your broom. 
Really? 
I meant the match. Who won? 
No one blames you, Harry. 
The Dementors aren't supposed to come inside the grounds. 
Dumbledore's furious. 
After he saved you, he sent them straight off. 
There's something else you should know too, Harry. 
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and... 
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick. 
Is there no chance of fixing it? 
No. 
Professor, why do the Dementors affect me so? 
- I mean, more than everyone else? 
The Dementors are amongst the foulest creatures to walk this earth. 
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences. 
You are not weak, Harry. 
The Dementors affect you most of all because there are true horrors in your past. 
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. 
You have nothing to be ashamed of. 
- I'm scared, professor. 
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't. 
I need to know how to fight them. 
You could teach me. 
You made that Dementor on the train go away. 
There was only one that night. 
- But you made it go away. 
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry. 
But as the dementors seem to have developed a particular interest in you perhaps I should teach you. 
But after the holidays. 
For now, I need to rest. 
- Guys, let me go. 
- Clever, Harry. 
- But not clever enough. 
- Besides, We've got a better way. - Guys, come on, I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade. 
- We know. 
- Don't worry. 
- We'll get you there. 
- We'll show you a quicker way. 
- If you pipe down. 
- Oh, Bless him. - Let me go! Come on, guys. 
- Now, Harry. - Come and join the big boys. 
What are you doing? 
- What's this rubbish? 
-" What's this rubbish?" he says. 
- That there's the secret to our success. 
- It's a wrench giving it to you, believe me. 
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours. 
George, if you will. 
" Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present the Marauder's Map." 
We owe them so much. 
Hang on. This is Hogwarts. 
- No. Is that really...? 
- Dumbledore. 
- In his study. 
- Pacing. 
Does that a lot. 
- So, you mean, this map shows... - Everyone. 
- Where they are. 
- What they're doing. - Every minute. - Of every day. 
Where did you get it? 
- Nicked it from Filch's office, of course. 
- Now listen. 
There are 7 secret passageways... out of the castle. 
- We'd recommend this one. 
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway. - It'll lead you stright to Honeyduke seller. 
But you best hurry. 
Filch is heading this way. 
And Harry, don't forget. 
When you're done, just give it a tap and say : 
" Mischief managed." Otherwise, anyone can read it. 
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. 
Did I mention that? 
Twice. 
Do you want to move a bit closer? 
To the Shrieking Shack? 
Actually, I'm fine here. 
Well, well. Look who's here. 
You two shopping for your new dream home? 
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee? 
Don't your family sleep in one room? 
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy. 
- Not very friendly. 
Boys, I think it's time we teach Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors. 
- Hope you don't mean yourself. 
- How dare you talk to me! 
You filthy little mudblood! 
Who is that? 
- Don't stand there! Do something! 
- What? 
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis? 
Get out of the way! 
Malfoy! 
Wait! 
Harry! 
Bloody hell, Harry. 
That was not funny. 
Never told me about any Marauder's Map. 
But Harry isn't going to keep it. 
He's going to turn it over to Professor McGonagall. - Aren't you? 
- Oh sure. 
Along with his Invisibility Cloak. 
Madam Rosmerta. 
- That's not true! 
- Professor McGonagall! 
- Sorry about that. Rosmerta, my dear. 
I hope business is good. 
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors into my pub every other night! 
- We have... - We have a killer on the loose. 
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade! 
And what would bring him here? 
- Harry Potter. 
- Harry Potter? 
Come. 
Harry! 
- No underage wizards allowed in today! 
- Shut the damn door! 
- So rude. 
Nobody's going to come to a pub where they're gonna get scared out of their wits. 
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place I can assure you. 
Now, tell me what this is all about. 
Well now, years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death... 
They went into hiding. 
Few knew where they were. 
One who did was Sirius Black. 
And he told You-Know-Who. 
Not only did Black lead You-Know-Who to the Potters that night but he also killed one of their friends, Peter Pettigrew! 
- Peter Pettigrew? 
- Little lump of a boy. 
- Always trailing after Sirius Black. - I remember him. 
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight. 
- Well, Peter Pettigrew tried to warn the Potters and might have managed to, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black. 
Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew. 
He destroyed him! 
That's all that was left. A finger. 
Yes. 
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters but he's the reason they're dead. 
- And now he wants to finish what he started. - I don't believe it. 
- That's not the worst of it. 
- What could be worse? - This : 
Sirius Black was and remains to this day Harry Potter's godfather! 
Ron, look! 
Excuse me, excuse me. 
Harry, what happened? 
He was their friend and he betrayed them. 
He was their friend! 
I hope he finds me. 
Because when he does, I'm gonna be ready! 
When he does, I'm gonna kill him! 
Harry. 
There you are. You came. 
Now, are you sure about this, Harry? 
You know, this is very advanced magic well beyond the Ordinary Wizarding Level. 
I'm sure. 
Well, everything's prepared. 
Now the spell I'm going to try to teach you is called the Patronus Charm. 
Did you ever hear of it? No? 
Well... 
A Patronus is a kind of positive force, and for the wizard who can conjure one it works something like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him. 
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory. 
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory. 
Can you do this? 
Very well. 
Close your eyes. 
Concentrate. 
Explore your past. 
Do you have a memory? 
Allow it to fill you up. 
Lose yourself within it. 
Then speak the incantation, Expecto Patronum. 
Shall we? Wand at the ready. 
Here we go. Come on. 
Sit up. 
Deep breaths. 
It's all right. 
I didn't expect you to do it the first time. 
That would have been remarkable. 
Here, eat this. You'll feel better. 
- That's one nasty dementor. - Oh, no, no, no. 
That was a boggart, Harry. A boggart. 
The real thing would be worse. Much, much worse. 
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking? 
- Which memory did you choose? 
- The first time I rode a broom. 
That's not good enough. Not nearly good enough. 
There's another. 
It's not happy, exactly. 
Well, it is. 
It's the happiest I've ever felt but it's complicated. 
- Is it strong? 
Then let's give it a try. 
You feel ready? 
Just do it. 
Well done, Harry. 
Well done! 
- I think I've had enough for today. - Yes. 
Here. 
Eat this, it helps. It really helps. 
And just so you know, Harry I think you'd have given your father a run for his money. 
I was thinking of him. 
And Mum. 
Seeing their faces. 
They were talking to me. 
Just talking. 
That's the memory I chose. 
I don't even know if it's real. 
But it's the best I have. 
- Beautiful day. 
- Gorgeous. 
Unless of course you've been ripped to pieces! 
Ripped to pieces? 
What are you talking about? 
- Ronald has lost his rat. 
- I haven't lost anything! 
- Your cat killed him! 
- Rubbish. 
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about. 
And Scabbers is gone. 
Well, maybe you should learn to take better care of your pets! 
- Your cat killed him! - Did not. - Did. 
- Didn't. 
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing? 
Well, first off, the committee members took turns talking about why we were there. 
And then I got up and did my piece. Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers. 
And then Lucius Malfoy got up. Well, you can imagine. 
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you. 
And then? 
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius. 
- They're not sacking you! 
- No, I'm not sacked. 
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death! 
They want me to tap-dance. 
- I don't wanna tap-dance! 
- You tell those spiders, Ron. 
Right, yeah. 
- Little lump of a boy. - Always trailing after Sirius Black. 
- Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him! 
- Put that light out! 
- Sorry. 
- Watch it there, boy. 
- We're trying to sleep here! 
Potter. 
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night? 
I was sleepwalking. 
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. 
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle. 
My dad didn't strut. 
Now if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand. 
Turn out your pockets. 
Turn out your pockets! 
What's this? 
- Spare bit of parchment. 
- Really? Open it. 
Reveal your secrets. 
Read it. 
" Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..." 
Go on. 
" And request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business." 
- Why you insolent little... 
- Professor! 
Well, well. Lupin. 
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we? 
Harry, you all right? 
That remains to be seen. 
I have just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from Mr. Potter. 
Take a look, Lupin. Supposed to be your area of expertise. 
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic. 
- I seriously doubt it, Severus. It looks to me as though it's merely a parchment designed to insult anyone who tries to read it. 
I suspect it's a Zonko product. 
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess. 
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise. 
Harry, would you come with me, please? 
Professor, good night. 
Are you deaf? 
Put that light out! 
Come in. 
Now I haven't the faintest idea harry how this map came to be in your possession but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in. 
It did never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black is a map to you? 
- No. - No, sir. 
You know, Your father never set much store by the rules either. 
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours. 
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering around the castle unprotected with a killer on the loose seems to me a pretty poor way to repay them! 
Now, I will not cover up for you again, Harry. - Do you hear me? 
- Yes, sir. 
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there. 
And don't take any detours. 
If you do, I shall know. 
Professor, just so you know, I don't think that map always works. 
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle. 
Someone I know to be dead. 
Oh, really? And who might that be? 
Peter Pettigrew. 
That's not possible. 
It's just what I saw. 
Good night, professor. 
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye. 
Only then can you see. 
Try again. 
Now, what do we have here? 
Do you mind me trying? 
The Grim, possibly. 
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination. 
You may be young in years, but the heart that beats beneath your bosom is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave. 
Have I said something? 
She's gone mental, Hermione has. 
I mean, not that she wasn't always mental but now it's out in the open for everyone to see. 
Hang on. 
- We better take this back. 
- I'm not going back. 
- Fine. See you later. 
Harry Potter... 
- Professor Trelawney... 
- He will return tonight. 
Sorry? 
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder shall break free. 
Innocent blood shall be spilt and servant and master shall be reunited once more. 
I'm so sorry, dear boy. Did you say something? 
No. 
Nothing. 
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. 
- It just got worse. - What did I tell you? 
- Look who's here. 
- Come to see the show? 
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach! 
Hermione, no! 
He's not worth it. 
Malfoy, are you okay? 
- Let's go. 
- That felt good. 
- Not good, brilliant. 
Look at him. 
Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them. 
Why don't we just set him free? 
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble. 
He's coming down you know, Dumbledore. 
Says he wants to be with me when they... 
When it happens. 
Great man, Dumbledore. 
A great man. 
- We'll stay with you too. 
- You'll do no such thing! 
Think I want you seeing something like that? 
No. You just drink your tea and be off. 
Before you do, Ron... 
Scabbers! 
You're alive! - Keep a closer eye on your pets, Ron. 
- I think that means you owe someone an apology. Right. 
Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know. 
I meant me! 
Blimey. What was that? 
Hagrid! 
It's late. 
It's nearly dark. 
You shouldn't be here. 
Someone sees you outside the castle this time of night, you'll be in trouble. 
Big trouble. Particularly you, Harry. 
With you in a moment! 
Quick. 
Hagrid. 
- It'll be fine. It'll be okay. 
- Go on, go on! 
It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff known as Buckbeak hereinafter called" the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown. 
What? 
I thought I just saw... 
- Never mind. 
- Let's go! 
Oh, no. 
He bit me. 
Scabbers. 
Ron. Ron! 
- Scabbers, come back. 
Wait! 
- Scabbers, you bit me! 
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is? 
That's not good. 
Ron, run! 
Harry, Hermione, run! 
It's the Grim! 
- Ron! 
Come on! 
Duck! 
Harry! 
- Oh, I'm sorry. 
- Don't worry. 
- Where do you suppose this goes? 
- I have a hunch. 
I just hope I'm wrong. 
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we? 
Come on. 
Ron. 
Where is it? 
Harry, It's a trap. 
He's an Animagus. 
If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too! 
Only one will die tonight. 
Then it'll be you! 
Are you going to kill me, Harry? 
Well, well, Sirius. Looking rather ragged, aren't we? 
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within. 
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you, Remus? 
- I found him. - I know. - It's him. 
- I understand. 
- Let's kill him! 
I trusted you! 
And all this time, you've been his friend. 
He's a werewolf! 
That's why he's been missing classes. 
How long have you known? 
- Since Professor Snape set the essay. 
- Well, well, well, Hermione. You really are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met. 
Enough talk, Remus! Come on, let's kill him! 
- Wait! 
- I did my waiting! 
Twelve years of it! 
In Azkaban! 
Very well. 
Kill him. 
But wait one more minute. 
Harry has the right to know why. 
I know why. 
You betrayed my parents. 
- You're the reason they're dead! 
- No, Harry, it wasn't him. 
- Who was it, then? 
- Peter Pettigrew! 
And he's in this room! 
Right now! 
Come out, come out, Peter! 
- Come out, come out and play! - Expelliarmus! 
Vengeance is sweet. 
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you. 
I told Dumbledore you were helping your old friend into the castle And now here's the proof. 
Brilliant, Snape. 
Once again you've put your keen and penetrating mind to the task and as usual come to the wrong conclusion. 
Now, if you'll excuse us, Remus and I have some unfinished business to attend to. 
- Give me a reason. I beg you! - Severus, Don't be a fool. 
- He can't help it. It's habit by now. 
- Sirius, Be quiet. 
- Be quiet yourself, Remus! Listen to you two, quarrelling like an old married couple. 
Why don't you run along and play with your chemistry set! 
I could do it, you know. 
But why deny the dementors? They're so longing to see you. 
Do I detect a flicker of fear? Oh, yes. 
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like to endure. 
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best. 
Severus, please. 
After you. 
What did you just do? 
- You attacked a teacher! 
- Tell me about Peter Pettigrew. - He was at school with us. 
We thought he was our friend! 
Pettigrew's dead. You killed him! - No, he didn't. 
I thought so too, until you mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the map! 
- The map was lying, then. 
- The map never lies! 
Pettigrew's alive! 
And he's right there! 
! He's mental! - Not you! 
Your rat! 
- Scabbers has been in my family for... 
Curiously long life for a common garden rat! 
- He's missing a toe, isn't he? 
- So what? 
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his... 
- Finger! 
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead! 
- And then he transformed into a rat! - Show me. 
- Give it to him, Ron. 
- What are you trying to do to him? 
Leave him alone! Get off him! 
What are you doing? 
Remus? 
My old friends! 
Look at you. 
You look so much like your father. 
We were the best of friends, he and I... 
- How dare you speak to Harry! 
How dare you talk about James in front of him! 
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort, didn't you? 
You have no idea the weapons he possesses! 
Ask yourself, Sirius! What would you have done? 
- What would you have done? 
- I would've died, rather than betray my friends! 
Harry, James wouldn't have wanted me killed! 
Your dad would have spared me! 
He would have shown me mercy! 
You should've realized Peter, that if Voldemort didn't kill you, then we would. Together! 
No! 
- Harry, this man... 
- I know what he is. 
But we'll take him to the castle. 
- Bless you, boy. Bless you! 
- Get off! 
I said we'd take you to the castle. 
After that, the dementors can have you. 
Sorry about the bite. 
I reckon that twinges a bit. 
A bit? You almost tore my leg off! 
I was going for the rat. 
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog. 
In fact more than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent. 
The tail I could live with. 
But the fleas, they're murder. 
Okay. 
- You better go. - No. Don't worry, okay? 
It's fine. 
You go, I'll stay. 
- You okay? 
- I'm fine. 
- That looks really painful. 
- So painful. 
They might chop it. 
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat. 
It's too late. 
It's ruined. 
It'll have to be chopped off. 
It's beautiful, isn't it? 
I'll never forget the first time I walked through those doors. 
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man. 
That was a noble thing you did back there. 
He doesn't deserve it. 
Well, I just didn't think my dad would have wanted his two best friends to become killers. 
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him. 
Alive, you're free. 
good pet? 
You won't let them give me to the dementors, will you? I was your rat! 
- Sweet girl, clever girl! Surely you won't... - Get away from her! 
I don't know if you know, Harry but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather. 
I know. 
Well, I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle but if you ever wanted a different home... 
Come and live with you? 
I can understand if you don't want to. 
Harry! 
Remus, my old friend. 
Have you taken your potion tonight? 
You know the man you truly are, Remus! 
This heart is where you truly live! 
This flesh is only flesh! 
Harry! 
Run! 
Run! 
- Wait. Wait. Hermione! 
Professor? 
Professor Lupin? 
There you are, Potter! 
Come back here, Potter! 
Sirius! 
Harry? 
I saw my dad. 
What? 
He sent the dementors away. 
I saw him across the lake. 
They've captured Sirius. 
Any minute the dementors are going to perform the Kiss. 
- You mean, they're going to kill him? 
- No. It's worse. 
Much worse. 
They're going to suck out his soul. 
Headmaster, you've got to stop them. 
- They've got the wrong man. 
- It's true, sir. Sirius is innocent. 
- It's Scabbers who did it. 
He's my rat, sir. 
He's not really a rat. 
He was my brother Percy's rat. 
- But then they gave him an owl... - The point is, we know the truth. 
- Please believe us. 
- I do, Miss Granger. 
But I'm sorry to say the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others. 
A child's voice, however honest and true is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. 
Mysterious thing, time. 
Powerful and when meddled with, dangerous. 
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. 
You know the laws, Miss Granger. 
You must not be seen. 
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime. 
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. 
If you succeed tonight more than one innocent life may be spared. 
Three turns should do it, I think. 
Oh, and by the way. 
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin. 
Good luck. 
What the bloody hell was that all about? 
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk... 
What just happened? - Where's Ron? 
- 7 : 30. 
Where were we at 7 : 30? 
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's? 
Come on. 
Hermione! Hermione, wait. 
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing? 
Hermione, no! 
This is not normal. 
This is a Time-Turner, Harry. 
McGonagall gave it to me first term. 
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year. 
- You mean we've gone back in time? 
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment. 
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change. 
Good punch. 
Thanks. 
Malfoy's coming. - Run. 
- Not a word to anyone, understood? 
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! 
Mark my words. 
- That felt good. 
- Not good, brilliant. 
We should be at Hagrid's. 
Buckbeak's still alive. 
Of course. 
Remember what Dumbledore said? 
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared. 
Let's go. 
Here they come. I'd better hurry. 
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. 
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free. 
- Harry, you can't. 
- Hermione, that's the man who betrayed my parents. 
- You don't expect me to just sit here. 
- Yes, and you must! 
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now. 
If you just go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad. 
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time. 
We can't be seen. 
Fudge is coming. 
And we aren't leaving? 
Why aren't we leaving? 
Are you mad? 
That hurt. 
Sorry. 
Come on, we're coming out the back door. 
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back? 
What? 
I thought I just saw... 
- Never mind. 
- Let's go. 
Okay, go, Harry. Go! 
Get off. 
Come quickly. 
Come with us now. 
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly. 
Quickly. Hurry up. 
Come on, Buckbeak. 
Come and get the nice dead ferret. 
Come on, Beaky. 
Follow me. 
- Now, look there. 
See. 
- What am I supposed to see? 
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster. 
Indeed, indeed. 
- And all the strawberries, you see. 
- I see no strawberries. 
- Over there. 
- Over there. - This way. 
- Let's get this over, please. - All right. 
But where is it? 
I saw the beast, just now. 
- Not a moment ago! - How extraordinary. 
Buckbeak. 
Someone's obviously released him. - Hagrid? 
I don't think the minister's suggesting that you had anything to do with this, Hagrid. 
After all, how could you? 
You've been with us all the time. 
We must search the grounds. 
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister. Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy. 
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required. 
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor. 
- Come on. - This way. 
- Now what? 
- We save Sirius. 
- How? 
- No idea. 
- Look. It's Lupin. - Immobulus! 
And Snape's coming. 
And now we wait. 
And now we wait. 
- At least someone's enjoying himself. - Yeah. 
- Hermione? - Yeah? 
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius I did see someone. 
That someone made the dementors go away. 
With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore. 
According to him only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it. 
It was my dad. 
It was my dad who conjured the Patronus. 
- But Harry, your dad's... 
I'm just telling you what I saw. 
Here we come. 
You see Sirius talking to me there? 
- He's asking me to come live with him. 
- That's great. 
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'. 
It'll just be me and him. 
We could live in the country someplace you can see the sky. 
I think, he'll like that after all those years in Azkaban. 
- What are you doing? 
- Saving your life. 
Thanks. 
- Great. Now he's coming for us. 
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. 
That was so scary. 
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night. 
Sirius. 
Come on! 
- This is horrible. 
- Don't worry. My dad will come. 
He'll conjure the Patronus. 
Any minute now. 
Right there. 
Harry, listen to me. No one's coming. 
Don't worry, he will. He will come. 
- You're dying both of you. 
Harry! 
You were right, Hermione. 
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. 
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before. 
I knew I could do it this time because well, I had already done it. 
- Does that make sense? 
But I don't like flying...! 
I'll be forever grateful for this to both of you. 
- I want to go with you. 
- One day, perhaps. 
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable. 
And besides you're meant to be here. 
And you know it. 
And for now, that will do. 
I expect you're tired of hearing this but you look so like your father. 
Except your eyes. 
- You have... 
- My mother's eyes. 
It's cruel that I gotta spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little. 
But know this : 
The ones that love us never really leave us. 
And you can always find them in here. 
You really are the brightest witch of your age. 
We have to go. 
- Well? 
- He's free. 
We did it. Did what? 
Good night. 
How did you get there? 
I was talking to you there. 
And now you're there. 
- What's he talking about, Harry? 
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once? 
Hello, Harry. 
I saw you coming. 
I've looked worse, believe me. 
- You've been sacked. 
- No. No. I resigned, actually. 
Resigned? Why? 
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition. 
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want well, someone like me teaching their children. 
- Dumbledore has already risked enough on my behalf. 
Besides, people like me are... 
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now. 
Why do you look so miserable, Harry? 
None of it made any difference. 
- Pettigrew escaped. 
- Didn't make any difference? Harry, It made all the difference in the world. 
You helped uncover the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. 
It made a great deal of difference. 
If I am proud of anything it is of how much you have learned this year. 
Now, since I am no longer your teacher I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you. 
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry. 
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime. 
Until then mischief managed. 
Harry. 
Wherever did you get it? 
Can I have a go, Harry? 
After you, of course. 
- What are you talking about? 
- Quiet. Let the man through. 
I didn't mean to open it, Harry. It was badly wrapped. 
They made me do it. 
Did not. 
- It's a Firebolt. - It's the fastest broom in the world. 
- But who sent it? 
- No one knows. 
This came with it. 
- Go on, Harry! - Yeah, let's see. 
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. 
Excuse me. 
Come on, honey, let's get you ready for bed. 
I am no one special, just a common man with common thoughts. 
I've led a common life. 
There are no monuments dedicated to me. And my name will soon be forgotten. 
But in one respect, I've succeeded as gloriously as anyone who ever lived. 
- Looking good, Duke. 
- Feeling good. 
I've loved another with all my heart and soul and for me that has always been enough. 
I keep trying to die, but they won't let me. 
Well, you can't have everything. 
Big day today. 
You say that every day, you old devil. 
It's a lovely day outside. Let's take a walk. 
I don't think so. 
Well, we've got to get you out of this room. 
Come on now, honey. Some fresh air - would do you good. 
- Hello. 
I'm sorry, it's not a good day. 
I don't think she's up for anything. 
Hello? 
This is Duke, he's come to read to you. 
Read? 
No. I don't know. 
Oh, come on, you'll like him, he's very funny. 
All right now, where did we leave off? 
Oh, yeah, yeah, it was the night of the carnival. 
" Noah, was there with his friends, Fin and Sarah." 
- That's where they met... 
June 6th, 1940. 
Allie was 17 years old. 
- How are you? Hi, what's your name? 
- Who's this girl with Sara? 
- Her name's Allie Hamilton. 
She's here for the summer with her family. 
Dad's got more money than God. 
- Hi, honey. Look, I won you a prize. 
- You want to dance with me? - No. 
- Why not? 
-' Cause I don't want to. 
Noah, she's with us. 
Hey Allie, you want to ride the Ferris wheel? 
- Noah Calhoun. 
- What? 
Works down at the lumber yard with Fin. 
Did you see he was standing like two inches away from my face? 
Yeah, I saw. 
You know I'm surprised he even came over. I think he likes you. 
- Well, I... ugh! 
- What are you doing? - Hey, you can't do that! 
I'll pay you when I get down, Tommy. 
I'm Noah Calhoun. 
- So? ! 
- So, it's really nice to meet you. 
- Allie, who is this guy? 
- I don't know, Noah Calhoun. 
- I would really like to take you out. - Friend! 
Do you mind? 
You can't sit more than two people in a chair, Noah. Okay, Tommy, all right. 
Get down, Noah, you're gonna kill yourself! 
Noah, cut it out. Now, will you go out with me? 
- No. 
- No? - No. - No? 
Hey pal, she just told you. 
Why not? 
I don't know, because I don't want to. 
Well, you leave me no other choice then. 
Oh my God. 
I'm not kidding. - Noah, stop fooling around. 
- What are you doing? 
- I'm gonna ask you one more time. Will you... 
- or will you not go out with me? 
- Noah, you best come on. - God damn, my hand's slipping. 
- Then grab the bar, you idiot. - Not until she agrees. 
- Ah, go on out with him, honey. Okay, okay, fine, I'll go out with you. 
- What? - No, don't do me any favors. 
No, no. I want to. 
- You want to? 
You want to? - Yes! 
- Say it. - I want to go out with you. 
- I want to go out with you. 
All right, all right we'll go out. 
You think you're so smart, don't you? 
That wasn't funny, Noah, you idiot! 
No, it's okay, I'll take care of this. 
What are you doing? 
Please don't do that. Please don't do that, Allie. 
I can't believe... 
Oh God. 
You're not so cocky now, are ya? 
I'm gonna get you for that. 
Ah, maybe you will, maybe you won't. 
It's that girl from the Carnival, right? 
Do you remember me? 
Yeah, sure, Mr. Underwear, was it? 
- Well, I... 
- How could I forget. Yeah, I wanted to clear that up with you, because I'm really sorry about that. 
It was a really stupid thing to do... crawl up a Ferris wheel to talk to somebody. 
But I had to be next to you. 
I was being drawn to you. 
Oh... oh, jeez, what a line! 
You use that on all the girls? 
- No. 
- Right. I saw you the other night with little Miss Ribbons. 
- What are you doing tonight? 
- What? 
Or tomorrow night, or this weekend, whatever. 
- Why? 
- Why? Our date. 
What date? - The date that you agreed to. 
- No... Yes, you did. You promised and you swore it. 
Well, I guess I changed my mind. 
Look, I know you get some dirty guy coming up to you on the street... you don't know him. You don't know me, but I know me. 
And when I see something that I like, I gotta ha... I love it. 
I go... 
I mean, I go crazy for it. 
Okay, what are you talking about? 
Well, you. 
Oh, you're good. 
- What? 
- You're good. 
- No. No, you're getting me wrong. - You're good. 
- You're fantastic. - I'm not. 
You really are. I'm impressed. 
- I'm not usually like this, I'm sorry. 
- Oh, yes, you are. 
I can be fun, if you want... pensive, uh, smart, uh, superstitious, brave. 
I could be whatever you want. 
You just tell me what you want and I'll be that for you. 
You're dumb. 
I could be that. 
Come on, one date. What's it gonna hurt? Umm... 
I don't think so. 
Well, what I can I do to change your mind? Guess you'll figure something out. 
- You sure she's coming? - Relax, pal, it's all set up. 
We're meeting her for the late show. 
Oh my goodness, what a coincidence! 
- Allie, you remember Noah, don't you? 
- Yes, I remember. - Yeah. 
- Come here. 
- Fin! 
- Hi. 
- It's nice to see you again. - You too. 
- You look great. 
- Aw, thanks. 
Really, really great. 
You do look great. You look great. 
And I know I look great, so could we please go see this movie? - The show's about to start. 
- Want to walk with me? Yeah, what's going on? - Yeah. 
- We're gonna walk. 
Do you guys love each other? 
- You guys do love each other. - Don't do anything I wouldn't do. 
Okay, good bye. 
That was fun. 
I haven't seen a movie in ages. 
Really? 
Not since I was a little kid. 
What? 
No, I.. 
I'm busy, you know, I don't have a lot of time. 
You're busy? 
I have a very strict schedule. 
My days are all planned out. 
I get up in the morning... breakfast, math tutor, Latin tutor, lunch, tennis lessons, dance lessons... 
sometimes both... 
French tutor, piano lesson, then I eat dinner. And after dinner I spend time with my family. 
I catch up on some reading. 
Sounds like the road to success. 
Oh, you bet. 
We're applying to all these colleges... umm... 
those are the ones we want. 
- And who's we? 
- What? 
You just said," The ones that we want." 
Oh, Mom and Daddy. We decide everything together. 
Everything? 
No, not everything. But the important things, yes. 
And then everything else, you get to decide all by yourself? 
- Don't be rude. 
- I'm sorry. 
Just trying to figure out what you do for fun. 
What do you mean? 
I don't know, I mean all those things are things you have to do, right? 
So what do you do because you want to? 
I just told ya. 
I don't know. This surprises me. 
I just always figured you were kinda... 
Kinda what? Just... 
- Free. - What? 
Free. 
I am free. 
You don't seem like it. 
Well, I am. 
Come here, I want to show you something. - Noah, what are you doing? 
- Just come on. 
- You're gonna get run over. 
- By all the cars? 
My Dad and I used to come out here and lay down and watch the lights change. 
And watch them go from green to red to yellow. 
You could try it, if you wanted to. 
- No. 
- Why not? 
Because I don't know... will you just get up? 
That's your problem, you know that? 
You don't do what you want. 
Okay. 
What happens if a car comes? 
- We die. 
- What? 
Just relax. Just trust. 
You need to learn how to trust. 
Okay. 
You asked me what I do for me. - What now? 
- I love to paint. 
Yeah? 
Most of the time, I have all these thoughts bouncing around in my head. 
But with a brush in my hand, the world just gets kinda quiet. 
Are you okay? 
Why are you laughing? 
Oh, that was fun. 
Do you want to dance with me? 
Sure. 
Now? 
Here? 
Not supposed to dance in the middle of the street. 
Who said dance in the street? 
And we don't have any music. 
You're a terrible singer. 
I know. 
But I like this song. 
- Southern summers are indifferent to the trials of young love. ♪ The wishing well ♪ 
- Armed with warnings and doubts, 
Noah and Allie gave a remarkably convincing portrayal of a boy and a girl traveling down a very long road with no regard for the consequences. 
They fell in love, didn't they? 
- Yes, they did. 
- Good. I like this kind of story. Go on. 
After that night, Allie and Noah spent every waking hour together. 
And soon they were inseparable. - Noah, come on. 
That's really nice. 
Hey, look, we got a visitor. 
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. 
Well, don't apologize, come on up here, darling. 
We could use a little something here besides the smell of lumber. 
Dad, this is Allison Hamilton. 
Allison, I'm glad to meet you. - Allie. 
- Allie. 
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Calhoun. 
Well Mr. Calho... What, am I old or something? You can call me Frank. 
- Here, come in and have a seat. - Okay. 
Well, yeah, she is pretty, son. - Yes. 
- She's a lot prettier than you let on. 
- No, it's not right. 
Don't believe what he says. 
I brought you something. Let me see. 
Let's have a look. 
Did you do this? Well, that's beautiful. 
Look at that. 
That's a damn picture there. 
Well, I know just where we can put that, thank you. 
Oh, that was a lovely poem. What was it? 
- EI... - Whitman. 
See when he was a little kid he used to stutter real bad. - Dad... 
- So... well, you did. 
- I didn't know that. - God. I stammered. 
Couldn't understand a damn thing he said. 
So, I got him to read me poetry out loud. 
It wasn't very pretty at first, but then his stutter went away. Well, it's a good idea, that poetry. 
Yeah, I thought so. 
Unbelievable, unbelievable. 
I'm a Tennyson man, myself, but he likes Whitman... For some reason, I don't know. 
Say, how would you like some breakfast? Would you like some breakfast? 
- Breakfast? 
- Dad, it's 10 : 00. - What's that got to do with it? 
You can have pancakes any damn time of night you want. - Come on, you want some breakfast? 
It was an improbable romance. 
He was a country boy. She was from the city. 
She had the world at her feet, while he didn't have two dimes to rub together. 
Look at us. 
What are we doing? 
Do you think in another life, I could have been a bird? 
What do you mean? 
Like reincarnation. 
I don't know. 
I think I could. 
Say I'm a bird. 
No. 
- Don't do it. - Say I'm a bird. 
Stop it. Stop it now. - You're not. 
- You're a bird. 
Now say you're a bird too. 
If you're a bird, I'm a bird. 
Real easy, on three, ready? - Okay, okay. 
Get in the water! 
- Get in! I'm sorry. 
- Come on, chicken. Get in the water, baby. 
- Get in the water. - I can't. - Go! 
- Get in the water! - One... - Come on, jump. 
They didn't agree on much. In fact, they rarely agreed on everything. 
They fought all the time. 
- Don't kick me! - Don't push me. 
And they challenged each other every day. 
But despite their differences, they had one important thing in common. 
They were crazy about each other. 
- No. 
- Yes, I do. 
Allie. 
Daddy. 
Oh, Daddy you're... I didn't see you there. 
Becoming friendly with that boy down there. Yes. 
Bring him to the house on Sunday. I want to meet this young man. 
Okay. 
Good night. 
Olivier, please remove the... the liquor decanter from in front of my husband. I think he's had a little too much to drink. 
So, what do you do, Noah? 
I work at the lumber yard with Fin. 
Mainly milling and receiving logs... and stripping the bark. 
Thank you. 
If you don't mind my asking, uh, how much do you make at your job? 
Uh, how much money do I make? 
About 40 cents an hour. 
Yeah, it's not much, but I don't need a lot. And I... I save most of it. 
Let's eat. Shall we? Yes! 
So Noah, you and Allie have been spending a lot of time together. 
You must be very fond of each other. 
It's getting pretty serious, huh? 
Yes, ma'am. 
Well, summer's almost gone. 
What will you do? 
You know, Charleston's only a couple of hours away. 
But Allie's going to Sarah Lawrence. 
Didn't she tell you? 
No, she didn't tell me that. 
I just got the letter. I was going to tell you. It's okay. 
And Sarah Lawrence is in New York. 
I didn't know that. 
Anne, this conversation's too stuffy for the dinner table. 
Let the children have fun without bringing in the Spanish Inquisition. 
My lips are buttoned, right now. 
I do know another joke about the Nun and the full standing bishop. 
That child's got too much spirit for a girl of her circumstance. 
Nah, it's just summer love. 
Trouble is what it is. 
Is that Allie out there? 
Do you want to go somewhere? Okay. 
Allie! 
Don't open your eyes. 
Okay. 
The Windsor Plantation. It was built in 1772. 
Rumor has it that Francis Marion... Proposed to his wife right here under these... uh, these steps. 
- Watch out. You be careful, these are broken. Look at that. 
This place is gigantic. 
Yeah, a gigantic piece of crap. 
But I'm gonna buy it one day and I'm gonna fix it up. 
All it needs is a new floor. 
And new walls and a roof. 
- Is that all? 
- And plumbing and electric. - And furniture. - Yes, and furniture. 
But it's right on the water. 
And there's a big old barn out there... I could turn that into my workshop. 
Well, what about me? 
Now don't I get any say in this? 
You want a say in this? 
Yes, I would. 
What do you want? 
I want a white house... with blue shutters... 
And a room overlooking the river so I can paint. 
- Anything else? - Yes. 
I want a big old porch that wraps around the entire house. 
We can drink tea... and watch the sun go down. 
- Okay. 
- You promise? Mm-hmm, I promise. 
Good. 
- Where are you going? 
- In here. 
I can't play chopsticks if you're doing that. 
Um... 
I know I said that I wanted you to make love to me, - but I think you... - Yeah? 
- Did I hurt you? - No, no. 
I'm just... 
I'm just having a lot of thoughts. I'm just... 
I'm just having a lot of... never mind. 
Like what are you thinking? What are you thinking, right now? You know, right this second? 
Did you know that this was going to happen when you brought me here? 
- No. 
- No? 
- No. - No, you didn't think about it? 
- Of course I thought about it. 
- You did? 
- Well, what did you think? 
Uh, I'm talking too much, aren't I? 
Okay, okay, I'm just going to shut up. 
- You all right? 
I just don't understand how come you're so quiet. 
You don't have one thought? 
I'm going crazy over here, but no, with you, everything's fine. 
You don't have a care in the world? 
I'm sorry. 
I wanted this to be so perfect. Now I can't shut up. 
I love you. 
Did you know that? 
I love you too. 
You don't have to do this if you don't want to. 
No, no, I want to, I do. 
Noah! What? Fin, get out of here! 
Look, I'm sorry, but Allie's parents are going crazy. 
They got every cop in town out looking for her. 
- Yes. It is two in the morning. 
We sent the police. 
Thank God you're all right. 
Where you been? 
Mr. Hamilton, all this is my fault. 
Would you give us a moment please? I'd like to talk to my daughter. 
Alone, young lady. 
Sir, it's really not her fault. I lost track of time. 
Sit down. 
- No. 
- You are going to stop seeing Noah. 
She is out fooling around with that boy till 2 : 00 in the morning and it has got to stop. 
I didn't spend 17 years of my life raising a daughter and giving her everything... so she could throw it away on a summer romance. 
Daddy, come on! 
She will wind up with her heart broken or pregnant. - Anne, please. 
- Now, he is a nice boy. - He's a nice boy, but he's... 
- He's what? 
He's what? Tell me. He is trash, trash, trash... 
Trash? 
Don't touch me! 
You are not to see him anymore. 
And that's final. - No, it's not final. 
- Yes it is. 
- No, it's not final! - Allie! 
You're not going to tell me who I'm gonna love. 
- Yes Daddy, I love him. 
He's not suitable for you, baby. 
I love him. 
You are 17 years old, you don't know anything about love. 
Oh, and you do? 
You don't look at Daddy the way I look at Noah. You don't touch or laugh. You don't play. 
You don't know anything about love. 
You leaving? 
Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I don't even know what to say. 
- It's all right. 
- No, it's not. - Yeah. 
- I'm gonna go. 
- No, I don't want you to go. 
I got to think about some stuff. 
What do you got to think about, huh? 
Come here and talk to me. Talk to me! About what? 
You want... you're going away! 
You're leaving. 
And I'm staying here. 
And I'm so happy that you're doing it, but you're gonna have a million things to do. 
- No. - You got so much ahead of you. 
- Don't talk like that. 
I'm not going to have nice things, fancy things. 
It doesn't... 
It's never gonna happen for me. It's not in the cards for me. 
I don't have to go to school, okay? - Yes, you do. 
- I can stay here. 
Do you see, that's exactly what I am talking about. 
Then you can come with me. 
- To New York? 
- Yes. 
What am I going to do in New York? 
Be with me? 
I don't know. 
We don't got to figure all this out tonight, ya know? 
We'll finish out the summer and we'll see what happens. 
You saying you want to break it off? 
What I'm saying we see how it goes later on. 
Are you breaking up with me? 
I don't see how it's gonna work. 
I see... 
Please don't do this. 
You don't mean it. 
Oh hell, well if you're going to do it, why wait until the summer ends, huh? 
Why don't you just do it, right now? 
Come on. - Come on. 
- What are you doing? 
You know what? I'm gonna do it. It's over. 
Okay? It's over. 
- Come here. 
- Don't touch me. I hate you, I hate you. 
I'm gonna go. Why don't you, why don't you just go. Get out. 
Come on. 
This is just a fight we're having, and tomorrow it will be like it never happened, right? 
- Going? 
- Gone. 
Well, she must have been devastated. 
He was only trying to do the right thing. 
Yeah. 
But what he really should have done is just told those parents to go to hell. Just stick it where the sun don't shine. 
Yeah, you're right, probably should have. 
The next day, Allie woke up to find her world completely changed. 
What's going on? 
We're going home. 
We're going now? 
No, we're not supposed to be leaving for another week. 
Get dressed and then come and have some breakfast, dear. 
Willow will pack your things. Why, I'd be happy to pack your things, Miss Allie. 
I don't want you to pack my things. 
I don't want you to touch my stuff. I'm not going. 
- Yes, you are. 
- No, I'm not. - Yes, Allie, you are. 
- No, I'm not. Allie, you are going whether you like it or not. 
Now, even if Aaron has to throw you over his shoulder and drag you the whole way, you're going. 
Where's Noah? He's out delivering a load. 
- What's going on? 
- I'm leaving town. 
- Leaving? - Yeah. 
- When? 
- Now, right now... like today. 
Look, I need you to tell Noah something, okay? 
I need you to tell him that I love him. And tell him that I'm sorry for everything, okay? 
Look, I was up all night with him, Allie. I've never seen him so low. 
It's over. Don't make it any harder than it already is. 
No, it's not over. 
Fin, we had a fight last night. No, we said some things we didn't mean, but it's not over. 
- It is over. - No. 
Leave it alone. Let it go. 
I'm coming. Mama, I'm coming! 
- Look, he understands. 
- But... 
It's hard, but he really does. Summer's over and it's time to go home. 
If he wants to talk to you, he'll write. 
If not? 
Okay. 
Okay, can you just... can you just tell him that I love him, then? - Can you do that? 
- I'll tell him. 
Bye, Fin. 
Summer romances end for all kinds of reasons. 
But when all is said and done, they have one thing in common : 
They are shooting stars... a spectacular moment of light in the heavens, a fleeting glimpse of eternity. 
And in a flash, they're gone. 
Noah was desperate. 
He wrote to Allie that he was sorry and stupid for breaking up with her. 
He wrote to tell her that he still loved her, and he wanted to see her. 
And that if she would write back, he would come to wherever she was. 
He wrote one letter a day for a year... 365 letters, but they all went unanswered. 
Finally, after a year of silence, he decided to put it all behind him and start a new life. 
So he wrote a farewell letter And he and Fin packed their bags and headed for Atlanta. 
A state of war has existed between the United States and the... 
Noah and Fin enlisted together. 
And after two years of chasing Rommel through the North African desert, they were deployed to Patton's Third Army in Europe. 
Allie was in her third year of college when she volunteered as a nurse's aid. 
To her, the broken men with shattered bodies, who filled the ward were all Noah. 
Or someone who fought beside him in the jungle or frozen snow swept road. 
I'm gonna lift you up. Ready? 
Now, I'm gonna bring this leg over. 
- You okay? 
Miss, can I ask you a question? 
I noticed that you aren't wearing a ring. 
And I was wondering if I could take you out. - Excuse me? 
- On a date. 
Now, before you go and say no, 
I'll have you know that I am an excellent dancer and my intentions are completely dishonorable. 
Okay, okay" Casanova," come on. 
Let's just get you better, then we'll talk about a date, okay? 
Oh my gosh, he is dreamy. What is he doing here? 
He's staring at you. 
Oh, miss? 
I'm all better. 
Now, how's about that date? 
Allie was surprised how quickly she fell in love with Lon Hammond. 
He was handsome, smart, funny, sophisticated and charming. 
He also came from old Southern money, and was fabulously wealthy. 
Allie, I've been thinking a lot about why we shouldn't get married. 
Okay, I give up, why shouldn't we get married? 
Well see, that's the thing, I couldn't think of anything at first. An then, it just dawned on me. 
- My parents? - Absolutely. 
Your old mom and dad. Thank you for that. 
Mom? You see, the problem is that they love me. 
- I'm exactly the type of man - They do. - They want you to end up with. 
- Really? 
You know, I'm wealthy, I'm from the South, I got a decent job. 
You know, I'm an incredible dancer, I'm a really smart guy. 
- I like to think... - So what's the problem, huh? 
Now just this, if you marry me... 
Now listen close. If you marry me... Then you will have lost a life long battle of defiance against them. 
Oh my goodness, what are we going to do? 
I do not know. 
damn it, I think you have to marry me. - I think you need to marry me. 
- I do? 
- Yes you do. - I do, why? Because if you do, you parents will always know the unhappiness that you feel for not being able to disappoint them. 
I think you may have overlooked one minor detail. 
And what's that? 
Well, you see you have to get their permission first. 
And I think you may have overestimated their affection for you. 
Is that right? 
- Mm-hmm. - Oh, I don't think so. 
Then why not? 
Oh,' cause I asked them already and they said yes. 
What? 
One more thing. 
I love you. 
Will you marry me, honey? 
I know I kid around a lot, but I'm crazy about you. 
Marry me? Make me the happiest man in the world. 
Yes. Yes! 
- Where are you going? 
I'd like everyone here to know that this young lady and I are getting married. 
She agreed with all her heart, but couldn't understand why at the very moment she said yes, Noah's face came to her mind. 
Oh, good to see you. Let me see you. 
You bleeding anywhere? No? 
- Everything good? 
Oh, I love you. 
Come on, there's something I got to show you. - Come on. - All right. 
What's going on? 
What is this? 
I sold the house. 
- You sold the house? 
- Yup. Gotta be out by the end of the month. 
Between that and your GI Bill, you ought to be able to get it now. 
- Get what? 
- Your dream house. - The Windsor Plantation. 
Now, don't Dad me, I don't want to hear about it. 
I already talked to the bank, they're gonna give you the loan. 
- Well, I can't let you sell your house. 
It's a good thing. 
You sell the house, where are you gonna live? 
With you, dummy, what do you think? 
Somebody's got to help you fix it up. 
Noah took a look at the house, but only saw one thing... 
Allie. 
He decided right there to fulfill his life-long dream. 
He would rebuild the old house from the ground up. 
And when Noah went to Charleston to get the building plans approved, fate stepped in and dealt him a sweet card. 
Stop the bus! Stop the bus. 
Sorry, Mac, I can't stop the bus until I get to the depot. 
No, no, no, please stop the bus now. 
Do you understand English, pal? 
No one gets off till we get to the depot. 
After seeing Allie that day, something inside Noah snapped. 
He got the notion into his head that if he restored the old house where they had come that night, Allie would find a way to come back to him. 
Some called it a labor of love. Others called it something else. 
But in fact, Noah had gone a little mad. 
It's time to eat. 
The melon is good. 
Did they ever see each other again? 
Noah and Allie? Now you don't want me to spoil the end of the story before I get to the good part, do you? 
Where did I leave off? 
When Noah's father died in November, the house was all he had. 
In time, Noah finished the house. 
He took a good look at what he had accomplished, got rip-roaring drunk for 10 days, thought seriously about setting it on fire, then finally put the house up for sale. 
I'm prepared to offer you this much. 
He had a number of interested buyers, but he always found a reason not to sell it to them. 
Either the bids were too low, or if they met his asking price, he felt it was worth a lot more. 
It's a lot of money, but I'll take it. 
$ 50,000. 
- That's more than my asking price. 
- That's right. It's a great deal more. 
He told the man that offered him $ 5,000 over his price that no one in his right mind would do that and he wouldn't have a lunatic living in his house. 
He worked out his frustration with life on the creek every morning. 
And in the evenings, to temper the sting of loneliness, there was Martha Shaw. 
Martha was a war widow who lived in Quail Ridge, a town away. 
So you want to go out tomorrow? 
I got to work. 
Well, we could down to the river if you want to. 
Next week, sometime. 
Maybe we could take a drive somewhere? 
No. 
Well, I'm just asking you. 
What do you want, Noah? 
What do you mean, what do I want? 
From me. 
Sometimes when you talk to me, you don't even see me. 
Look, a woman knows when a man looks into her eyes and sees someone else. 
Now you know I want to give you all the things that you want, right? 
But I can't, because they're gone... they're broken. 
Is the veil too much? 
Are you kidding? 
- You look gorgeous, honey. 
- Thank you. 
Wait until Lon sees you in this dress, he's gonna go crazy. 
He won't be able to take his eyes off you, or his hands. 
The" Daily Journal" says that you are going to be - the social highlight of the season. 
This is gonna be a celebration the likes of which this town's never seen! 
- Mama, look, the Governor's coming. 
- He better. Let me see. 
Oh, boy. 
- Yes. You have a visitor. 
Well, hello. Baby, I didn't know you were coming. I'm... 
I'm so sorry, I should have called. 
Baby, what are you talking about? 
- Guys, could you give us a minute? - All right. 
So what's up? 
I don't paint anymore. 
I used to paint all the time. 
I really loved it. 
- I didn't know that. 
So paint. I will. 
- I'm gonna start. 
- Great. 
Is everything okay? 
I need to get away. 
Okay. 
I need to take care of a few things. 
I need to clear my head. 
Okay, should I be worried? - No, I don't think so. 
- Oh, that's reassuring. 
Listen, are you all right? 
- Yeah. 
- Okay, then go. 
Take your time, do whatever you need to do. 
It's okay to be nervous, all right? 
It's normal to get cold feet before your wedding. 
No, no second thoughts. 
I love you. 
I'm going to be back from Seabrook in a couple of days, okay? 
- Seabrook? 
- Yeah, Seabrook. 
Hello. 
I saw your picture in the paper, the one with you and the house. 
And I just wanted to come and see if you were okay. 
I mean, I wasn't in the neighborhood or anything. I just... 
So are you okay? 
Okay, good. 
I'm a stupid woman, I shouldn't have come. 
You want to come in? 
Okay. 
This is a good story. 
I'm glad you like it. 
I think I've heard it before. 
Yes. 
Perhaps more than once? 
Doctor needs to see you. - Me? 
Now? 
- No, him. 
But he hasn't finished reading his story. 
I'll read some more when I'm through with the doctor. 
This shouldn't take too long. 
- All right. 
- Don't you go away. 
While you waiting, maybe you'd like to play the piano for a few minutes. You do like that. 
I do? 
- I don't know any tunes. 
- You can read music. 
No kidding? 
Who are you? 
I'm Dr. Barnwell, one of the new attending physicians. 
We haven't met, so I thought I'd examine you myself. 
Okay, so I see here that you've had two heart attacks over the last 18 months. 
Yeah, minor ones, I think one was angina. 
- Okay, any complications? 
- Nope, feel fine. 
Okay, deep breath for me. 
Okay, one more time. 
Terrific, terrific. 
You still taking your medication? 
- Every day, twice a day. - Good, good, good, good, good. 
Okay, you can put your shirt on. 
So I understand that you read to Miss Hamilton. 
Yeah, to help her remember. 
- You don't think it'll help? No, I don't. 
She remembers, Doc. 
I read to her and she remembers. 
Not always, but she remembers. 
But senile dementia is irreversible. 
It's degenerative. 
After a certain point, its victims don't come back. 
Yeah, that's what they keep telling me. 
Well, I just don't want you to get your hopes up. 
Well, thanks, Doc, but you know what they say? Science goes only so far and then comes God. 
Then comes God. 
Damn, I forgot to turn the page for her. 
You through with me? 
I guess they flipped that page. 
No, that she's playing by memory. 
His name is Lon Hammond, Jr. 
Hammond? 
As in Hammond Cotton? 
As in Hammond Cotton. 
Well, your parents must love him. 
He's a really good man, Noah. You'd really like him. 
You love him? 
Yeah, I do. 
I love him very much. 
Well, that's that. 
You marry Lon and we can be friends... right? 
Right. 
Are you hungry? 
Do you want to stay for dinner? 
I have to warn you, I'm a cheap drunk. 
A couple more of these and you're gonna be carrying me right out of here. 
Well, you go slow then, I don't want to have to take advantage of you. 
You wouldn't dare. 
I'm a married woman. 
Not yet. 
What? 
Why are you looking at me like that? 
Just memories. 
This room. 
This... is this where we... 
This is the room? 
- I'm full. 
- Me too. 
It was real, wasn't it? 
You and me. 
Such a long time ago, we were just a couple of kids. 
But we really loved each other, didn't we? 
I should go. 
Goodbye. 
Do you think you could back tomorrow morning? 
There's some place I'd like to show you. 
Please. 
- Okay. 
She had come back into his life like a sudden flame, blazing and streaming into his heart. 
Noah stayed up all night contemplating the certain agony he knew would be his, if he were to lose her twice. 
Oh, I do wish I could figure out the end of this story. 
The children are here. 
Children? - Not yours, his. - Oh... 
Do you mind? 
Why, I'd love to meet them. 
Come over here. 
- Hi, Daddy. - Hi, Maggie. 
Hi, I'm Allie. - Hi, I'm Mary Allen. 
- Mary Allen. 
- Nice to see you. 
- Hi. - Hi, Maggie. 
Maggie, how are you? 
Hello there, honey. Hi, Davanee. 
- What a pretty name. 
- Oh, how cute, thank you. 
- And who's this? 
- Edmond. 
Hi, Edmond. 
You know, I think I'll run on up and take my afternoon nap, all right? 
- Come on, honey, let's go. 
I'll read some more later. 
All right, thank you. 
I'm so happy to meet you all. 
- She seems good today. 
- She is good. 
I don't know, there's something about today. 
Maybe it's a day for a miracle. 
Daddy, come home. 
Mama doesn't know us. She doesn't recognize you. 
She'll never understand. 
We miss you. This is crazy, you living here. 
Yeah, you know we'll all help with Mom. 
We can take shifts visiting. 
Look, guys, that's my sweetheart in there. 
I'm not leaving her. 
This is my home now. 
Your mother is my home. 
- Hey, there. 
Hi, who is this? 
It's Lon, who were you expecting? 
Uh, nobody, I... I just... I'm just surprised. 
Well, there's only one hotel in Seabrook. And when you didn't call, I got worried. 
Where you been? 
Are you all right? 
You know, I feel like an idiot,' cause I called your hotel about a hundred times. 
I'm fine. 
Anything you want to tell me? - No. 
- No? 
Okay. 
Lon, I love you. Call you tomorrow? 
Well, we better get going, the rain's coming in. 
- You like it? - It's spectacular. 
It's like a dream. 
- Do you want to feed them? - Yeah. 
What are they all doing here? 
I don't know. 
They're supposed to migrate to the Guatemala sound. 
They won't stay here? 
No... they'll go back where they came from. 
You're different. 
What do you mean? 
Just the way you look. 
Everything. You look different too, but in a good way. 
You know, you're kinda the same though. 
Yeah? 
And you really did it. 
- What? - Everything. 
The house... it's beautiful what you did. 
Well, I promised you I would. 
Great. 
We got to go. 
Why didn't you write me? 
Why? 
It wasn't over for me. 
I waited for you for seven years. And now it's too late. 
I wrote you 365 letters. 
I wrote you every day for a year. 
- You wrote me? 
- Yes. 
You... 
It still isn't over. 
You got to be kidding me. 
All this time, that's what I'd been missing? 
Let's do it again. 
Noah. 
Wake up. Wake up. 
- You're trying to kill me, woman. 
I need rest. 
I need food so I can regain my strength. 
Okay, what do you want? 
Umm... umm... some pancakes. 
She's the one, isn't she? 
Can I meet her? 
I'd really like to meet her. I don't know if that's a good idea, Martha. 
So this is Martha? 
Hi, I'm Allie. I've heard a lot about you. 
I've heard a lot about you, too. 
You want to come in? 
Are you sure? 
Yeah, yeah, Noah's just saying how hungry he was. 
And, you know, you could put on a pot of tea. 
Come on in. 
It was nice meeting you, Martha. - Nice meeting you too. 
- Goodbye. 
She's sensational. 
She really is. 
I'm really glad that I came, Noah. 
I'd forgotten what it's like. 
For the first time since I lost Richard, I feel like I've got something to look forward to. 
Lon is on his way here. 
I'm afraid your father spilled the beans about Noah, and when Lon didn't hear from you again last night, he decided to come. 
Well, that's great. 
That's just terrific. You, me, Noah and Lon, one big happy family. 
Tell me about the letters, Mother. 
- Is it true? 
You watched me cry myself to sleep for months and months and you never said anything. 
- How could you do that? - I'm sorry. 
- You're sorry? 
You're sorry? - Yes, I am... I am sorry. 
Okay, yes, I stole your letters. It was wrong, but stop being dramatic and at least take some of the responsibility. 
You came down here. 
You knew what you were doing. 
You knew this would happen. 
Oh, so now I'm a tramp? 
Go on and get some clothes on. 
Let's take a drive. 
Let's take a drive? Why would I want to go anywhere with you? 
Because I might know you a little better than you think. 
And I don't want you waking up one morning thinking that if you'd known everything, you might have done something different. 
What are we doing here, Mama? 
Do you see that man, there? 
Don't look like it now, but 25 years ago... oh my goodness, he was really something. 
We were out of our minds in love, let me tell you. 
Well, naturally, your grandfather was furious, so... we decided to run away. 
We didn't even make the next town before the police picked us up. 
But that was then. 
You know sometimes when I'm in the area, 
I just stop here and I watch him, trying to picture how different my life might have been. 
I want you to know that I love your father. 
- No, goddamn it, this is important and you need to hear it. 
I do. He is a wonderful man. He is good to me and I don't deserve him. 
I love him, Allie, I do, I love him. 
I know. 
Oh, this is just very embarrassing. 
I don't even know who that person is. 
Allie! 
I hope you make the right choice. 
Interesting morning? 
Lon's here in town. 
He's here? 
Yeah, we saw his car on the way, at the hotel. 
I see you got my letters. 
Finally. 
What are you going to do, Al? 
I don't know. 
We're back to that? 
Are we back there? 
What about the past couple of days? 
They happened, you know? I know that they happened, and they were wonderful, but they were also very irresponsible. 
I have a fiance waiting for me at a hotel, who's going to be crushed 
- when he finds out. - So you make love to me and then you go back to your husband? 
Was that your plan? 
Was that a test that I didn't pass? 
! No, I made a promise to a man, he gave me a ring and I gave him my word. 
And your word is shot to hell now, - don't you think? 
I don't know. I'll find out when I talk to him. 
This is not about keeping your promise, and it's not about following your heart, it's about security. 
- What is that supposed to mean? 
- What are you ta... - He's got a lot of money. 
- Now I hate you, you smug bastard. 
- Well, I hate you. - If you leave here, I hate you. - You wou... 
- Have you been paying attention to anything that's happening? I guess not. 
I think I must have misread 
You're bored. 
You're bored and you know it. You wouldn't be here if there wasn't something missing. 
You arrogant son of a bitch! 
Would you just stay with me? 
Stay with you? What for? 
- Look at us, we're already fighting. 
- Well, that's what we do. 
We fight. You tell me when I'm being an arrogant son of a bitch and I tell you when you're being a pain in the ass. 
Which you are 99 % of the time. 
I'm not afraid to hurt your feelings. 
They have like a two second rebound rate and you're back doing the next pain-in-the-ass thing. 
So, what? So it's not gonna be easy. It's gonna be really hard. 
And we're gonna have to work at this every day, but I want to do that, because I want you. 
I want all of you, forever, you and me, every day. 
Will you do something for me? Please? Will you just picture your life for me? 
30 years from now, 40 years from now, what's it look like? 
If it's with that guy, go! 
Go! 
I lost you once, I think I could do it again, if I thought it's what you really wanted. 
But don't you take the easy way out. 
What easy way? 
There is no easy way, no matter what I do, somebody gets hurt. 
Would you stop thinking about what everyone wants. 
Stop thinking about what I want, what he wants, what your parents want. 
What do you want? 
- What do you want? - It's not that simple. 
- What do you want? 
Goddamn it, what do you want? 
I have to go. 
My dearest Allie, 
I couldn't sleep last night because I know that it's over between us. 
I'm not bitter anymore, because I know that what we had was real. 
And if in some distant place in the future we see each other in our new lives, 
I'll smile at you with joy and remember how we spent a summer beneath the trees learning from each other and growing in love. 
The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds. 
And that's what you've given me. 
That's what I'd hoped to give to you forever. 
I love you. I'll be seeing you, Noah. 
It's beautiful. 
It's a beautiful story. 
Yes, it is. 
I don't know why, but it makes me feel sad. 
I know you feel lost right now, but don't worry, nothing is ever lost, nor can be lost. 
Did you write that? 
No, that was Walt Whitman. 
I think I knew him. 
I think you did. 
Shall we go in? 
I'm feeling a little chilly. 
Well, who did all of this? 
I did, with a little help from my friends on the nursing staff. 
I've never seen anything so beautiful. 
Neither have I. 
Shall we? 
Ah, so many pills. 
How sick are you? 
The sickness has become a relative term for me. 
I think of it now as more a general wearing out process. 
To you. 
So what happened? 
In the story, which one did she choose? 
Okay, the way I see it, I got three choices. 
One, I can shoot him. 
Two, I can kick the crap out of him. 
Or three... I leave you. 
Well, all that's no good. 
You see,' cause... none of those options get me you. 
And in spite of everything, 
I love you. 
I love you too. 
I meant what I said when I gave you that ring. 
I did too. 
It's just that when I'm... when I'm with Noah I feel like one person and when I'm with you I feel like someone totally different. 
Look, it's normal not to forget your first love. 
I love you, Allie, but I want you for myself. 
I don't want to have to convince my fiance that she should be with me. 
You don't have to. 
I already know I should be with you. 
And they lived happily ever after. 
Who? 
Who did? 
Oh yes, of course. 
I remember now. 
It was us. 
- It was us. 
It was us. - Oh, my darling. 
Noah, Noah. I love you, Angel. 
- What happened to me? 
- Nothing. You just went away for a little while. 
- How much time do we have? 
- I'm not sure. Last time it was no more than five minutes. 
Okay. 
Hey, I brought along an old friend. 
♪ In that small cafe... ♪ 
- How are the children? 
Now, they were here today... Little Noah, Davanee too.

You know what we could do? 
Maybe we could get a car and we could go for a ride. 
Why could get out of here and just go someplace, you want to? 
I don't think so. Not tonight, darling. 
Come on, why not? 
Wait a minute... why did you call me darling? I don't know you. 
What's going on here? 
Am I supposed to know you?

Allie, sweetheart. 
Hey, Allie, I love you, stay with me, don't leave...

Morning, Mr. Calhoun. 
Mr. Calhoun? 
Call Dr. Von Pettit and USC, okay? 
We talked about this. It's all right now. 
Come on, come on, precious. 
Oh, Mr. Calhoun. 
Welcome back. 
- Fine. Fit as a fiddle. 
- Where you going? - I was just taking a walk. 
I can't sleep. Well, you know you're not supposed to, it's against the rules. 
Yeah, I know. 
You weren't really going for a walk, were you? 
You were going to see Miss Allie. 
I just got out of the hospital and I miss her. 
Mr. Calhoun, I'm sorry, but I can't let you see her tonight. 
Now you're gonna have to go back to your room. 
As for me, I'm gonna go downstairs and get myself a cup of coffee. 
I won't be back to check on you for a while, so don't do anything foolish. 
Hi. 
Noah. 
Noah. 
Hi, sweetheart. 
I'm sorry I haven't been able to be here to read to you. 
I didn't know what to do. 
I was afraid you were never coming back. 
I'll always come back. 
What's gonna happen when I can't remember anything any more? 
What will you do? 
I'll be here. I'll never leave you. 
I need to ask you something. 
What is it, sweetheart? 
Do you think that our love can create miracles? 
Yes, I do. 
That's what brings you back to me each time. 
Do you think our love could take us away together? 
I think our love can do anything we want it to. 
I love you. 
I love you, Allie. 
Good night.

Come on, Marty. Just wanted to wish you a happy birthday. 
Hey, man, thanks. 
Hey, I got something stuck in my teeth. 
It's driving me crazy. 
Can you help me? 
Please? 
You came to the right place, my friend. 
Dr Marty, D.D.S., is in the house. 
Please hop on top of my sterilised examination table, if you may. 
- I don't see anything. 
Oh, sorry. Okay, just don't talk with your mouth full. 
Right here. 
What the heck is this doing in there? 
Happy birthday! 
Hey, thanks, man. 
You put it in behind the tooth. 
You all right. 
These aren't even on the shelf yet. 
Here. 
Check it out. - Look at that. 
Look at that. - Look at that. It's snowing. 
Ten years old, huh? 
A decade. 
Double digits. 
The big 1 - 0. 
You don't like it? 
- No, no, it's great. 
- You hate it. 
I should've gotten you the Alex alarm clock. 
That's the big seller. 
No, no, no. 
The present's great, really. 
It's just that another year's come and gone and I'm still doing the same old thing. 
" Stand over here. Trot over there. 
Eat some grass. 
Walk back over here." 
- I see your problem. 
- Maybe I should go to law school. 
You just need to break out of that boring routine. 
- How? 
- Throw out the old act. 
Who knows what you'll do. 
Make it up as you go along. Ad lib. 
Improvise. On the fly. 
Boom, boom, boom. - Really? - You know, make it fresh. 
Fresh, huh? 
Okay. 
I could do fresh. 
Works for me. 
Here come the people, Marty. 
I love the people. 
It's fun people fun time! 
Let's go, Gloria! 
Up and at' em. We're open! 
- What day is it? - It's Friday. 
Field trip day. 
Yes, it's field trip day. 
Let's get up and go in ten more minutes. 
Come on! Melman, Melman, Melman! Melman, Melman, Melman! 
Wake up! 
Rise and shine! 
It's another fabulous morning in the Big Apple. 
Let's go. 
- Not for me. 
I'm calling in sick. - What? 
I found another brown spot on my shoulder. 
Right here. 
See? 
Right there. 
You see? Melman, you know it's all in your head. 
Phil! 
Wake up, you filthy monkey. 
Oh, I'm going to be fresh. 
Straight out the ground. 
Tasty fresh! Freshalicious. 
Ziploc fresh. 
Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, the central Park Zoo proudly presents... 
Show them the cat. 
Who's the cat? 
... the king of New York City. - Alex the lion. 
- Alex the lion. 
It's showtime. 
Gather around, people. Big show about to start. 
Check out the zebra taking care of biz. That's right. 
Just smile and wave, boys. 
Smile and wave. 
Kowalski, progress report. 
We're 500 feet from the main sewer line. 
- And the bad news? 
- We've broken our last shovel. 
Right. 
Rico, you're on litter patrol. 
We need shovels. And find more Popsicle sticks. 
We don't want to risk another cave-in. 
And me, Skipper? 
I want you to look cute and cuddly, Private. 
Today we're going to blow this dump. 
Yeah! 
You don't see that on Animal Planet. 
Well, show's over, folks. 
Thanks for coming. 
I hope you thought it was fresh. 
I'll be here all week. 
In fact, I'll be here for my whole life. 
Three hundred and sixty-five days a year, including Christmas, Hanukkah, Halloween, Kwanzaa. 
Please don't forget to never spay or neuter your pets. 
And tip your cabbie, because he's broke. 
You, quadruped. 
Sprechen sie Englisch? 
I sprechen. 
- What continent is this? 
- Manhattan. 
Hoover Dam! 
We're still in New York. 
Abort. Dive! 
Dive! Dive. 
Hey. 
You in the tux. 
Wait a minute. 
What are you guys doing? 
We're digging to Antarctica. 
Ant-who-tica? 
Can you keep a secret, my monochromatic friend? 
Do you ever see any penguins running free around New York City? 
Of course not. 
We don't belong here. It's just not natural. 
This is all some kind of whacked-out conspiracy. 
We're going to the wide-open spaces ofAntarctica. 
To the wild. 
The wild? 
You could actually go there? 
That sounds great. 
Hey, hold up. 
Where is this place? 
Tell me where it is. 
You didn't see anything. 
- Right? 
- Yes, sir. 
I'm sorry. 
No, sir. 
For his final appearance of the day, the king of New York City. 
Thank you. 
Thank you very much. 
You guys are great. 
You're a great crowd. 
Give yourselves a hand. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. Well. Thank you. 
Underpants! 
This is the life. 
That's the spot. 
I'm in heaven. 
- It's Marty's birthday. 
- Just rip it open. 
- What is it? 
- Come on. 
Open it up. 
What you got? 
A thermometer. 
Thanks. 
I love it, Melman. I love it. 
I wanted to give you something personal. 
That was my first rectal thermometer. - Mother... 
Happy birthday to you 
You live in a zoo 
You look like a monkey 
And you smell like one too 
I say. 
Well, now, you guys are just embarrassing me. 
And yourselves. 
What? 
We worked on that all week. 
Let's go. Let's make a wish, babycakes. 
- What'd you wish for? - Nope. 
Can't tell you that. 
Come on. Tell. 
No siree. I'm telling you, it's bad luck. 
You want some bad luck, I'll blab it out. 
But if you want to be safe, I'll keep my mouth shut. 
Would you just tell us? What could happen? 
Okay. 
I wished I could go to the wild! 
The wild? 
I told you it was bad luck. 
The wild? 
Are you nuts? 
That is the worst idea I've ever heard. 
It's unsanitary. 
The penguins are going. So why can't I? 
The penguins are psychotic. 
Come on. Just imagine going back to nature. 
Back to your roots. Clean air, wide-open spaces! 
I hear there's wide-open spaces in Connecticut. - Connecticut? 
- You got to go over to Grand Central. 
Then you got to take the Metro-North train... 
So one could take the train? 
Just hypothetically. 
Come on. 
What would Connecticut have to offer us? 
- Lyme disease. 
- Thank you, Melman. 
No, I just want... 
There's none of this in the wild. 
This is a highly refined type of food thing that you do not find in the wild. 
You ever thought there might be more to life than steak, Alex? 
He didn't mean that, baby. 
No, no, no. 
Doesn't it bother you guys that you don't know anything about life outside this zoo? 
Nuh-uh. 
Nope. Well, I mean, come on. That's just one subject. 
You got a little schmutz right there on your... 
Thanks, guys. 
Thanks for the party. 
It was great. 
Really. 
What's eating him? 
Maybe you should talk to him. 
Go over and give him a little pep talk. 
Hey, I already gave him a snow globe. I can't top that. 
I can see where this is going. 
It is getting late. 
I guess I'm going to... 
Come on. He's your best friend. All right, all right. 
Okay. 
- Night, Marty. 
- Night, Glo. 
What a day. 
I mean, I tell you, it just doesn't get any better than this, you know? 
It just did. 
Even the star's out. 
Not going to find a star like that in the wild. 
Helicopter. 
Marty. Buddy. 
Listen. 
Everybody has days when they think the grass might be greener somewhere else. 
Alex. Look at me. 
I'm ten years old. My life is half over. 
And I don't even know if I'm black with white stripes or white with black stripes. 
Marty. I'm thinking of a song. 
Alex. Please. Not now. 
It's a wonderful song. 
I think you're familiar with it. 
Oh, no. 
I'm not listening. 
Start spreadin' the news I don't know you. 
I'm leaving today We are a great big part of it He's funny. 
Come on. You know you know the words. 
Two little words. 
New York. 
New York 
Shut up, shut up, shut up! 
Hey, I'm sleeping here! 
We're not all nocturnal, you know! 
I'll knock your" turnal" right off, pal. 
Yeah, you and what army, stripes? 
You mess with him, you mess with me, Howard. 
- You're a bigmouth lion. - See? 
Mr Grumpy Stripes. 
We make a great team, the two of us. 
We sure do. 
No doubt about it. 
So, what are you going to do? 
Go running off to the wild by yourself? - No. 
- Good. 
You and me. 
Let's go. 
- What? 
- The wild. 
Come on. You and me together. 
It's a straight shot down Fifth Avenue to Grand Central. 
We'll grab a train, we'll head north. 
We can be back by morning. No one will ever know. You're joking. 
Right? 
Yeah. 
I'm joking. Of course I'm joking. 
Give me a break. 
Like we're going to get a train. 
Don't do that. You really had me worried there. 
Oh, well. I guess I'll hit the sack. 
Yeah, me too. 
I'll need to rest my voice for tomorrow. 
It's Seniors' Day, you know. 
Have to roar extra loud. 
Give them a little jolt. 
Good night, AllyAl. 
They forgot to turn off the ambience again. Don't worry. 
It's cool. 
You know, I got it. 
Much better. 
Come on, now, baby. 
My little filet. 
My little filet mignon with a little fat around the edges. I like that. 
I like a little fat on my steak. My sweet, juicy steak. You are a rare delicacy. 
Alex. 
Alex. 
Alex! 
What? 
What? 
You suck your thumb? 
What is it, Melman? 
You know how I have that bladder infection and I have to get up every two hours? 
I got up to pee and looked over at Marty's pen, which I usually don't do. 
I don't know why, but I did. And... What? 
What's going on? It's Marty. 
He's gone. 
Gone! 
What do you mean," gone"? 
How long has he been working on this? 
Marty! 
Marty! 
He wouldn't fit down there. Marty? 
Marty! 
Marty! 
This doesn't make any sense. 
Where would he go? 
- Connecticut! - He wouldn't. 
Oh, no! 
What are we going to do? 
I mean, we got to call somebody! 
Hello? 
Get me Missing Animals. 
And hurry. 
We've got a lost zebra probably on the way to Connecticut, and we need... 
- Hello? 
Hello? - Wait a second. 
- We can't call the people. 
They'll be really mad. 
It'll get Marty transferred for good. 
Don't bite the hand that feeds you. I know that's right. 
- We got to go after him. 
- Go after him? 
He's not thinking straight. 
Let's stop him from making the biggest mistake of his life. 
He's probably out there lost and cold, confused. 
Poor little guy. 
Come on. 
One of us should wait here in case he comes back. 
Not now. 
This is an intervention. We all got to go. 
What's the fastest way to Grand Central? 
- You should take Lexington. 
- Melman! 
- Okay." We." We should take Lexington. 
- What about Park? 
No, Park goes two ways. You can't time the lights. 
I heard Tom Wolfe is speaking at Lincoln Centre. 
Well, of course we're going to throw poo at him. 
We should've taken Park. 
You sure this is the fastest way to Grand Central Station? 
I don't know! That's what Melman said. Hey. 
Hey, you, guys. 
That room has some nifty little sinks you can wash up in, and look! 
Free mints! 
This isn't a field trip. 
This is an urgent mission to save Marty from throwing his life away. 
Now, where's the train? 
Here it comes. 
What did Marty say to you? 
I asked you to talk to him. I did! 
I did! 
I don't understand. 
He said," Let's go." 
I said," Are you crazy?" He says," I'm ten years old." 
And he has black-and-white stripes, and so then we sang and... 
What you got to do is go straight back down West 42nd. 
- It's on your left after Vanderbilt. - Okay. 
If you hit the Chrysler Building, you've gone too far. 
Thanks a lot, officer. 
Hey! 
Wait for the light. Freak. 
- Did you say" zebra"? 
- That's right. 
A zebra. Right in front of me. 
- Can I shoot it? - Negative. 
Then I'm going to need some backup. 
- Knicks lost again. - What are you going to do? 
Did that say" Grand Central Station" or" my aunt's constipation"? 
This is it. 
Grand Central Station. 
It's grand and it's central. 
We have an emergency here. This is an emergency situation. 
Hey, hey. 
Just chill out. 
It's not that big of an emergency. 
How do you like that? 
Lady! What is wrong with you? 
Get a grip on yourselves, people. 
You're a bad kitty. 
Dagnabbit! I missed the express. 
Looks like I'll have to take the Stamford local. 
I got him! I've got him! 
He's got him! 
He's got him! 
He's got him! He's got... 
I got something for you! 
I'm okay. I'm okay. Whoa! 
What are you guys doing here? 
- I am so glad we found you. - We were so worried about you. 
Don't worry, I'm fine, I'm fine. 
Look at me. I'm fine. 
You're fine? 
Oh, he's fine. 
Oh, great. 
You hear that? Marty's fine. 
That's good to know. 
Because I was wondering... 
How could you do this to us? 
I thought we were your friends! 
What's the big deal? 
I was coming back. 
Don't ever do this again. Do you hear me? 
- Do you hear him? 
- Guys, we're running out of time. 
Oh, Melman, you broke their clock? ... do this again! 
Don't you ever, ever do this again! 
Come here. 
We've been ratted out, boys. 
Cute and cuddly, boys. Cute and cuddly. 
If you have any poo, fling it now. 
It's the Man. 
Good evening, officers. No. No. 
No. You don't talk now. Okay? 
You're not good with the" putting words together " and their coming out good" thing. 
You keep it" shh." Hey! 
How you doing? 
You know what? 
Everything's cool. We just had a little situation here. 
Little internal situation. 
My friend went a little crazy. 
Happens to everybody. 
The city gets to us all. 
Went a little cuckoo in the head. 
Don't be calling me cuckoo in the head. 
Just shush! 
I will handle this. 
I got him! Go, go, go! 
Would you give a guy a break? 
We'll take my little friend home and forget this ever happened. All right? 
No harm, no foul, right? 
Hey, it's cool. 
It's me, Alex the lion. 
From the zoo. 
What's the matter with them? 
I feel really, really weird. 
I love you guys. 
I love you so much. 
Last night's dramatic incident in Grand central is an example of what animal rights wackos have been shouting for years : 
Animals clearly don't belong in captivity. 
They are to be sent back to their natural habitat, where they will live their lives in the freedom they desire. 
Little help? 
- He's awake! 
He's awake! 
Oh, man. 
Oh, my head. 
Wait. Where? 
What? 
I'm in a box! 
Oh, no. 
No, no! 
Not the box. 
Oh, no, they can't transfer me. Not me! 
Oh, I can't breathe. I can't breathe. 
Darkness creeping in. 
I can't breathe. 
I can't breathe. 
Walls closing in around me. 
So alone. So alone. - Alex! 
Alex, are you there? 
- Marty? - Yeah! 
Talk to me, buddy. 
- Oh, Marty! 
You're here! 
- What's going on? 
You okay? 
- This doesn't look good. 
- Alex, Marty, is that you? 
- Gloria! 
- You're here too! 
- I am loving the sound of your voice. 
- What is going on? 
- We're all in crates. Oh, no! 
- Sleeping just knocks me out. 
- Melman! 
Is that Melman? 
- Are you okay? 
- Yeah. No, I'm fine. 
I often doze off while I'm getting an MRI. - You're not getting an MRI. 
- CAT scan? 
No CAT scan. 
It's a transfer. 
It's a zoo transfer. Zoo transfer? 
Oh, no. 
No, no, I can't be transferred. 
I have an appointment with Dr Goldberg at 5 : 00. 
There are prescriptions that have to be filled. 
No other zoo could afford my medical care. 
And I am not going HMO. 
Take it easy, Melman. It's going to be okay. 
- We are going to be okizay. - No, we're not going to be okizay. 
Now, because of you, we're ruined! 
Because of me? 
I fail to see how this is my fault. 
- You're kidding, right, Marty? 
- You. You ticked off the people. 
You bit the hand, Marty. You bit the hand. 
" I don't know who I am. 
" I got to go find myself in the wild." Oh, please. 
I did not ask you to come after me, did I? 
He does have a point. 
I did say we should stay at the zoo, but you guys... 
Melman, just shut it. 
You suggested this idea to him in the first place. 
- Leave Melman out of this. - Thank you, Gloria. 
Besides, it's not my fault that we were transferred. 
Melman, shut it. 
Does anybody feel nauseous? 
- I feel nauseous. 
- Melman, you always feel nauseous. 
Progress report. 
It's an older code, Skipper. I can't make it out. 
You, higher mammal. 
Can you read? No. 
Phil can read, though. Phil. 
Ship to Kenya. 
Wildlife preserve. Africa! Africa? 
That ain't going to fly. 
Rico. 
I was the star in the greatest city on Earth. - Guys, listen. 
- A king. Loved by my people. 
- Let's be civil. 
- And you've ruined everything! 
" Loved"? 
If the people loved you, it's only because they didn't know the real you! 
Don't make me come up there. I'll whoop both of y'all. 
I thought I knew the real you! 
Your black-and-white stripes, they cancel each other out. 
Stop it, stop it, stop it! 
You're not helping the situation. 
Status. 
It's no good. 
I don't know the codes. 
Don't give me excuses. 
Give me results! 
Navigation. 
All right. Let me think. 
And shut him up! 
- I did it! 
- Let's get this tin can turned around. 
Guys? 
Gloria! Melman! 
Marty! 
Alex! 
Marty? 
Alex! 
Marty! 
No, wait. 
Come back, Marty! 
Don't go. 
Marty? 
Melman? 
Gloria? 
Marty? 
Melman? 
Gloria? 
Marty! 
Melman! 
Gloria! 
Hey, anyone! Hello! 
Marty, Melman, Gloria. 
Gloria, Melman, Marty. Marty, Gelman, Gloria. 
Marty, Melman. Morty, Morty, Gelman. Regis. 
Get me out of this thing. Somebody. Hello? 
Get me out of this thing right now! Hello? 
Somebody? 
Melman! 
Alex? 
Is that you? 
Melman, I got you. 
Hang on! Hang on. I got you. 
Melman! I got you, buddy. 
Wait a sec, Melman. 
Wait right there. 
- What are you doing? 
- I'm getting you out of the box. 
- Relax. - Alex? 
Giraffe, corner pocket! 
Here goes nothing! 
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. 
- Hold still! 
- Wait, Alex. 
- Hold still. 
- No, come on. 
- Here I come! 
Look! Look! 
Look! 
Look! 
It's Gloria. 
It's Gloria! 
Oh, hey, it is Gloria. 
Gloria! 
Alrighty, boys, fun's over. 
Gloria! 
Alex! 
- Marty? - Marty! 
Yeah! 
I don't have anything on me right now. I'll have to get you later. 
To you too. 
Marty! Marty! 
Alex! 
Marty! 
Oh, sugar, honey, ice tea. 
Martin! - Hold up! 
- I'm going to kill you! 
- Come here! 
Oh, look at us. 
We're all here together. Safe and sound. 
Yeah, here we are. 
Where exactly is" here"? 
- San Diego. 
- San Diego? 
White sandy beaches, cleverly simulated natural environment, wide-open enclosures. 
I'm telling you, this could be the San Diego Zoo. 
Complete with fake rocks. 
Wow, that looks real. 
San Diego? 
What could be worse than San Diego? I don't know. 
This place is crackalacking! 
Oh, I could hang here. I could hang here. 
- I'll kill you! - Take it easy! 
- Strangle you! 
- Calm down. 
Then bury you, dig you up, clone you and kill your clones. 
- 20-second timeout. 
- I'll never talk to you again. 
We're just going to find the people, get checked in and have this mess straightened out. Now, look. 
Oh, great. This is just great. San Diego. 
Now I'll have to compete with Shamu and his smug little grin. 
I can't top that. Can't top it. 
I'm ruined! I'm done. 
I'm out of the business. 
It's your fault, Marty! 
You've ruined me. 
Come on, Alex. 
Do you honestly think I intended all of this to happen? 
You want me to say that I'm sorry? Is that what you want? 
Okay, I'm... 
He just shushed me. 
Marty, look, you've got to be just a little bit more und... 
- Don't you shush me. 
- Do you hear that? 
Don't you hear that? 
- I hear it now. 
- Where there's music, there's people. - Go to the head honcho. 
- A sidewalk would be nice. 
Yeah, what a dump. 
They should call it the San Di-lame-o Zoo. 
First they tell you," We got this great open plan thing. 
Let animals run wild." 
Next thing, flowers in your hair, everybody's hugging everybody. 
This place kind of grows on you. This way, guys! 
Come on! 
Okay, let's make a good impression on the people. 
Smiles, everyone. Let's get it together. 
- Is that the best you can do? - Oh, I'm not smiling. 
It's gas. Well, great. 
Let's make gas look good. 
- It's not people. 
It's animals. 
California animals. Dude. 
This is like a Puffy party. 
I like to move it, move it I like to move it, move it 
- Ya like to 
- Move it I like to move it, move it I like to move it, move it I like to move it, move it 
- Ya like to 
- Move it I like to move it, move it You like to move it, move it 
She like to move it, move it 
- He like to 
- Move it 
All girls all over the world 
What kind of zoo is this? 
I just saw 26 blatant health code violations. I'm loving San Diego. 
This place is off the chizain. Twenty-seven. 
We should've brought chips and dip. 
Wait. Where's Alex? 
What happened to him? He was right behind us. 
Wasn't he? 
I don't know where he's at, but he's missing one heck of a party. 
The foosa! 
The foosa are attacking! Run for your lives! 
I hate spiderwebs. 
Yeah, thanks a lot, guys. 
Thanks for waiting up. 
Really appreciate it. 
We just got in from New York, and we're looking for a supervisor. 
Because we've been sitting on that beach back there for hours, and nobody's even bothered to show up. 
I don't know how things are normally run around here, but there's been some sort of major screwup, which is cool. 
So if you could point us towards the administrative offices, we'll... 
Well, howdy-do. 
Spider on my back! 
- Maurice, did you see that? - He scared the foosa away. 
Get it! 
Get it! 
- That's it! 
- Get it, get it! Whip it! Whip it good! 
Where'd it go? 
King Julien, what are they? 
What are they? 
They are aliens. 
Savage aliens from the savage future. 
They've come to kill us. 
And take our women. 
And our precious metals. 
Get up, Mort. 
Do not be near the king's feet, okay? 
We're hiding. 
Be quiet, everyone. Including me. 
Who's making that noise? 
Oh, it's me again. 
Get it! Come on, Gloria! 
- Enough! 
Enough with the stick. 
- I think she got it. 
Is it still on me? 
I hate spiders. It's okay. 
It's gone. 
They are savages. 
Tonight we die. 
The feet. 
I told you... I told you to... 
I told every... Didn't I tell him about the feet? 
He did tell you about the feet. 
- Wait. 
I have a plan. 
- Really? 
I have devised a cunning test to see whether these are savage killers. 
Hi there. 
You let me handle it. 
Alex handles it. 
Marty does nothing. 
Hi there. 
Oh, jeez. Sorry. 
- Oh, Alex, what'd you do? 
- Stop. Stop. It's okay. 
It's okay. 
I'm just a silly... Just a silly lion. 
- Alex! - Oh, you poor little baby. Did that big mean lion scare you? 
He did? 
He's a big, bad old puddy tat, isn't he? 
Come on. Mama'll hold you. 
They are so cute from a reasonable distance. 
Aren't you the sweetest little thing. I just want to dunk him in my coffee. 
They're just a bunch of pansies. 
I don't know. 
There's something about that one with the crazy hairdo that I find suspicious. 
Nonsense, Maurice. 
Come on, everybody. 
Let's go and meet the pansies! 
Presenting your royal highness, our illustrious King Julien XIII, self-proclaimed lord of the lemurs, et cetera. 
Hooray, everybody. 
He's got style. 
What is he, like, king of the guinea pigs? 
I think it's a squirrel. 
Welcome, giant pansies. 
Please feel free to bask in my glow. 
- Definitely a squirrel. - Yep. 
Squirrel. 
We thank you with enormous gratitude for chasing away the foosa. 
- The" whossa"? 
- The foosa. 
They annoy us by trespassing, interrupting our parties 
- and ripping our limbs off. 
- Good. 
We're just trying to find out where the people are, so... 
What big teeth you have. 
Man! 
Shame on you, Maurice. 
Can you not see that you have insulted the freak? 
You must tell me, who the heck are you? 
I'm Alex. The Alex. 
And this is Gloria, Marty and Melman. 
And just where are you giants from? 
We're from New York and... 
- All hail the New York giants! 
- New York giants! 
Is this some sort of inbreeding programme? 
I say we just got to ask these bozos where the people are. 
Excuse me. We bozos have the people, of course. 
Hey, the bozos have the people. 
Oh, well, great. 
Phew. 
Don't you love the people? 
Not a very lively bunch, though. 
So do you have any live people? 
No. 
Only dead ones. 
I mean, if we had a lot of live people here, it wouldn't be called the wild, would it? 
- The wild? 
- Whoa. 
Hold up there a second, fuzzbucket. You mean, like, the" live in a mud hut, wipe yourself with a leaf" type wild? 
- Who wipes? 
Oy vey! Could you excuse me for a moment? 
Get me out of here! 
We got to get out of here! 
- Help! 
- What are you doing? I'm swimming back to New York. 
I know my chances are slim, but I have to try! 
- You can't swim! 
- I said my chances are slim! 
Nature! It's all over me! 
Get it off! 
I can't see! 
I can't see! 
I can see! 
Look. There's obviously just been a little mistake. 
The people didn't dump us here on purpose. 
As soon as they realise what happened, they'll come looking for us, right? 
I don't know the words But we're born free 
You know something? 
Well, boys, it's going to be ice-cold sushi for breakfast. 
Rico. 
Well, since I'm doomed to die on this forsaken island, 
I, Melman Mankiewicz, being of sound mind and unsound body, have divided my estate equally among the three of you. 
Sorry, Alex. 
Hey! A latrine. 
Nice work, Melman. 
Outdoor plumbing. No, it's not a latrine. 
It's a grave. You sent Melman to his grave. Are you happy? 
Come on. 
This isn't the end. This is a whole new beginning. 
This could be the best that's happened. No. 
No. No. No. 
No. No. No. 
This is not the best thing that's happened to us. 
You abused the power of the birthday wish and brought bad luck on all of us. 
Why'd you tell your wish? 
You're not supposed to. 
I didn't want to tell you. 
Remember? - You guys made me tell you. 
- Oh, okay. Besides, this isn't bad luck. This is good luck. 
Look around. 
There's no fences, no schedules. This place is beautiful. 
Baby, we were born... Okay. Okay. 
I've had enough of this. This is your side of the island, and this is our side of the island. 
That is the bad side, where you can prance and skip like a magical pixie horse and do whatever the heck you want. 
This is the good side for those who love New York and care about going home. 
- Come on. 
- No, no. 
Back! 
Back! You know what? This isn't good. 
Okay! 
You all have your side, and I'll have mine. 
And if you need me, I'll be over here, on the fun side of the island, having a good old time. 
This is the fun side, where we'll have a great time surviving until we go home. 
- A yabbadabbado old time! 
- This side's the best. 
That side stinks! 
You're on the Jersey side of this cesspool! 
- Wilma! - Now what do we do? 
Don't worry. I have a plan to get us rescued. 
Can't wait to see the look on Marty's face when he sees this. 
Just look at him. He's helpless without us. 
Shut up, Spalding. 
I've been standing here for hours, man. 
How long do I have to pose like this? 
She is finito. 
I defy any rescue boat within a million miles to miss this baby. 
When the moment is right, we will ignite the beacon of liberty and be rescued from this awful nightmare! 
What do you think? 
Pretty cool, huh? - How's the liberty fire going, Melman? 
- Great. 
Idiot. 
I heard that. Why can't we just borrow some of Marty's fire? 
That's wild fire. 
We're not using wild fire on Lady Liberty. 
- Now, rub, Melman. 
- I've been doing... I can't. 
I can't. 
I can't do it. 
I ju... I can't do it! 
Fire. 
Fire! 
Fire! 
Oh, my. Fire! 
Not yet! No, no! 
No! 
Jump! 
Alex, jump! 
Don't worry, cats always land on their... 
Face? 
Man, what kind of cat are you? 
You maniac! 
You burnt it up! 
Darn you! 
Darn you all to heck! 
Can we go to the fun side now? 
Everybody, calm down. 
Come on. 
Everybody, calm down. 
Separate those two, would you, please? You here, you there. 
Everyone... 
Calm down, people, okay? 
Now, presenting your royal highness, the illustrious blah, blah, blah. 
You know, et cetera, et cetera. 
Let's go. 
Now, everybody, we all have great curiosity about our guests, the New York giants. 
- Yes, Willie? 
- I like them. 
I like them. 
I liked them first. Before I even met them I liked them. 
I liked them right away. 
You hate them compared to how much I like them. 
Oh, shut up. 
Now, for as long as we can remember, we have been attacked and eaten by the dreaded foosa. 
The foosa! 
The foosa are attacking! 
It's a cookbook! 
It's a cookbook! 
Please. Maurice. 
Quiet! 
Come on, y'all. They're not attacking us this very instant. 
So my genius plan is this : 
We will make the New York giants our friends and keep them close. 
Then, with Mr Alex protecting us, we will be safe and never have to worry about the dreaded foosa ever again. 
I thought of that. 
I thought of that. 
Yes. 
Me. 
I did. Hold on, everybody. Hold on. 
I'm just thinking now. 
I mean, does anyone wonder why the foosa were so scared of Mr Alex? 
I mean, maybe we should be scared too. 
What if Mr Alex is even worse than the foosa? 
I tell you, that dude just gives me the heebiedabajeebies. 
Maurice, you did not raise your hand. 
Therefore, your heinous comment will be stricken from the record. 
Does anyone else have the heebie-jeebies? 
No? 
Good. So shut up. 
When the New York giants wake up, we will make sure that they wake up in paradise. 
Now, who would like a cookie? 
Yo, Al. Melman and Gloria are over there having a good time. 
There's room on the fun side for one more. 
No, thanks. 
Look, I've been thinking. 
Maybe if you gave this place a chance, 
I don't know, you might even enjoy yourself. 
Marty, I'm tired. 
I'm hungry. 
I just want to go home. 
Could you just give it a chance? 
Think about it. 
it really isn't the fun side without you. 
- It's him. 
- Who is it? 
It's the pizza man. Who the heck do you think it is? 
Yes? 
Can I help you? 
Can I come to the fun side? 
Beg your pardon? 
You know, I've been kind of a jerk. 
But I've been thinking about what you said, and I'm sorry. 
Welcome to Casa del Wild. 
Take a load off. 
Hey, hey, wipe your feet. 
- Alex! 
- Mi casa is su casa. 
Very impressive. 
Hey, have a drink. It's on the house. 
This is seawater. 
Oh, you don't swallow it. 
It's just temporary till the plumbing's done. 
Hey, y'all look hungry. 
How would you like some of nature's goodness? 
You have food? 
The Fun Side Special, coming up. 
Seaweed on a stick. 
Seaweed? 
On a stick. 
Don't love it till you try it. 
- So good. 
- Well, thanks. 
It does kind of hit the spot, doesn't it? 
Well, maybe it could use a little lemon. 
No, it's great. 
It's really great. 
Doesn't get any better than this. 
Oh, but it does. 
Check this out. 
Wow. 
Would you look at that. 
It's like billions and billions of helicopters. 
It's a shooting star. 
Make a wish. Quick! 
How about a thick, juicy steak? 
You know what, Alex? 
I promise you I'm going to find you a steak tomorrow if it kills me. 
Thanks, Marty. 
It is getting late. 
I guess I'm going to... 
I think I'm going to hit the sack too. 
Sweet dreams, everyone. 
Alex. 
What are you doing? 
Twenty-seven, 28, 29. 
Thirty black and only 29 white. 
Looks like you're black with white stripes after all. 
Dilemma solved. 
You see, Maurice, Mr Alex was grooming his friend. 
He is clearly a tender, loving thing. 
How can you have the heebie-jeebies for Mr Alex? 
Look at him. 
He's so cute and plushy. 
I don't think he was grooming him. 
Look more like he was tasting him to me. 
Suit yourself, no matter. I don't care. 
Soon we will put my excellent plan to action. 
All we have to do is wait until they are deep in their sleep. 
How long is this going to take? 
Well, this sucks! 
Wake up, Mr Alex. 
Rise and shining. 
Wakey-waking, Mr Alex! 
Wake up! 
Alex! You suck your thumb? 
What the heck is going on? 
What do you think? Take it easy. 
- Who built a forest? - Don't be alarmed, giant freaks. 
While you were asleep, we simply took you to our little corner of heaven. 
Welcome to Madagascar. 
- Mada-who-ah? 
- What? No, not whooha. 
Ascar. 
Marty. 
It's... 
Just like my mural back at the zoo. 
Oh, no, fella, that is the real deal right there. 
Look at that, that's not a bad view. 
That's the thing that you were always looking at, but it's actually there. 
- That's the real version of... 
- How about once around the park? 
Let's get our blood pumping, lungs breathing this fresh air. 
Who's with me? 
Naw. I don't think I could... 
You're it! 
Hey! 
Want to play around? 
Got you there! 
You're it. Hey, stop that! 
Hey, you're crazy! 
Okay, Marty, I'm it. 
I'm it. I'm it. You win. 
Come on, Alex, get in the groove. 
I haven't eaten in two days. 
My blood sugar's real low. 
I just don't have the energy. 
I don't think that's your problem. 
First of all, that's not how you run in the wild. 
Let's go. 
Put the rubber to the road! 
You just have to let out that inner lion. 
- Now, who's the cat? 
- Marty, I really don't... 
You are, that's who. 
Come on! 
Here we go! 
That's it. Let's build up some steam! 
You the cat. 
- Who's the cat? 
- You the cat. 
Who's the cat? 
Who's the cat? 
Who's the cat? 
I'm the cat! 
Surprise! 
You're it. 
You're it! 
Can't juke the cat. 
Cat's too quick. 
- Let's go wild! 
- Now you're talking! 
Man! 
I feel different. 
Kind of charged up or something. 
- Like you said, baby, it's... 
- Crackalacking. 
- Ain't that right, Melman? - Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. 
I'm in heaven. 
You see, Maurice, Alex is now our friend and the foosas are nowhere to be seen. 
It could be said that my plan is working in a very good working kind of way. 
Alex. You got to try some of this. 
I feel good. 
Feel like a king again. 
King? 
You should see his act. 
Come on, Alex, why don't you show him some of your act? 
Oh. No, I really don't think I could... 
Okay. 
Ladies and gentlemen. Primates of all ages. 
The wild proudly presents : The king. Alex the lion! 
E flat, fellas. 
Yeah! 
The king is in the house! 
See, if he is the king, then where is his crown? I've got a crown. 
Got a very nice one. 
And it's here on my head. 
Do the roar, man. Do the roar. 
Wow. 
I've never heard that one before. 
Yeah! Go wild, man! Come on! 
Break out the wave! 
Excuse me. You're biting my butt. 
- No, I'm not. 
- Yes, you are. 
- What did you do? 
- You just bit me! 
No. 
I didn't. 
Did I? - You kind of did. 
- He just bit me on the butt! 
What the heck is wrong with you? 
Why'd you bite me? 
- Man, it's because you are his dinner. - What? 
- Excuse me? 
- That's dumb. 
Come, come, Maurice. 
What is a simple bite on the buttocks among friends? 
Here, give me a nibble. The party is over, Julien. 
Your brilliant plan has failed. 
What are you talking about? 
Your friend here is what we call a deluxe-model hunting and eating machine. 
And he eats steak, which is you. 
- Get out of here. 
- Okey-dokey, Maurice, I admit it. 
The plan failed. All is lost! 
We're all doomed. 
The foosas will come back and gobble us with their mouths because we are all steak. 
I'm steak! Me, me, me! 
Mr Alex cannot stay here. 
He belongs with his own kind on the foosa side of the island. 
By the power vested in me, by the law of the jungle, blah, blah, blah, blah... 
- Be gone! 
- What? 
Come on, do I look like a steak to you? 
Yeah! 
See, I told you I don't look like a... 
Wait. What you say? Oh, yeah! 
- He's going savage. 
- Run for your lives. 
Marty, run! 
- A bull's eye. 
Excellent shot, Maurice. 
- Thank you. 
Marty? 
I'm so sorry, Marty. 
What is wrong with me? 
Oh, no. 
What have I done? 
It's true. 
I'm a monster. I got to get out of here. 
What have I done? 
This is a nightmare. 
And it's all my fault. 
Now, because of me, we've lost Alex. 
Well, what are we going to do? 
We'll find a way to help him. That's what we'll do. 
Come on, we are New Yorkers, right? 
We're tough. 
We're gritty. 
We're adaptable! 
And we are not going to lay down like a bunch of Melmans. 
No, we're not. 
Oh. Gloria. 
That was not me, okay? 
That was the boat. 
- The boat! 
- The boat? 
The boat's come back for us! 
Come on, guys, we got to flag it down. 
There it is! 
- Hey, over here! 
Melman, give me a lift. 
Hurry up! Lift me up! Help! 
Help! 
Help! 
- Oh, my neck. 
My neck. You guys. 
Look! It's turning! It's coming back! 
It's coming back! 
Come on! 
Come on, baby! 
You flag down that boat. I'll get Alex. 
Hold on there. 
You cannot go back there by yourself. 
Come on. 
I know Alex. 
He hears we're rescued, he'll snap right out of it. 
The people are coming. They can help us. 
Melman's right. 
The people will know what to do. 
Now, we got to flag down that boat. 
Now, this is more like it. 
You? Oh, ma... 
Where are the people? 
We killed them and ate their livers. 
Got you, didn't I? 
Just kidding, doll, the people are fine. 
They're on a slow lifeboat to China. 
Hey, I know you two. 
Where's that psychotic lion and our monochromatic friend? 
Marty? He's righ... 
Where did he go? 
He was right behind us. 
He went back for Alex. 
He's going to get himself killed! 
Well, boys, our monochromatic friend's in danger. 
Looks like we have a job to do. 
Captain's log : Embarking into hostile environment. 
Kowalski. We'll need to win the hearts and the minds of the natives. Rico. 
We'll need special tactical equipment. 
We're going to face extreme peril. 
Private probably won't survive. 
Alex! Come out, Alex! 
The boat's here! We can go home! 
Alex! 
Alex! 
Marty? 
Snap out of it, Alex. 
The boat came back. 
We can get out of here. 
We can go back to civilisation, and everything will be like it used to be. 
Stay back. 
Please. 
I'm a monster. 
Alex, you're no monster. 
You're my friend. 
We're a team. You and me, remember? 
I don't want to hurt you. 
Alex. I ain't leaving without you. 
Alex? I'm thinking of a song. 
It's a wonderful song. 
I'm sure you're familiar with it. 
Come on, you know the words. 
Two little words. 
Please don't make me sing this by myself. 
You really don't want to hear me sing this by myself. 
Alex? 
Could you come out here for a minute? 
Hey, Alex, a little help. 
Help me! 
Alex! 
Help me! Anybody, help me! 
Somebody! 
- Melman? 
- That's right, baby. 
Run! 
- What's the plan? - This is the plan. 
- Foosa hungry. 
- Foosa eat. This is the plan? 
Foosa halt. 
Ooh. Foosa aaahh. 
Foosa ooh. 
Foosa aaahh. 
Come and get it. 
There's too many of them, Skipper. 
It's been a real pleasure serving with you boys. 
Alex? 
That's my kill. 
Mine. 
Alex hungry. 
Alex eat. 
It's showtime. 
Thanks for not giving up on me. 
Man, you almost gave me a heart attack. 
You can't just come sneak up on me. 
We're getting out of here. 
Guys, just go with me on this. 
Like I said, it's showtime. 
My kill. 
They're all mine. 
It's the king of the beasts! 
Oh, no! - Don't eat me! - He's big and scary! 
- I am far too young to die! - You're a monster! 
A monster, I say! - And, you! 
Oh, you want some of this? You better run for your lives. 
- Somebody call a cop! 
- He's psychotic! 
This is my territory. Understand? 
I never, ever want to see you on my turf again. 
Yeah! 
You the cat! 
I did it! 
Give me some love! 
The plan worked! 
The plan worked! 
I'm very clever! 
I'm the one, baby! 
Come on. Time to robot. 
I am very clever king. 
I am super genius. 
I am robot king of the monkey things. 
- Compute, compute. - So, what's for lunch? 
- Close those eyes. - Why do I have to? 
- Do it. 
- They're closed. 
- Tighter. 
- No peeking. 
- They're closed. 
Rico. 
Open that hatch. 
Fire in the hole. Now chew. 
Chew like you mean it. Savour it. 
- And? 
- Well? 
Pretty good, right? 
There's always Plan B. 
This is better than steak. 
I love it. 
I love it! 
The kitty loves the fishy. 
Well, I propose a toast. 
Now, he may be a pain in the butt at times... 
And trust me, I know. 
But this cat proved to me without a doubt that his heart is bigger than his stomach. 
- To Alex. 
- To Alex. 
Enough! Stop it! 
What do you think? 
Should we head back to New York? 
I don't know. 
I mean, this is your dream. 
You sure you want to leave? 
I don't care where we are. 
As long as we're together, it doesn't matter to me. 
Well, in that case... 
Yo. Rico. 
I'll take 300 orders to go. 
Hai. 
But before you leave, I have an announcement to make. 
So shut up, everyone, please. Thank you. 
After much deep and profound brain things inside my head, 
I have decided to thank you for bringing peace to our home. 
And to make you feel good, I'm going to give you this lovely parting gift. 
No, I couldn't. 
Really, I can't take your crown. 
That's okay, I've got a bigger crown. 
It's got a gecko on it. 
Look at him shake. Go, Stevie, go! 
- Bye, little fuzzbuckets! 
- Thanks for everything! - So long! 
- Bye-bye, now. - Arrivederci. 
- See you later, crocodile. Maurice, my arm is tired. Wave it for me. 
Faster, you naughty little monkey. 
By the time we get back to New York, it'll be the middle of winter. 
So I was just thinking, why rush? 
Maybe we could make a few side stops along the way. 
- Maybe Paris. 
- You just read my mind. - I was thinking Spain. 
- Run with the bulls. 
- What about Fiji? 
- Canada. Can we? 
Cheap meds. 
I wouldn't even mind coming back here sometime. 
- I could do that. - You could say that again. 
- Skipper? 
- I always wanted to go to Australia. 
Don't you think we should tell them that the boat's out of gas? 
Nah. Just smile and wave, boys. Smile and wave. 
Where's Danny? 
I don't know. 
He disappeared just after we took off. 
Here he is. 
Right, listen, it's been fun, hasn't it? 
All right and I'm going to call you just like I promised I said I would. 
How's your head? 
That's all right, I'll call engineering. 
I'll get that soap dispenser... moved down a little bit. 
It's dangerous, could have your eye out. 
Okay, got to go. 
Big kiss. 
There it is, go on. 
- Finished? 
- Yeah, just having a flashback. 
- Ash, get us a car. 
- Right. 
So that's where you disappeared to? 
Well, there's something about trolley dollies. 
It must be all that makeup. 
- Three hours? 
- Oh, no. 
No, the last two, I was flying the plane. 
- Nice place. 
- Start as you mean to go on. 
Mick? 
Look I don't care if he does know the Chancellor... the price is still nine million, non-negotiable. 
Hold. Yes? 
There seems to be some confusion over the reservation. 
- There wasn't one. 
- Janet? 
Well, I called this morning to confirm. 
I'm sure it was just an oversight. 
Our reservations clerk is new. 
So new in fact, she forgot to swipe your credit card. 
And you are? 
I'm the manager. 
- Yes, Nigel? 
- Yes. 
Nigel, I will see to it right away. 
Well, if I could just take it- - 
Excuse me. 
Yes, I'm still here. 
Yes, and the price is still the same. 
Would you hold please? 
Thank you for dealing with this matter personally, I will get right on it. 
Right. 
- Thank you. 
- No problem. 
Okay, let's do what we do best. 
Let me get this straight. 
What you're telling me is... you're going to take my 100,000 in cash... do your little share scam thing... then bring me back half a million, in five days, is that right? 
Guaranteed. But we'll have to be quick. 
Crown Offshore find out that we've manipulated their stock... we'll be dead in the water. 
Come on, think about it, Howard. 
A guaranteed minimum return of 500 %, no risk, no fuss. 
- It sounds fantastic. 
- It is. 
Your competitors will be sick when they find out... how much money you've made on the deal. 
And you're willing to let me in? 
First name on my list. 
Half a mil, one hit. 
- No questions asked. 
- I've got a question. 
Shoot. 
Where on my forehead does it say cash dispenser? 
- I'm not with you. 
- Really? 
Let me spell it out for you, as you're clearly not the sharpest tool in the box. 
You tell me about this great deal you have. 
Guy on the inside, guaranteed returns, blah, blah, blah. 
I give you a grand, you give me four back. 
You with me so far? 
I'll take that as a yes. 
So now I'm three grand up. 
Thank you very much, by the way. 
You're three grand down, but you're hoping that's a good investment. 
Why? 
Because giving me three grand should convince me to give you more. 
Let's call it bait. 
You all right? 
You look a bit peaky. 
Can I get you a drink or something? 
No? 
So. 
Now I give you a suitcase full of money, cash of course. 
After all, I can trust you, can't I? 
You've already made me money. 
Only this time... you disappear. 
Simple. 
Imaginative. 
What could go wrong? 
Okay, that's it. 
Deal's off. 
Clear you don't trust me. 
I suggest we call it a day. 
But my money's here. 
No, I'll find someone who appreciates what I'm offering. 
I appreciate it, really I do. 
Please. Please take my money. 
Do your magic thing one more time. 
Okay, look, you're £ 3,000 to the good. 
Let's just leave things as they are. 
No, let's not. 
Give this to the police. 
Oh, no. 
What kind of welcome's that? 
The kind you get when you disappear without paying your tab. 
We thought you'd be pleased to see us. 
My accountant said I should bar you until you pay up. 
- You've got an accountant? 
- Yes. 
So, you're all barred. 
Okay, Eddie, if that's the way you feel about it. 
- How about one last drink? 
- For old times' sake. 
Okay, one drink. 
Cheers, Eddie, bring them over. 
And put them on our tab. 
We got a lottery winner here. 
If you beat the odds of fourteen million-to-one... you deserve to keep your money. 
Telecommunications boss gets golden handshake. 
Sorry. 
Hello? 
Alice, Alice, Alice! 
God, yeah. Yeah, of course I remember. 
Yeah, mine is, too, it's killing me. 
I can't talk right now, sweetheart,'cause I'm, you know, I'm just about to.... 
I'm just about to go into theater. 
Yeah, all right, I'll definitely call you back. 
Definitely. 
All right, goodbye. 
Bye. 
You're a very sick man, Danny. 
Look at me, surrounded by angels. 
All right, this is your last drink, then you're all barred. 
You really should work on your customer service, Edward. 
- You're almost there. 
- I save that for paying customers. 
I suppose you've heard about Harry. 
- Who? 
- Harry Holmes, one of your lot, ain't he? 
- Old-time grifter. 
- Yeah, he's one of the best. 
What happened, Harry. 
Seems he was taken for 30,000 a few years back. 
He remembered the sequence. 
So he took you for the convincer, and then turned you in? 
How much? 
3,000. 
This is what I don't get, right. 
Why didn't he just pocket your three grand and, you know, let you walk away? 
He loved it, you know? 
Telling me how clever he was. 
Taped every conversation we had, then made a full statement. 
So who is he? 
A young high flier called Howard Jennings. 
He's a property broker. 
He finds land for the major developers to build on. 
Nasty piece of work. 
I really thought I had him. 
He's obsessive, always one step ahead, has files on all his opponents. 
Checks everything out, nothing left to chance. 
A rival company snatched a large parcel of land... from under his nose last month. 
Took a nine iron to his own desk. 
It's like he needs a course in anger management. 
Made worse when they discovered a cache of old Roman coins during excavation. 
Worth a fortune, apparently. 
Made him a laughingstock. 
Sounds like it couldn't happen to a nicer bloke. 
- Do you need anything? - No. 
Thanks, Mickey, but I'm fine. 
I appreciate you coming, though. 
Know it couldn't have been easy. 
Mick, did you have to dress like that when you were inside? 
- Drop it, Danny. 
- It was a joke. 
- A bad one. 
- Sorry, Mick, no offense. 
None taken. 
Listen, right, listen up. 
I say we take this Jennings bloke. 
- We can't. 
- Why not? 
- Tell him, Ash. 
- Well, he's clued up. 
When some realize they've been conned, they get obsessed by it. 
You know, research the subject. 
And if he knows enough to take convincer money off a good grifter like Harry... that's what he's done. 
Which means they can't be taken again. 
First rule of the con... always stay one step ahead of the mark. 
Hang on a minute. 
I thought the first rule of the con was you can't cheat an honest man. 
- It's that, too. 
- Yeah, can he do that, Albert? 
Can he just change the first rule when he wants? 
You can't con someone who knows when they're being conned. 
You're saying, this bloke's too clever for us? 
No, I'm saying we play percentages. 
And if the mark knows the plays, it leaves us nowhere to go. 
Excuse me. 
No, idiot. 
Hello, gorgeous girl. 
Yes, I'm with a patient. 
Who? 
One of the passengers, that's right. 
Yeah, it's the turbulence in the air.... 
Sickness, nightmare. 
All right, yeah, I'll call you, of course. 
Bye. 
Look. 
What's the one thing you've said to me more than anything else? 
Apart from" Shut up, Danny." 
Listen, now, everyone has a way in, all right, everyone's got a weakness. 
Maybe he's the exception that proves the rule. 
Maybe he's not, okay? 
A mark is a mark is a mark... is a mark. 
All right, look, there's no point doing all this Kung Fu, Grassyhopper stuff... 
Mickey, with me, if you're not going to let me put it to the test. 
Danny, the long con is a science. 
It's about reason, covering all the angles, leaving nothing to chance. 
Yeah. 
But it's also about having the bottle to go for it. 
Look any idiot can go for it. 
But a con artist takes the mark's money... and he doesn't even know he's been conned. 
Yeah, okay. 
But isn't it also about gut instinct? 
What's Albert call it? 
What do you call it, Albert? 
Grift sense? 
Most of all it's about not taking unnecessary risks. 
All right. Let's put it out. Let's ask the others. 
Leave me out of it. 
Just pretend I'm not here, all right? 
Thanks a lot. 
Okay. 
Let's let Albert decide. 
Well, on the surface, granted... trying to con Jennings is a bad idea. 
But there's another challenge here. 
Two styles of grifting. 
One reasoned, well thought out, as Mickey says, covering all the angles. 
The other more intuitive... daring, relying on one's ability to think on their feet. 
Which is the best? 
Hard to say. 
They each have merits of their own. 
See? 
I got merits. 
Of course, the true con has elements of both. 
That's it, then, what Albert says. 
It's a challenge. 
What? 
We take the con. 
If it works, I win, and if it don't, you do. 
- You don't think that's a little childish? 
- No, Mickey. No, I don't. Okay? 
50p? 
- What? 
- 50p says that I can take him. 
- 50p. 
- Yeah, cash. 
To con the un-connable mark. 
Of course, if you're too much of a girly wuss, Mickey... a little bit too frightened to take the bet, we'll just leave it right there. 
Okay, superstar. 
You have got yourself a bet. 
So we're actually going to do this? 
Well, it looks like it. 
Yeah. 
Tell them it's non-negotiable. 
I want this loser sent down for whatever the maximum sentence is. 
He played the game, he lost. 
He pays the bill. 
End of. 
Very simple, just think. 
Think it through. 
Look, Danny. 
Why do you always have to go out on a limb, hey? 
I just hear myself saying it, Ash, and then... that's it. I don't know. 
Anyway, I'm in it now. 
Need any help? 
Me, no. 
No, thanks. 
No, I've got it all sussed. 
I'm just really, you know, going through those fine details. 
Details? 
I know what you're thinking. 
Do you? 
You're thinking the most important thing... is to keep him away from the police, right? 
Most marks don't report a con... because they think they've done something illegal... or better still, they don't know they've been conned in the first place. 
Yeah, that's right. 
With Jennings, his reputation is the biggest thing. 
He has to be seen as top dog. 
Brilliant! 
Brilliant. It is.... 
Wow! 
That's like you're in my head. 
You're probably thinking of a way to make him look stupid... if he did go to the police, right? 
Right. 
Something that might ruin his reputation, that sort of thing? 
You know what? 
That is really, really clever. 
Yeah, I scare myself sometimes. 
Okay, I've got it! 
Right, listen up. 
Briefing back here, one hour. 
Don't be late. 
Thank you. 
Let's make it two. 
You see, whatever we do has to be so outrageous... that even if he knows he's being conned, he ain't going to go to the police... because he's going to look a prat. 
Right, I got the idea from Harry. 
You remember he said this Jennings bloke was miffed...'cause that other company found all them gold coins. 
- Yeah, and? 
- And... we sell him a piece of land... but we make him believe there's something under it. 
Such as? 
I read about this museum exhibition- - 
- You read something? 
- Yes, thank you, Stacie. 
I can read. 
Thank you. 
Actually, Irish John told me about it. 
Right. 
The Jubilee collection. 
Gold artifacts dating back to the Bronze Age, found... when they were extending the Jubilee line into the East End. 
Yeah, I heard about that. 
What they couldn't work out was where all the gold came from. 
It suggested that the Bronze Age inhabitants... of what would eventually become London... 
- had a plentiful supply- - 
- Thank you, I was just about to say that. 
Hold on. 
Why couldn't the gold have come from somewhere else? 
There are more likely sites in the Mendips or Wales, but... as the M4 wasn't built for the next 5,000 years, chances are it was mined locally. 
- Gold mine scam- - 
- Hello, thank you. 
- This is my con. 
- Wait a sec. 
We're going to sell this guy a gold mine? 
In Central London? 
Why not? 
This is going to be the easiest 50 pence I've ever earned. 
Okay, yeah, all right. 
But don't spend your money just yet...'cause that is the whole point. 
The more outrageous it is, the less... he's going to see it coming. 
Well, there's a twisted logic in there somewhere. 
No, he's got a point. 
You know, I mean... who'd be stupid enough to try and sell a fake gold mine... in the middle of London? 
There you go. 
Harry told me Jennings reads The Telegraph. 
So we mock up a copy for him. 
Now he must know about the collection, but let's remind him. 
Phase two, the land itself. 
Ash has found us a place. 
15,000 square feet, less than a mile from where the artifacts were found. 
Run as an old rag and bone yard for years. 
Now the old guy- - 
Thank you very much. 
The old man is retiring, so he's willing to sell it to us. 
The agreement is we pay when we find a buyer. 
Okay, I say we sell it to Howard for twice what the land's worth. 
We'll pack the old boy off on holiday to Bognor Regis... so he's going to be out of our hair for two weeks. 
How do we convince the mark about the gold? 
All we got to do is plant the seed. 
Just enough to get him to take a soil test... and then get a gold expert in for evaluation. 
And he, of course, will be one of us. 
What do you think? 
If it had any more holes, you could strain tea with it. 
Let's be honest, mate, you're just frightened of losing the bet. 
Okay. 
So what's first? 
- Ash, what about the office? 
- We'll be set up in a couple of days. 
Right. 
Then that leaves nothing more than for me to reel him in. 
- What? 
- Problem? 
Yes, Albert's the roper. 
That's how this works, we all do our own jobs. 
Albert ropes, Stacie's the banker... 
Ash is our fixer, and you and I play the inside. 
I know that, okay, and no offense, Albert, but we can't do this one by the book. 
If Jennings knows all the moves, we've got to invent new ones. 
No roper steering him to the inside man, no convincer. 
I'm just going to dive straight in. 
Whoosh. 
Whoosh? 
Trust me, he won't know what's hit him. 
What do you think? 
It's a disaster waiting to happen. 
Tell me I'm wrong. 
I can't. 
I think we should keep an eye on him. 
All right. 
Wish me luck. 
Wait, I'll come with you. 
You don't make life easy for yourself, do you, Danny? 
It'll work, Albert, all right. 
It will work, just trust me on it. 
- Anything is possible. 
- What, you think I'm out of my depth? 
Use that talent of yours and surprise us all. 
And remember, your first meeting with a mark is crucial. 
If you get off on the wrong foot... 
- you're beat from the start. 
- Right. 
Cold read him, learn everything you can... before you say a word. 
Cold what? 
You do know about cold reading? 
Oh, cold reading. 
I know about cold reading. Yeah. 
Well, how about a little refresher course? 
If we've got time, I mean.... 
Yes, please. 
It's really very simple. 
Follow me. 
What do you see? 
Okay, right. 
- A bloke. 
- More specific. 
You've got to convince him that you're like-minded, like two peas in a pod... that you could be his friend. 
Now to do that, you need to know who he is. 
To become a chameleon. 
Chameleon? 
His name... is Mark. 
All right, okay, seriously. 
Well he's... 
- he's divorced? 
- There you go. 
Maybe he's not, though. 
He's on a business trip. 
Could be here on the pull. 
- Not enough cologne. 
- Okay. 
What else? 
Divorced. 
He sees his children on the weekends, at fast food restaurants. 
He has to pay a fortune for the maintenance and that's left him... tired and stressed. 
He probably didn't cook before he left home. 
Consequently he's lost weight recently. 
No way. 
I'm not having that. 
Look at his socks. See? 
Children. 
And his nails. 
See the stress? 
His skin. 
That's the fast food, yeah? 
Okay, I'm having all of this, but how you telling me he's lost weight? 
Look at his belt. 
See the line. 
He's pulled it in a notch. 
Mark, how are you? 
Have you lost weight recently? 
How are your lovely children? 
Thanks. 
She's still got the hots for you. 
Is that so? 
What, like you didn't know? 
This is the best crew I've ever had, and I intend to keep it that way. 
And you think hooking up with Stacie would spoil that? 
I know hooking up with Stacie would spoil that. 
Maybe you'd better tell her. 
Guys, it's all about staying one step ahead of the competition. 
- You see what you want and you just- - 
- Go for it. 
It's not" go for it," Nick. It's" get it." 
Yes, I mean, that's what I meant. 
That site I had in Islington. 
83-year-old tenant blocking the deal. 
She wouldn't move because she was worried her little cat... wouldn't find its way home. 
That's wrinklies for you. 
So I ran over the cat, she signed within a fortnight. 
See what you want, grab it by the balls. 
Off you go. 
Glass of shampoo, squire. 
Oh, God, scenery's nice, isn't it? 
Anyone tried to pull yet? 
Nick was just about to try his luck, but he bottled it. 
I told you, she's probably waiting for someone. 
Well, there is only one way to find out. 
50 quid says that I pull it. 
Okay, you're on. 
- Yeah? 
- Yeah. 
All right. Wish me luck. 
Not a chance. 
Hi. 
I'm a bit nervous, listen, don't worry I'm not trying to pull you. 
My boyfriend would kill me. That's a joke. 
All right. 
Seriously, it's my mom's birthday, and I love her, I adore her. 
I suppose what I'm really looking for is a bit of womanly advice. 
Now, don't cry. 
I had a girlfriend and I loved her but she dumped me on holiday. 
That's all right, thank you. 
He seems to be doing all right to me. 
Could've been you. 
- Fifty, weren't it? 
- Pay the man, Nicholas. 
You know what I always say, Nichol-ass? 
You see what you want, you grab it by the balls. 
Tell you what, why don't I buy you all a drink? 
No thanks. 
We have to be getting back. 
- Howard? 
- I think I'll stay for one more. 
- See you back at the office, then. 
- Yeah, see you. 
I hate a bad loser, don't you? 
Absolutely. 
Howard Jennings. 
Paul Carrington. 
He loved it, you know? 
Telling me how clever he was. 
Taped every conversation we had, then made a full statement. 
I really thought I had him. 
Let's just leave things as they are. 
No. 
Let's not. 
So, what do you do? 
Property. 
- Property? 
- Development, mostly. 
I find the land, you know, the boss flogs it to the highest bidder. 
- What's the name of the company? 
- Cityrise. 
You heard of it? 
- No. 
- Based in Manchester. 
Just opened a London office. 
- And how's business? 
- It's okay. 
So who do you work for, then? 
I work for me. 
Now that is my dream. 
Tell old Golden Balls where to stick his job. 
Golden Balls? 
You'll know him soon enough. 
Going to blow away the competition, he says. 
Really? 
Biggest in London in three years, he reckons. 
Anyway, it is time I was off. 
Listen, Howard. 
Can we do this again? 
Yeah, maybe. 
Give my secretary a call. 
Shame. 
How you fixed for tomorrow? 
Really, I'm very busy. 
Nice to meet you though, Paul. 
I tell you what. 
Why don't you swing over now? 
Check out the new offices? 
You can say hello to Golden Balls while you're there. 
- Yeah, all right. 
- Great. 
I'll just ring my secretary, tell her I'm on my way. 
- Dorothy. 
- Dorothy? 
No. 
- We're not set up. 
We said tomorrow. 
- I was losing him.... 
- We have to go now. - Danny! 
There's not enough time. 
Dorothy. Can you hear me? 
- The line's very.... 
- Danny. 
Okay, let's go. 
Excuse me. 
Can I help you? 
Don't tempt me, darling. 
We've come to give the second floor a once over. 
I thought you weren't starting till tomorrow. 
Tomorrow? 
Look. 
You ever done any painting and decorating, sweetheart? 
- A bit. 
- Right, you ever heard of prepping? 
- Well, I.... 
- God bless. 
I tell you what, you can come upstairs with us... and give us both a hand, if you like. 
- I bet you'd look great in a pair of overalls. - I'm sure you'll manage. 
He's with me. 
Hold all my calls. 
Thank you. 
Right, this is the boss's floor, more or less... and here's his office. 
- You're late. 
- Yeah, sorry, business lunch. 
- I brought someone back with me. 
- Yeah, who? 
This is my boss Martin Stuart. 
Martin this is.... 
Howard Jennings. 
So, you're Jennings? 
You've heard of me, then? 
James Harrison is due here in 10 minutes, we'll need his portfolio. 
Well, I'll go and dig it out then, shall I? 
You're about all I have heard since I've been down here. 
That's because this is my city. 
There's not a patch of undeveloped land in London that I don't know about... and have first refusal on. 
If that's true, I guess I'll be out of a job soon. 
You said it. 
Is that what you've come to tell me? 
Pretty much. 
Actually, I doubt we're in competition. 
You buy and sell land, so do I. 
Yes, but mine's more specialized. 
Specialized? 
So if you'll excuse me, I do have some work to be getting on with. 
I'll get Paul to show you out. 
... Harrison's file on my desk now. 
Show Jennings out. 
Howard. 
- Well, it was a pleasure meeting you. 
- Yeah, next time make an appointment. 
You should be ashamed of yourself. 
How did it go? 
It was a piece of cake. 
- We weren't even set up. 
- What? 
- He brought the mark back with him. 
- I had a chance and I grabbed it. 
What if we couldn't have got set up in time? 
Mickey, I had faith in you, didn't I? 
- Where're your socks? 
- Here's one of them. 
Sorry, Danny, but it does seem a bit messy. 
Messy? 
Usually we have it all worked out. 
You know, a proper plan. 
Listen, gang. 
Listen up. 
We have got a plan. 
Okay, we've got a plan. 
All up here. 
You've no idea how frightening that is, have you? 
You just got to trust me, haven't you? 
What next, then? 
Well, I'm working on that one. 
What's the first thing the mark would do? 
Well, he'd.... 
What would you do? 
Right. 
Don't tell me. 
You can almost hear the cogs turning. 
Research Cityrise. 
Ash, please set up a web site. 
I was just about to say that. 
Ash, go and search the thing. 
I was just about to say that, Mickey. 
All right, troops, everyone listen up. 
Tomorrow. 
Ash, get the yard ready. 
Stacie, I want you down the museum. 
Albert, you're our gold expert. 
- Mickey, get yourself off to the bank. 
- What for? 
Get your 50p out. 
Do you ever have the feeling we've created a monster? 
All the time. 
Right. How far away? 
Remarkable examples, aren't they? 
Do you work here? 
I'm in charge of the Bronze Age. 
Well, not the Bronze Age as such, I mean, that's a period of time. 
That would make me a queen, and a time traveler, at that. 
No, I'm actually in charge of the artifacts that hail from the period. 
And these are my crowning glory. 
One of the great mysteries of London. 
It seems a bit far-fetched, that there's a gold mine in London somewhere. 
No, not really. 
The landscape was very different 6,000 years ago, after all. 
No, it's perfectly feasible. 
In actual fact, we have a professor of geology here in the museum... who's writing a paper on it. 
Really? 
Where do I find this professor? 
I'm a philanthropist, I invest in scientific studies. 
In that case, I'm sure he'd be happy to talk to you. 
Let me write down his number. 
It says here the original mine would be worth millions. 
Indeed. 
I doubt what you see here represents even 1 % of what was actually there. 
Of course, the site has almost certainly been built on by now, so... we'll never know, will we? 
I've written my number on the other side. 
Enjoy the rest of your visit. 
The Saxon village reconstruction is excellent. 
You don't think Danny's going to pull this off, do you? 
No. 
But you're letting him try anyway? 
He thinks what we do is easy. 
Won't hurt to bring him down a peg or two. 
And win the bet in the process? 
To the victor the spoils. 
Hello? 
According to my notes, Howard.... 
May I call you Howard? 
Yes. 
It's widely believed that most gold deposits, particularly... of the volcanic and sedimentary variety... were formed from circulating ground waters... driven up by magma. 
But, of course, it could also be expelled from the magma itself as it cooled. 
- And this could happen in London, right? - Oh, yes. 
No reason not, although geologically speaking... 
- conditions aren't ideal. 
- But is it possible? 
Oh, yes, there are certain residues... that have been around for thousands of years. 
And how could you find out if you thought you had land with gold in it? 
A multitude of ways, mostly by a simple soil test. 
Soil test? 
So I could bring you some soil... and you could tell from that whether there was gold underground? 
No, I have to have further tests for that. 
But I could determine that the possibility was there. 
How accurately? 
It depends on the size of the deposit. 
80, 90 %, possibly. 
You hold such a piece of land? 
No, not yet. 
But if I did, would you be prepared to do this test for me? 
Yes, of course. 
If the Museum has no objection... 
I'd be happy to help. 
What you talking about? 
I don't need all this. 
I don't need all this. 
Yes. 
Just do it, all right, do it. 
Cute, isn't it? 
All right, mate, how you doing? 
What's up? 
Basically, Nick doesn't know it yet, but he's leaving us. 
So his job's up for grabs. 
I just thought you might be interested. 
50K a year, double that with your commission... nice car, relocation allowance. 
Lovely. Yeah, I am listening. 
Only trouble is I'm just not sure you're right for it. 
I'm not sure I want to work for you. 
Don't take offense, Paul. 
It's more about what kind of deals you're used to handling. 
I mean, with Martin, what's the biggest deal you're doing? 
Do I look like a Muppet? 
- Pardon? 
- You're just trying to nick all our clients. 
All right, well. 
You can't blame a chap for trying, can you? 
Okay, look, just talk me through one of your deals. 
I mean.... 
Martin was talking about one the other day. 
What was it? 
The Jubilee deal? 
- You know about that? 
- A little. 
So what is it? 
All I know... all I know, is that we've been hired to buy a parcel of land... regardless of price. 
- By who? 
- That I don't know. 
Martin's very secretive about it. 
Which usually means that he wants to take all the credit. 
Do you know where the land is? 
It's owned by an old rag and bone merchant. 
We've offered him twice what it's worth in cash, but he ain't having any of it. 
Cash? 
Yes, he hates banks. 
It's a shithole. 
That's what I don't get. 
I mean, look at it. 
Barely going to get two houses in there, are you? 
I mean, it ain't that far from the Jubilee line, granted. 
But, I don't know, the boss seems very keen to pay way over the odds for it. 
Right, can you get me in to see the owner? 
What's in it for me? 
The job we discussed earlier. 
No. 
Look. 
I don't know what you're up to, all right. 
I don't know, I don't care. 
But, you cut me in and then maybe, you know... maybe I'll suddenly start thinking about it. 
I like you, Paul, you remind me of me. 
So? 
Yeah, you've got yourself a deal. 
Set up a meeting. 
... all I know, is that we've been hired to buy a parcel of land... regardless of price. 
... regardless of price. 
- Got to you the other day, didn't it? 
- What? 
- Going to see Harry in prison. 
- Yeah, a little. 
In which case, you've got a problem. 
You know this is going to go pear shaped, don't you? 
The kid's gone off 100 miles an hour. 
Little or no groundwork, no convincer, no Plan B. 
Come on, give him credit, he's played it well so far. 
Come on, Mick. 
You know as well as I do. 
There's a huge gulf between setting up a long con... and actually walking away clean. 
I know. 
Which means you've got a decision to make. 
Which is? 
If it's going down the pan, do you bail him out? 
Or do you let him fail, to teach him a lesson and win the bet? 
Even if that means you going back to prison. 
Hello. 
Howard. 
Yeah, the land's worth 210. 
I think Martin's latest offer was 420. 
Yeah. 450 should do it. 
Okay. What time? 
Yeah, that's fine, I'll be there. 
All right, bye. 
We're on. 
Hello? 
Mr. Jennings. 
Yes, hi. 
At 10 : 30. 
And the address? 
Right. I'll be there. 
Bye. 
Hello? 
Howard? 
Okay, sure. 
No problem. 
And the address? 
Fine. 
That's weird. 
Why does he want everyone there? 
Well, I told you, didn't I? 
He's a control freak. 
Okay. No problem. 
Ash. Go get set up. 
Better get your 50p ready. 
- Right, you set? 
- Yeah. 
Okay, 10 minutes. 
This doesn't feel good. 
It's Danny's call. 
Howard. 
How are you? 
Thought I'd better bring some security. 
There's a lot of money in here. 
All right, lads, welcome. 
Here he is, Colin. 
This is the man I was telling you about. 
Mr. Jennings. 
This is Colin Nash. 
I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Nash. 
You look like a man who's prepared to drive a hard bargain. 
Yeah, rats. 
- Really? 
- I ain't got long. 
A man after my own heart. 
He tells me you're willing to beat the other bloke's offer. 
Indeed, yes, there's a contract here. 
And the money's in here. 
In cash. 
I understand you don't like banks. 
No, leeches. 
I couldn't agree more. 
So how much you got in there, then? 
£ 450,000. 
It's time. 
Be careful. 
So, do we have a deal? 
Absolutely. 
Just one condition. 
That I carry out a soil test. 
Soil test? 
It's company policy. 
Thank you for coming. 
- I'm not exactly sure why I'm here. 
- Who are they? 
They'll be carrying out the tests. 
No one said nothing about no soil test. 
No soil test, no deal. 
Yeah, well hurry up, then, like I said... 
I ain't got all day. 
I've got everything I need here, it wouldn't take long. 
In your own time. 
I don't get it. 
What exactly are you looking for? 
You'll see. 
Well? 
Are you sure? 
Definite traces of gold. 
It's my belief there was an underground stream here at some point... skirting the main source and bringing the particles up to the surface. 
See? 
Excellent. 
- So do we have a deal? 
- It would seem so. 
Just one more bridge to cross and then we can sign. 
What bridge? 
Okay. 
Howard, if you're messing me about, I'll go. 
The thing is, Paul... it occurred to me this might all be part of some elaborate con. 
- Con? 
- Surely you've heard of a confidence trick. 
For example, say you were all part of the same gang? 
How would I know? 
I haven't met any of you until this week. 
So for me to part with a briefcase full of cash... to people I've known for less than a week... would be pretty stupid, wouldn't it? 
And I'm not. Stupid, that is. 
So I thought I'd better get some insurance. 
You see, the Professor has just told me there are gold deposits here. 
Gold? 
That's right, yes, your boss was very secretive, wasn't he? 
Although you knew where the land was and how much he'd offered. 
So now I do my own tests. 
And if they don't find anything... five minutes after you've assured me there was gold... then I'd have to assume you were about to con me. 
No one leave. 
When they don't find gold, I've got a feeling he's going to be very pissed off. 
So if you tell me which way you're going to run... 
I can make sure we don't bump into each other. 
Shit. 
- I really hope Danny's got a Plan B. 
- And C. 
What's all this, then? 
Won't take long. 
- Vermin. 
- Are you quite finished? 
Have to burn them. 
Hey, what the bloody hell's all this? 
Do you know I thought you might make an appearance. 
Paul? 
This is my deal. 
- You have no idea what you're doing. 
- Look. 
Mr. Jennings has topped your offer, it's been accepted. 
Get over it. 
You're fired. 
You just happened to be passing, I take it? 
No. 
I wasn't just passing. 
Dorothy told me he was here. 
We've done the deal. 
I'm here to make another offer. 
Mr. Nash, now, I have another offer that I really think you should consider. 
Boss. 
Okay. 
We're screwed. 
I take it he got Albert to do a test first. 
How did you know that? 
That's the only way he'll know for certain if it's a con. 
So what are we going to do? 
Looks like you've got yourself a deal, Mr. Nash. 
If you could sign there. 
Thank you very much, Mr. Nash. 
Looks like you've been pipped at the post, Golden Balls. 
Sorry about all that other stuff, but you never know who to trust. 
Paul, about the job. 
I've decided to keep Nick on after all. 
Sorry. 
Can someone explain to me what just happened? 
- He found gold. 
- How? 
Well I guess the Jubilee site had to be somewhere. 
But that means this place could be worth millions... and we just flogged it to him for a poxy 450K. 
You win some, you lose some. 
That was intense. 
Let's get out of here. 
I just still don't get it. 
It would have been a terrible, terrible thing. 
But.... 
Strangely.... 
My sex life would have been a terrible thing. 
Do you know I could get used to this. 
A quiet Danny. 
Silence is golden. 
Having a good laugh, are you? 
Everybody having a good laugh? 
Okay, where's my 50p? 
And I want a letter. 
- A letter? 
- Yes, I want a letter signed by you... apologizing for underestimating me and stating uncategorically... that I'm the better grifter. 
You lot can witness it. 
Eddie, paper on the bar, squire. 
Thank you. 
I'd happily do that, Danny. 
If you'd won the bet. 
- Did we sell the land or not? 
- Yes. 
- Yeah, is the money in the case or not? 
- Yes. 
Yeah, then pay up. 
No, but the bet was which is the best style... your unstructured, undisciplined, fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants... let's-all-go-to-jail madness masquerading as a long con... or my professional, reasoned, covering - all-the-angles, never-get-caught style. 
Bollocks. 
- And that's your argument, is it? 
- No, my argument is the con worked... 
- and you should pay up. 
- But the con was falling apart. 
We still got paid. 
But only because I was watching your back. 
- What? 
- Tell him Ash. 
No, you leave me out of this. 
You hadn't covered all the angles, so I had to do it for you. 
How did you do that? 
I didn't hear you say a word. 
I didn't have to. 
- You remember Ash firing his gun? 
- Yeah. 
He didn't actually shoot anything. 
- All right, so the rat died of a heart attack. 
- Actually... it was one I prepared earlier. 
- What do you mean? 
- He simply fired into the ground. 
Why? 
Because he'd filled the cartridges with gold. 
All he had to do was aim at the spot where the sample was about to be taken... and fire, peppering the soil with gold. 
- So there weren't any gold? 
- No. 
Only what we put there. 
Sorry, only what I put there to cover your ass. 
Experience, science, Danny. 
Covering all the angles. 
Not going off half-cocked. 
So I win the bet. 
Yeah, well.... 
Whatever. 
Call it a draw, all right? 
No, now wait a minute... if I hadn't bailed you out, the whole thing would have gone pear shaped. 
If it weren't for me, we wouldn't have been there in the first place. 
- You owe me 50p. 
Pay up. 
- No, no you pay up. 
- But I won. 
- No, you didn't win. 
You didn't win. 
We made a case full of money because of me. 
No, because of me, you mean. 
- What about the web site? 
- I was going to do that. 
I arranged for Albert to give you a lesson in cold reading. 
What, cold reading? 
I knew that stuff already. 
No, you did not. 
Looks like it's going to be a long night. 
Yes, shall we leave them to it? 
Why don't you just admit it, I beat you fair and square? 
Why don't you just admit it, all right? 
You were going to walk away, I made us a case full of money. 
- I do hate sore losers. 
- Do you? 
Double or quits. 
- What? 
- I've got this great idea. 
- Oh, no. 
- No, bear with me. 
Pigeons. 
- Pigeons? 
- Pigeons, yeah. 
Pigeons. I read all about them. 
They're worth a fortune. 
Can you paint a pigeon? 
- I'm not even listening. 
- No.' Cause you know I'm right. 
Shut up, Danny. 
God made a garden for Man and Woman and he told them... 
'" Do not eat of the fruit from that tree.'" 
A serpent visited the Woman and offered her an apple from the tree. 
He told her the apple would give her knowledge. 
He was very persuasive... and Mankind has been paying the price ever since. 
All because we were tempted by something we didn't need. 
The serpent was the first grifter. 
Yo, Terry, what's going on? 
It's Chazz again. 
'Ere what, yeah. 
I need those flaming boxes delivered this afternoon, drey. 
You can do that for me, just put them all in the van, yeah? 
Yeah, that'll be great. 
Yeah, Terry, gotta put you on hold, it's my mom on the other line. 
Probably her hip again. 
One sec. 
Mr. Hyotona, konnichiwa. 
Yes, the artifact is with me now. 
Of course you can see it but time is of the essence. 
I'm expecting a consignment of Italian lithographs... all arriving this afternoon in identical boxes, unmarked of course. 
Mr. Emmerick's phone. 
Mr. Jensen, I'll put you right through. 
Yes, Mr. Hyotona, I'll have to place you on hold. 
It's my Madrid dealer. 
Mr. Jensen. 
I'm afraid there's another interested party. 
Well, an original, illuminated, 6th century transcript... of the Pentateuchal books of the Bible is bound to generate a lot of buzz. 
You've seen the Photostats? 
Some of these pictures put even the Book of Kells to shame. 
What's that? 
You haven't seen them? 
My associate, Professor Jackson, isn't with you? 
Ash, where is Professor sodding Jackson? 
Albert hasn't shown. 
I can't raise him. 
I'm sure there's a very good reason why he's not with you. 
Albert's not turned up. 
One moment please, Mr. Jensen, my PA has just walked in. 
What do you mean he's not turned up? 
He ain't there, okay? 
He's a no-show, Mickey. 
The street is an Albert-free zone. 
For the poor? 
Are you troubled, my son? 
I think I saw the future today. 
God sometimes gives us glimpses of the path we are traveling. 
I always thought I knew just where I was headed. 
Truth is, Sister... now I'm not so sure. 
Do not despair. 
There is always hope. 
I don't mean to split hairs, Sister, but I don't believe in hope exactly. 
I prefer to call it chance. 
And a chance has to be grabbed. 
What's your problem, my son? 
I'm not a churchgoer, Father. 
The wife's a big fan, though. 
She told me to light a candle to Saint Marie of the Incarnation. 
I'll bend the knee to any statue you like. 
But you have got to help me. 
Albie. 
We were worried. 
What are you, my nurse? 
I'm fine. 
Look, there's bad news and there's good news. 
When you didn't show, the marks lost their bottle. 
So you've had the bad, then. 
- Where the hell were you? 
- We were worried. 
Albie, if you want to go off-piste, at least let the rest of us know. 
This one has always been a no-no. 
I've had a bad feeling from the off. 
Okay, so what's the good news? 
Johnny Keyes. 
Keyes. 
Oh, yeah. 
I know him. 
Proper hard man. 
Proper East End, he is. 
I thought he was a chef. 
'" The Kitchen King.'" Yeah, my missus had that book. 
So you saw a fancy chef in a church. 
Whoopee diddley doo! 
No. 
I saw a powerful, arrogant thug. 
With cash in his pockets and desperation in his eyes. 
What's he got to be desperate about? 
He grew up on the streets, robbing houses, talking with his fists. 
Yeah, not to mention turning over a couple of banks. 
And he did time for that. 
A lot of time. 
Some say they should have thrown away the key. 
This man was evil personified. 
Inside I was just like the rest of them. 
A nobody. 
I did kitchen detail just to pass the time at first. 
But then it got into my blood. 
And I was devouring books. 
Hungry to learn. 
Cooking for the big men. 
So he gets out of prison and buys a restaurant with a bag of gold bullion. 
- And now of course, he runs K's. 
- K's. 
Who do you have to kill to get a table in there these days? 
He said it's in case I get a puncture. 
So why is he desperate? 
What most people have forgotten is the story of James. 
His son. 
In 1974, his one-year-old son was kidnapped. 
Never to be heard or seen again. 
I had a lot of enemies in those days. 
But I'll never know which bastard took him. 
I couldn't pay what they wanted. 
I didn't have the ransom, all right? 
I've got to find him. 
Before it's too late. 
Keyes is sick. 
A bum ticker. He wants to find his heir before they stick him in the ground. 
James would be 32 now. 
So you're talking birthrights... inheritance, that's your angle, is it? 
Sorry, but stinging some guy who's still grieving over his long lost son? 
Don't shed one tear for him, my dear. 
The guy's a nasty piece of work. 
I got a feeling in my bones that he's close. 
I got money for him. 
Plenty to help him make something of himself, the way I did. 
If I could give him the money... least then I'd feel I'd done something for him. 
Now what? 
I think we should reunite him with his long lost son. 
Albert. 
What the hell were you doing in a church today? 
Gil Stewart died this afternoon. 
I was there at the end. 
Oh, God. 
I'm so sorry, Albert. 
You two were like brothers. 
We worked Vegas together. 
That man was made for bright lights. 
Poor bastard. 
Died of a stroke in a dental surgery. 
Well, someone should sue them. 
He was pretending to be the dentist. 
Before he died... he gave me this. 
His wedding ring. 
All those years of hard grift... and he dies holding a bottle of plaque remover. 
When I die, Mickey... 
I want my pockets to be filled with cash. 
Let's take Keyes' money, Michael. 
So. 
How do you feel about playing the prodigal son then? 
Well? 
Stacie, find out as much as possible about Keyes'past. 
The details will help convince him that Danny is his son. 
These old articles talk about a vicious armed robber... into everything from extortion to protection rackets. 
But once Keyes gets out of jail, he reinvents himself. 
Suddenly he's about as dangerous as Delia Smith. 
Well, I reckon she's got a dark side. 
Salmon nibble? 
One theory is that he swindled some of his old compadres out of money. 
The kidnap was revenge. 
Okay. 
So how do we usually get a mark? 
We appeal to their greed. 
This bloke's not looking to make money, is he? 
He's looking to give it away. 
So we spin him a sob story. 
Will that be enough? 
You see giving Danny the money has to be his idea. 
What you got in there? 
Got luncheon meat. 
Obviously. 
- That's on the turn. 
- Yeah, that's how I like it. 
Who's Albert with? 
- His new best friends. 
- Oh, yeah. 
Yeah, bunch of cab drivers he met this morning. 
Three jacks. 
- Happens to the best of them. 
- Yeah. It does. 
Four kings. 
You lose, old-timer. 
- Go again? 
- Soon. I hope. 
So, he's had a few, then? 
Yeah. He's been here a while. 
A rose in a bed of thorns. 
We keep away from blokes on a hot streak unless we got another deck up our sleeve. 
Albert? 
Look, mate, gambling's not going to bring Gil back. 
Have you called Keyes yet? 
No, I don't wish to make a reservation. 
I wish to speak to Mr. Keyes. 
Yeah, Father O'Brien. 
Of course there's nothing like a wine tasting en primeur. 
I've just come back from a chateau in Burgundy. 
Top stuff. 
No. 
Of course, it's all bloody show. 
Still. 
I'm a sucker for the grape. 
Who'd you say you were again? 
Chris. 
I run Family Ties. 
We help reunite estranged families. 
I don't know anything about wine. 
Only about 200 people in this country do. 
Sammy here accounts for about three of them. 
So the priest sent you, then? 
He called us about three years ago. 
Trying to locate his real family. 
I'm talking about James. 
Your son. 
I know this is difficult, but please believe me when I say- - 
There's no way. 
The priest makes one call and finds my son just like that? 
All right. 
Call us when you're ready. 
Hello, is that Jobseekers? 
Yes, I'm wondering if you could help me. 
I'm looking for some enthusiastic... candidates with a very good telephone manner. 
James has been in and out of foster homes since he was three. 
He was illegally sold to a childless couple... who had a change of heart and abandoned him. 
He should have been identified as your son, but unfortunately he wasn't. 
I don't buy that you've found him. 
He found you, Mr. Keyes. 
Quite some time ago. 
He didn't know if you'd want to see him. 
But when Father O'Brien called us... that's when James knew. 
I'll be in touch. 
I hope this brief role-play has given you some idea... of the environment you'd be expected to work in. 
Mr. Starkey will hand out questionnaires. 
Please hand them back as you leave. 
And we'll be in touch with the lucky two we've chosen in due course. 
Thank you for your time. 
What is that? 
Don't look in the cupboard. 
Is it gonna jump out? 
- Jesus! 
- I warned you. 
What do you think the air freshener's are for? 
Albie. 
Nobody's going to the funeral. 
But, Gil would have loved this. 
He's being buried under the name of Benedict Doonan. 
Died a dentist. 
Buried a dentist. 
So he doesn't get his own name on his headstone? 
- Bummer. 
- What does it matter? 
Who's gonna be there to cry for him? 
What's eating Gilbert Grape? 
Well, he won't admit it, but it's grief. 
Hello, Chris speaking. 
Yeah, no that's no trouble at all. 
We can get that arranged. 
Yeah. 
Okay, cheers. 
That was Keyes' lawyer. 
They want a blood test. 
Organ courier. 
Theater. 
Which floor? 
Your contact is? 
Contact sheet's back in my panniers. 
I wasn't told of a transplant. 
Yeah, well sorry, love, but seeing as you're not doing the operation... maybe they didn't make you a priority. 
Which floor? 
- I'm afraid I can't let you through until- - 
- Right. Okay. 
There's a fella upstairs the same color as a canary and he's waiting for one of these. 
On a slab. On a drip. 
Cut open. With a little machine doing the job of his liver for him. 
You want to ask him if he minds hanging on a bit while I go and get my clipboard? 
Thank you. 
Staff. 
Excellent. 
I'll need someone available to take a blood sample for me in about half an hour. 
Get me three chairs and an internal phone... and coffee, three sugars if you can. 
The doctor... is in. 
Dr. Reef. 
Yes, he phoned to let us know. 
- First floor and follow the signs. 
- Cheers. 
This is all rather unorthodox. 
Protocol is to send these results in the post. 
But since you insist on knowing now. 
Let's have it. 
We compared the DNA from your sample to that of James Haworth. 
The relative chance of paternity is 99.99 %. 
So James.... 
It is as beyond doubt as it can be. 
He is your son, Mr. Keyes. 
I want a second opinion. 
I'm sorry? 
I want it reconfirmed. 
Now. 
- Well, you can see the results. 
- It's the way I do things. 
You get another doctor in. 
Now. 
Well, I'm not sure I can just pull a colleague off the corridor. 
If it'll put Mr. Keyes' mind at rest, Doctor. 
Very well. 
Do you want a cup of something? 
He's been ages. 
He's made a cock-up. 
I knew this wasn't right. 
Yeah, think I agree. 
What, we're going? 
Well, it's not doing you any good pacing up and down here. 
Besides, they can always send the second opinion in the post. 
- Do you really think we should go? 
- It's your call. 
You're in the driving seat. 
I'm here to unite people not alienate them. 
Five more minutes. 
Okay. 
This is Dr. Mansfield. 
Dr. Mansfield, I will show you these two DNA results. 
Your assessment, please. 
99.99 % match, Doctor. 
- They're related? 
- Yes. 
I need a drink. 
You did very well. 
- So am I a doctor now? 
- Definitely. 
Do I get to do operations? 
I'd like to operate on a heart, or an eye, or a lung. 
Steady, these pre-meds can really give you the wobbles. 
Or a brain. 
Yeah, let's get you back to bed. 
God, the things I do for you guys. 
- You look cute. 
- Yeah, you look fantastic. 
Juliette Keyes. 
She's on to her third husband. 
She'll want to know what you're after financially. 
Yeah, but the blood test confirms it, doesn't it? 
I'm his son. 
But still, I'll be there to stage-manage. 
- Okay, you look great, let's go eat. 
- Just looking. 
Thank you. 
It's okay, come on. 
Right. 
This is James. 
Jimmy. 
Everyone calls me Jimmy. 
And this is Jimmy's missus-to-be, Paula. 
This is an amazing place. 
Isn't it amazing, Jimmy? 
Yeah. It's amazing. 
I'm Juliette. 
Handsome devil isn't he, Johnny. 
So you found us all right, then? 
Yeah. 
Well, it took a few years. 
The important thing... at this very early stage is not to worry about any doubts or fears or anything. 
Just, you know, be patient. 
It's an amazing place, this. 
You got to keep ahead in the restaurant game. 
Customers will eat the food, but when it comes to other chefs, it's dog eat dog. 
Cost us everything, this place. 
It's amazing. 
Keep the menus brief, that's the trick. 
People want to be told what to eat. 
So what are you cooking, Jimmy? 
Well, I'm just at Burger Chef right now. 
But I've done stints in some fancy places, ain't I? 
- Yeah. 
- Lamb and apple tatties. 
That's one of mine, with a spicy fig sauce. 
Saffron, roasties. 
You don't want to get too fancy. 
Simple food tells its own story... providing it's sauced right. 
Try that. 
Don't dawdle, know your mind, Jimmy. 
Are you taking the piss out of me with this chowder? 
On second thoughts, have you put the piss in the chowder? 
So. 
You're mad about your food, Jimmy. 
But have you got what it takes? 
No, I am dreadfully sorry, sir. 
Yeah, but l- - 
Sir, shouting at the maitre d' doesn't alter the fact that there is... a four-week waiting list for Sunday lunch. 
Goodbye. 
Some people. 
- Wow, four weeks? 
- Eight weeks for a Saturday night. 
We always keep a couple of tables on stand-by for those last minute celebs. 
What you doing out here on your lonesome? 
Two's company, a social worker's a crowd. 
We're not being wound up, are we, Chris? 
He isn't a gold-digger, is he? 
Because we've had someone try it on before. 
- No, Jimmy's for real. 
- Well, he'd better be. 
Or knowing Johnny, God help him. 
Makes no odds how much you pay for your Chateaubriand... the bins still stink. 
Yeah, I suppose so. 
I'm going to put a visible wine cellar out here, behind a glass partition. 
Beautiful thing, a good cellar. 
Sounds fantastic... 
Mr. Keyes. 
Call me Johnny, at least. 
So. 
You want to open a gastro-pub. 
Well, that's the plan. 
I mean, that's a long way off. 
So did Mom suffer much before she died? 
Your mom? 
No. 
It was quick. 
The cancer was all through her. 
We were separated by then. 
The family didn't let me go to the hospital. 
Just the funeral. 
Bastards. 
I wasn't angry. 
I didn't cry. 
When you come from nowhere you learn pride. 
No weakness, yeah? 
Look. 
Tomorrow night. 
In here. 
A family party. 
Come on, yes or no. 
What's the matter? 
Yeah, all right, then. 
Yeah, tomorrow. 
I tell you now, if he could, he'd hand me the whole business on a plate today. 
- I don't think so. 
- What are you talking about? 
There's a connection but there's no bond. 
You need to bond, Danny. 
What? 
Why don't you give him a kiss? 
Oh, yes. 
Eddie's aunt's attic. 
Hasn't been cleaned since Everton won the FA Cup. 
Killer cobwebs. 
Sticky, with those little bits of grit. 
It's very nice, yeah. 
We need to beef Danny up. 
Book a table at K's for tomorrow night. 
Eight-week waiting list. 
Problem? 
Nope. 
Hey, guys. 
Guys, you wouldn't be interested in having your picture snapped... with Justin Timberlake, would you? 
Yeah, I got the nod he's eating at K's, and the pics always look better... with a little bit of a crowd, you know? 
Go on. 
Off you go. 
Go on quickly. 
We love Justin! Off you go. 
Come on. 
Just around the corner. Go quickly. 
Will you please leave right now! 
I don't want to have.... 
Listen to me, I don't want to call the police. 
Excuse me. 
When I book a table I ask for discretion to the max. 
Why do you think Mr. Timberlake is choosing to dine out of the West End? 
- I don't understand. 
- Justin Timberlake, you moron. 
He's not in the book. 
I can check with Ms. Keyes. 
No, Justin doesn't do books. 
He comes in under the wire. 
Not under my wire, sir. 
I'll tell you what we'll do, then. 
Don't get the table ready. 
Instead we'll wait in the foyer here with the adoring hordes... so you can explain it all to Justin and his people when he arrives. 
Just doesn't look good for a place like this, does it? 
Well, I can assure you, sir, this publicity leak had nothing to do with us. 
The hard-core ones pick it up off the fan sites. 
What can you do? 
I'll take the table and tell Justin's driver to delay for an hour. 
Justin's a regular guy. He'll understand. 
Nothing by a window, no place settings facing west. 
Lead on. 
Who is he and why has he got a table for four on his own? 
All right. 
Look after him. 
But tell the kitchens to check his face against the wanted list. 
- What's a" wanted list"? 
- We have photos in the kitchen... so the staff can spot the restaurant critics and the Michelin inspectors. 
It helps the monkeys know who the hunters are. 
So why waste your life frying burgers, Jimmy? 
Well, it's regular bunce, isn't it? You know. 
We got a wedding to think about, haven't we. 
Sod that. 
What about your pride? 
Sparkling water with a twist of lime, and can you get this butter softened? 
It's like a slab of ice. 
So where you gonna get the money for this gastro-pub? 
Well... 
- once the banks know they can trust us- - 
Crooks with pens in their pockets. 
Trust me, I know. 
Well, how else are we gonna get the capital? 
- You can't let them run you. - Waiter. 
The split-pea soup's watery and the Neuf-du-Pape... at least two degrees above ambient temperature. 
Do you have any idea.... 
Forget it, just bring my lamb casserole. 
Don't tell me you've lost your nerve after yesterday. 
So how'd you two meet? 
- We just got chatting in a bar. 
- Surprised he had the nerve. 
- Well, how'd you mean? 
- He's a cracking boy, but he's shy. 
Some people ain't suited for the cut and thrust. 
You! 
Here. 
Now. 
This lamb tastes like boiled dog. 
Get rid of it. 
Johnny Keyes. 
There's a problem? 
My God, were you born with such perception or did you learn it from... 
- some ancient Chinese master? 
- lf you're dissatisfied- - 
I'm a major player in the entertainment world and I know a lot of critics. 
- Excuse me. 
- One word from me and this place... 
Wait. No, Jimmy, don't. 
... will be on the receiving end of a review with three of my favorite words : 
" nauseating,"" heinous," and" putrid." 
If you don't shut up, it's not the food that you're gonna be complaining about. 
Call off the whelp. 
Unless you want this dump black-listed by the likes of Beyonce. 
Johnny Keyes built this place up from nothing. 
People like you only have a talent for pissing on other people's hard work. 
Well go on, mate. 
Go and get your friend, go and write your review. 
And then wait to see the letter that lands on your doorstep... which will have my three favorite words : 
" libelous,"" unsubstantiated"... and" court-case." 
" Court case" is two words. 
Yeah, well I used a bloody hyphen! 
I don't know who you are. 
But you just made a big mistake. 
No, he didn't. Now make like one. 
And I'll tell you who he is. 
He's my son. My long lost son. 
Champagne for everyone! 
My son is home. 
Yes. 
Monkey to see me, old-timer. 
You have cleaned me out. 
Here. 
It's real silver. 
Come on, Jimmy. 
Let's get a drink. 
He wants us to stay the night. 
So? 
Where am I gonna sleep? 
Who'd you think you are, Sister Wendy? 
You're gonna be sleeping with me, sweetie. 
Fine. 
So long as you remember there's a no-fly zone. 
Laugh at his jokes. 
Drink his drinks. 
Just to keep being a chip off the old block for Keyes. 
Come on, Chris, mate. 
What's going on? 
Well, he's saying he thinks that we should go. 
I just think it's too much, too soon. 
How can it be too much? 
I've missed out on the last 32 years. 
Stay. 
First one to get the picture card... gets the bed. 
You all right? 
Yeah. 
St. Balthazar. 
Patron saint of card players. 
I should've lit a candle to him before I took on that cabbie again. 
The bloke's on hot streak. 
I told you, stay away or load the deck. 
Yeah. 
Tell me, is Danny making a good son? 
Yeah, perfect son. 
Do you ever wish that you had kids, Ash? 
Well, it's the life we sign up for, isn't it? 
What about you? 
The way Mickey talks to Danny reminds me of the way I used to talk to Mickey. 
Yeah, I know. 
You know there's a horrible point in your life when you realize... that you've got nothing to teach the younger ones... except through your mistakes. 
- But when I die- - 
- No, don't start. 
No, when I die, I'm gonna die rich. 
And I don't want any eulogies... or tears. 
I just want people to say," There lies Albert Stroller. 
" He couldn't take it with him. 
" But by thunder... 
You can cheat anyone out of anything. 
I think you'll cheat Death and live forever. 
Don't be flippant. 
I'll still be chasing the cons when I fall off my perch. 
You're gambling too much. 
- Don't do it to yourself, mate. 
- Shut up and leave me alone. 
Gil was your friend and you miss him, I know- - 
I said leave me alone! 
That's probably Keyes... thinking about us... doing it. 
We shouldn't disappoint him then, should we? 
I mean I am supposed to be a chip off the old block. 
Danny. 
Yeah, I'm thinking that's a very good point. 
- I gotta close the deal. 
- No. 
Yeah, I'm gonna close the deal. 
Paula, do you think we should? 
Okay, then, you're insatiable, ain't you? 
I love it when you make those noises. 
Night, then. 
Good night. 
I want to give you two some money. 
Mr. Bombastic has done it again. 
Danny. 
If I could speak to you right now across this table... 
- what would I advise you to do? - Give it a break. 
Can we stop playing Jedi master for two minutes? 
Okay, it's working just dandy andy pandy. 
He's offering. 
I should accept. 
And what about her? 
You never wanted his charity, Danny. 
No, because you have your pride. 
You want to make it on your own. 
And that's why you're going to turn his offer down. 
- Just like we agreed, Danny. 
- All right, then. 
Now why don't you ask me... what you're gagging to ask me? 
No, I don't have to. 
I know you two were faking last night. 
Why? 
It's a common mistake. 
But no one has that good a time of it. 
I made a judgment call, and I lost you. 
It haunts me, Jimmy. 
I can't make up for the last 32 years but I can help you now. 
I want to invest in your future. 
Darling, don't you think we should talk about this later? 
You know I want to make it on my own. 
Yeah, Jimmy's right. 
We want to carve a life on our own terms. 
Our way. 
What about this, then? 
I come over to your place and you cook me your pièce de résistance. 
Cook for you? 
And if your foods good enough, then I'll invest. 
- You'll come won't you, sweetheart? 
- I've got a pedicure. 
And I'll be tough on you. 
'Cause I know that's what you want. 
Look at that face. 
He loves the idea. 
Tomorrow at 5 : 00. 
Your place. 
My place? 
Great, yeah, my place. 
There's a lot of light. 
But I expect you guys provide your own. 
What's it called again? 
Zombie Towers. 
Block of flats. 
That's the gateway to Hell. 
Now I don't think there's enough room to run a dolly in here. 
Hell, I may just have to ride that bad boy on the crane. 
Come up here through the window. 
Boom. 
Now Mr. Eaves, we're wrestling a very tight budget. 
One month's lease is still going to cost you two grand. 
Let me crunch you some figures. 
The net cost of the picture is 2.2 mil. 
U.S. studio will pick up North American rights for 3 mil. 
A consortium will handle domestic and European... and a third party's gonna take care of DVD and cable. 
So we're looking to clear about 5 mil before box office. 
So you would think that we have money to burn. 
But, alas, no. 
The entire budget of this baby is deferred against back-end profit. 
It's still two grand. 
Take it or leave it. 
I like you. 
You got cojones. 
You should be producing pictures instead of this faggot. 
How would you like to be in one? 
I thought you were kidding when you mentioned it earlier. 
You be here 11 a.m., on the 14th, and you... are in the movie, Mr. Eaves. No. 
We'll give you tickets to the premiere... and all your pals can come along and see you up on the big screen... as one of the undead. 
But, in return you waive the rent until the movie is in profit. 
It's called a" satisfactory deferment." 
As zombie roles go, it's great. 
You get to eat Amanda Donohoe. 
Thank you. 
Cheese. 
So you tie your filo parcels with the spinach strands. 
And then you? 
Then you drop them in oil. 
That's searing hot oil, Danny. 
Searing hot oil. 
- You know this means a lot to him. 
- What? 
I mean a lot to him. 
He thinks he's found his only son. 
He's a bully and he loves himself. 
He bounced back once, he'll do it again. 
Hot oil. 
Show me the pheasant. 
Pheasant, come on. 
- Danny, that should have infused. 
- Infuse. 
- Yeah, infuse the pheasant. 
- Yeah, what's that say? 
- I got it, haven't I. Already put infused. 
- All right, fine. 
Good. 
All right. 
Which sauce do I use? 
All of them. 
- You don't think that's too much? 
- No, trust me. 
It'll do the job perfectly. 
Remember to infuse the pheasant. 
Ash, we're getting tight for time. 
How's it coming along? 
It'll be a lot quicker if you didn't keep phoning me. 
All right? 
This is going to be close. 
You going to the Wilson's party and all? 
No. 
I'm visiting my son, Jimmy. 
Jimmy and Paula? 
Top floor? 
- Streuth, you'd best get climbing. 
- Third floor. 
Jimmy Haworth? 
Those your directions? 
Oh yeah, it's not 301, it's 901. 
That's their old address. 
Don't I know you? 
Your voice, is familiar. 
Well, I get that a lot. 
People say I sound like Michael Caine. 
- Do they? 
- Yeah. 
I'm not waiting for this death trap, I'm taking the bloody stairs. 
You used to live in 901 and then you moved to 301. 
Numb-nut sent me to the top floor. 
He's got it the wrong way round. 
We used to live on the ninth but there was plumbing problems. 
- How are you, Mr. Keyes? 
- Hello. 
Still feel you can't leave us on our own? 
No, got no life of me own, mate. 
This is our way of saying thank you to Chris as well. 
You shouldn't have done all this. 
We wanted it to be perfect. 
- Hi, I hope you brought an appetite. 
- Where was this taken? 
That was Eastbourne. 
Weren't it, love? 
Just after we got engaged. 
You alright, Johnny? 
You're looking a little bit peaky. 
Nothing a good supper won't cure. 
What are we eating? 
Okay, now you got to bear in mind that... 
I am working in the confines of a very small domestic kitchen. 
Don't give me that. 
Come on, Johnny, you know better than to go poking round another chef's kitchen. 
Here, you sit down. 
I'll get you a nice drink. 
You need to get yourself a girlfriend. 
He's never happier than when he's playing in that kitchen. 
Hot oil. 
Hot oil. 
That's in case he gets a puncture. 
All right for some. 
What's that smell? 
It's, well, roasting some garlic. 
Roasting or obliterating? 
Well done, babes. 
All right, bon appétit. 
Took my inspiration here from... the Catalonian gypsy way of cooking the dish. 
Which is to present the bird... as over-basted. 
That's what I like to call... 
" Peasant Pheasant." 
It looks really good. 
Shall I carve? 
Try the sauce. 
What do you think's in it? 
Too much. 
Right, anyone care for a brandy? 
No, I'm fine. 
Well, I'd love one. 
Why not? 
I don't suppose you could reach up to the top shelf could you, Johnny? 
This bottle's empty. 
Well I'll just nip over to the offy then, shall I? 
Won't take me five minutes. 
Lovely, sweetheart, would you go with her, Chris? 
Yeah, yes. 
Is anything wrong? 
We'll clear the table for you. 
There's a lot of me in you. 
You got the dreams, and you got the patter, and you got the pride. 
And you got the bullshit. 
I should know. 
I wanted to say this to you in private. 
And I'll do you the honor of speaking plainly. 
You ain't got it, son. 
You're passionate about your food and you can rustle up a meal. 
But you ain't got it. 
If I had a proper kitchen. 
You know, if I had the right gear. 
A good chef can whip up a gourmet meal on a hot car bonnet. 
You're slapdash about your ingredients. 
You throw too many flavors at it. 
Too many ingredients and not enough skill. 
Now, I could throw a load of cash at you anyway. 
But you wouldn't accept it... because you got principles and pride. 
And I respect that more than you'll ever know. 
- Look, Johnny. 
- Come with me. 
Hang on. 
Let's just give them a few more minutes. 
Where did you get this Madeira? 
Where did you get it, Jimmy? 
You know the day I tracked them down... those people that I thought were my parents... they wouldn't even let me in the house. 
That's when I found out that they'd dumped me. 
They paid the kidnappers good money for me, only to realize that I was... your boy. 
That was it. 
They didn't want me anymore. 
I came back that night. 
I was so angry. 
So... 
I just trashed the place. 
Why did you take the bottle? 
Because of the lion. 
Lions were my first memory. 
Guess that's where I get all my pride from. 
Samuel? 
It's a molded bottle. 
Early 20th century. 
You can see the seam. 
Here on the back." B 1936 HMS." 
It's a 1936 Boal vintage produced by H.M. Sortiz. 
No revenue stamp. 
I don't get it. 
The stopper cork has no wax cover. 
But that's not surprising... the cork itself has been infested. 
Maggots got right into it. 
The wine itself is lying low shoulder. 
It's undrinkable. 
But then, you'd never dream of opening this Madeira. 
Why not? 
This particular vintage was transferred to the Spanish mainland... and bottled there. 
Probably given the name of the ship that brought it. 
Leon. 
The Lion. 
But it's the etching here, in the glass itself. 
Now that's amazing. 
" F.F." 
So? 
What you are holding is a Madeira that was presented... to General Francisco Franco. 
On the day he was made commander-in-chief of the Spanish Army... in October, 1936. 
" F.F." 
Those scum you thought were your parents bought this as an investment. 
Now, it's your investment. 
This bloke's not looking to make money, is he? 
He's looking to give it away. 
So we spin him a sob story. 
But will that be enough? 
Because giving Danny the money has to be his idea. 
I mean, that should convince him more than any blood test. 
So the son persuades him to invest in a restaurant. 
That will mean that I got to learn to cook... which does sound far too much like hard work. 
We need him to pay up in cash. 
So, is it worth a few quid? 
Oh, yeah. 
I ain't felt this ruddy good in years. 
You and Paula deserve a start in life and you deserve something from me. 
To make up for not being there for you. 
You don't want handouts. 
Fine. 
I'll buy this bottle of wine off you. 
Call it 120? 
- 120 quid? 
- 120 grand. 
It ain't charity, son. 
It's what it's worth. 
I might even make a slim profit at auction one day. 
Yeah? 
So you can give me the money fair and square? 
It's business. 
A hundred and twenty grand? 
I've seen that smile on your face once before. 
When you first held my little finger. 
It's not too late for me to be a dad to you, is it? 
You and me, boy. 
You and me. 
We're kings. 
Kings of the ruddy jungle. 
Yeah. 
Come on! 
Johnny? 
What's wrong? 
It has to fool a trained eye. 
Find a way of rotting the cork. 
Get maggots into it. 
Rancid meat should do it. 
Age the bottle. 
An expert will know if it doesn't feel right. 
Every detail has to be perfect. 
- Get it. 
- No. Leave it. 
- Save it. 
- No. 
Leave it. 
I don't want to die. 
You're not gonna die. 
I'm just gonna call an ambulance. 
I've done.... 
I've been.... 
So many lies. 
I've told so many lies. 
Look, you did what you had to do, didn't you? 
You don't understand. 
I had the money. 
What? 
I had the ransom to pay the kidnappers. 
But I kept it. 
I called their bluff. 
It was my money to get started. 
I took a risk and I lost you. 
'Cause I wanted the business. 
Forgive me, son. 
I'm a liar... and a cheat. 
Forgive me. 
I forgive you... 
Dad. 
It was a work of art, Ash. 
You all right, Danny? 
I know he was a bully and a liar but... 
I lied to him, too, didn't I? 
The last thing he heard before he died was a lie. 
We don't just lie to people, Danny. 
We tell them what they want to hear. 
And for a moment... they're truly happy. 
So, can we see it, please? 
Absolutely. 
He rescued it, you know. 
With his last ounce of strength. 
He was a strong man. 
Weak in other ways. 
One hundred and twenty grand. 
I'm doing this because it's what Johnny wanted. 
- Thanks for everything you've done. 
- Now this is what I want. 
I want you to leave. 
Live your happy little lives and don't bother me again. 
I've got a business to sell off. 
So why did you bother making a back-up? 
As a back-up. 
I'm sorry, Mickey. 
I know I haven't been easy. 
You lost a friend, Albert. 
It's okay to grieve... but don't shut us out. 
You know, Keyes died well, didn't he? 
Thinking that his son had forgiven him. 
Maybe old Gil died well, too. 
Doing what he loved. 
I don't know, maybe I worry too much. 
There is no destination in life. 
The journey is everything. 
What? 
It's just, the things you come out with sometimes, Albert. 
You're still an inspiration, you know that? 
Father figure? 
I was thinking more grandfather figure. 
Okay, what about guru? 
Now guru, I like. 
And there's nothing to be scared of. 
We're all in this together. 
To the end. 
You okay, mate? 
I didn't see you. 
Yeah, just need a hand. 
For the poor? 
Yes. 
Of course. 
My son, you cannot buy your way into the Kingdom of Heaven. 
Just playing the percentages, sweetheart. 
We'll soon see who's laughing when Amanda Donohoe gets here. 
Double sixes again. 
I don't believe it. 
Come on. 
Thank you very much, do you want another go? 
Come on, what? 
You're bound to win sooner or later. 
I just got a bit lucky, that's all. 
Been a long time since I've seen anyone work the tat. 
- Sorry, mate, do I know you? 
- I was watching. 
Pretty good. 
Just got a bit lucky, that's all. 
All I'm saying is I'm wise to all your tricks now, that's all. 
- Is that right? 
- Yes, definitely. 
- The man's got 20-20 vision. 
- He's seen the light. 
My profits went up when you lot went away. 
I reckon you've been cheating me for years. 
- Eddie, how can you say that? 
- Because it's true. 
Can we at least have our drinks? 
I feel like we've been waiting here at least 20 minutes. 
You've only just got here. 
Feels like 20 minutes to me. 
Does it not feel like 20 minutes to you, Mickey? 
It feels like 20 minutes to me. 
- Maybe the man doesn't want our money. 
- No wonder his profits are down. 
How much would you say they were down by, Eddie? As much as, say, 20 %? 
- Twenty percent? 
That's a bit harsh. - You know what, I bet it is 20. 
- Twenty? 
- Yeah. 
That much? 
If Eddie says it's 20, then 20 it must be. 
- Twenty percent, who'd have thought? 
- Yeah, well... no more, so you'd better get used to it. 
- Five, 10.... 10 makes- - 
- Twenty. 
- Thanks very much, Eddie. 
- Thanks, sweetheart. 
- Edward. 
- Albert. 
- Well? 
- We're on. 
Do us a coffee, Eddie, stick it on the slate. 
No more slates, strictly cash. 
- Oh, not again. 
- The worm has finally turned. 
Albert says the mark's ready. 
We're good to go. 
Great. 
So where's Danny? 
You were a dip? 
No, I was the best dip in London. 
You were the best dip, were you? 
Telling you, mate, there's no one like me before or since. 
- Oh, yeah, your were that good? 
- I was better than that. 
- Brilliant. 
- Go on, then, let's have a look, show us. 
- You want me to show you? 
- Yeah. 
I'll show you. 
- First of all, hang on, you got the time? 
- Yep. 
Where did you.... 
There wasn't.... 
That's good, that's good. 
All right, yeah. 
- Anyway, so who's gonna get the bill? 
- When did.... 
That was in me pocket. 
I was sat down on it. 
Don't worry, mate, don't worry, we'll get a check. 
You got a pen? 
Listen, you gotta look after yourself, ain't you, in this game... 
-' cause no one's gonna do nothing for you. 
- You don't have to tell me. 
You don't have to tell me, I was scraping around for years... 
- before anyone would give me a shot. 
- Yeah? 
Come here. 
Top knowing you, top man, see you around. 
Yeah, good seeing you. 
Listen, where you going? 
- I'm just going off to find a cab. 
- Yeah, I'll come with you. 
- Yeah? 
- Yeah. 
All right. 
Listen, we could team up, me and you... you know, double bubble. 
No, I don't work the short con anymore. 
- Why not? 
- Moved on, didn't I? 
- Yeah? - Bigger and better things. 
- Like what? 
- I joined up with a long con crew last year. 
- The long con? 
- Yep. 
- That's big money, ain't it? 
- Can be. 
- Can you get me in? 
- No, sorry, mate, it's not my call. 
Right, so, someone gives you a leg up... 
- and then you shut the door behind you. 
- It's not like that, it's just... 
- they're my crew that's all. 
- Just a gofer, is you? 
No, I'm not. 
I'm an equal partner. 
An equal partner who ain't got a say in nothing. 
Shut up. 
Listen, forget it, I'm gonna go. 
Next time you're in Neasden, give us a bell. 
- All right. 
Neasden? 
- Yeah? 
- That's my old manor. 
- Well, it's mine now. 
Evelyn's caf still there? 
Yeah, broke me tooth on one of her burgers last week. 
What about the Blue Boy Pub? 
Yeah, still a dive. 
Come on round, I'll buy you a pint. 
No, wait. 
Let's have another drink. 
- Still no sign of Danny, then? 
- He's not answering his phone. 
He'll be here. 
Time we got started. 
Anthony Mgube, born in Nigeria, resides in Switzerland. 
Not a very nice man by any criteria you choose to apply. 
His reputation in the army was for torturing prisoners. 
He left the army and joined the government... then he fled to Switzerland... following allegations of embezzlement and fraud. 
He sells arms to militia groups and mercenaries in East Africa. 
He has two main passions in his life... his racing stables in Newmarket... and his collection of antique banknotes. 
All right. 
How's it hanging? 
Listen, I want you to all meet my new best friend, Trevor.... 
- Speed. 
- Speed. 
There's Acie, Stash... 
- Albert, that's the lovely Albert. 
- All right. 
No, he's the lovely Albert. 
Legend, take note, this is the great Mickey Bricks... con man extraordinaire, all round top.... 
- Don't do that, Mickey. 
- A word, please, Danny? 
All right, I'll be right back, Trev. 
I'll be back, Trev.... 
What the bloody hell do you think you're playing at? 
It's Trevor, isn't it? Trevor Speed, he's one of us. 
You're drunk. 
- I've just had a couple, all right. 
- What have you told him? 
It's okay, all right, listen, he's a grifter... 
I caught him working the tat. 
You do not bring people here. 
If there's a problem.... 
There's no problem here, mate, no problem here. 
Okay. 
Yes, there is a problem. 
Why don't you just lighten up, Mickey? 
Lighten up, will you? He's not just some muppet I found on the street. 
- I'm telling you, he's one of us. 
- I very much doubt that. 
Mickey, you're making me look very bad here, all right, I invited him. 
Please don't make me look very bad...'cause then I'll feel bad. 
All right, I'll vouch for him. Okay? 
- We don't know anything about him. 
- Yeah, well, I do, all right. 
And you said yourself we needed somebody for the Gooby Dooby thing. 
- Mgube. 
- And that as well. 
Look, I'll vouch for him. 
That's it, please, for once in your life... trust me. 
No, Danny. 
It's all our necks on the line and I, for one, like to know the people I'm working with. 
We'll do this another time. 
- Sorry, man. 
- What did I do? 
Can you please explain the logic to me, of us going £ 4 overdrawn... and you charging me £ 85 to tell me about it? 
Well, now I'm £ 89 overdrawn. 
Thank you. 
Goodbye. 
- Problem? 
- Yeah, the man is a moron. 
- It's a prerequisite for his profession. 
- Come on, don't let it get to you. 
No, Mickey, I want you to go and beat him up for me. 
- Are we having a tantrum? 
- Yes. 
Do you know, he's starting to make me feel nervous. 
Yeah, well, apparently his profits have gone down since we got back. 
Everything's about money these days. 
Welcome. 
Don't mention Mgube. 
We'll talk about it later. 
Eddie, this is Trevor. 
Sorry. 
Oh, sorry, look, one word, all right. 
- Principle. 
- Principle? 
- Yeah, principle, okay. 
- Go on. 
- I'm an equal partner. 
- Yeah. 
- I'm entitled to my say. 
- Absolutely. 
- I got an equal voice. 
- Same as everyone else. 
Okay, you lot all knew each other before I come along, all right. 
To me, it's like I'm on the outside looking in. 
- Oh, Danny. 
- Yeah, it's like... the kid with the nose pressed up against the window. 
So this, it's all a matter of principle, yeah? 
That's it, Ash, principle. 
Yeah. 
I said I'd vouch for the bloke, didn't I? 
I mean, I think my word... should be vouchable. And if it's not, then.... 
I guess what I'm saying is, if it's not, then I'm gonna have to walk. 
There you go, I've said it now. 
I mean, sometimes a bloke has to stand up for... what he stands for. 
He has a point. 
A little trust goes a long way. 
Yeah, but we don't know him. 
Well, we didn't know Danny when we took him on. 
Okay. 
Danny. 
Okay, we're gonna give him a chance on this one job. 
The first time he screws up, he's out. 
Cheers, thanks, you won't regret it. 
I didn't mean what I said and sorry about burping in your face. 
Love you all. 
- So, how do we get to this Mgube? 
- His hobby. 
He has a world-renowned collection of rare banknotes. 
Yeah, he looks like he's worth a few quid. 
Last time, it was estimated at $ 60 million. 
- How many noughts is that, then? 
- Lots. 
And the way in? 
He's desperate to add one new note to his collection. 
Yankee Green known because- - 
It's green? 
Extremely so, yes. 
It was a new color process that did not catch on. 
But that in itself adds to its value. 
It's a $ 1,000 treasury note issued in 1866. 
The head is of General George Gordon Meade... 
Commander of the Union Forces at the Battle of Gettysburg. 
How much is something like that worth, then? 
Only two are known to still be in existence. 
One is owned by the Chicago Confederate Bank... for which they paid $ 200,000 nine years ago. 
And I take it that Mgube has offered to buy it and been turned down? 
Frequently, yes. 
So, where do we come in? 
Now, the second note.... 
Only a handful of people know its whereabouts. 
Fortunately, I'm one of them. 
The CEO of the company that insures it is a friend of mine. 
Everyone's a friend of yours, Albie. 
The owner of the note is Anne Foster. 
It is kept in her late husband's collection. 
But Mgube doesn't know anything about her? 
He knows the second note belongs to a private collector... he just hasn't been able to track it down. 
Even if he did, she's made it clear that she will never sell it. 
Okay, so we got a millionaire who wants something and we know where it is. 
- Now, what? 
- Can't we just nick it? 
Can we forge the note? 
Possible. 
But chances are Mgube knows the serial number. 
We'll need to see the real one. 
- Which means? 
- Getting close enough to the original. 
Mrs. Foster? 
No, it's nothing serious, Mrs. Foster, we'd simply like to update our assessment... on some of the more valuable items that we insure. 
- My premiums are up to date, you know. 
- No. 
No, it's more a case of making sure... that some of the items are in the same condition as... when the insurance was taken out. 
I'm 83, you know. 
I don't believe that. 
You don't look a day over 75. 
Would you like another slice of cake? 
Maybe later. 
Anyway, moving on. 
Right, jewelry, that should be fine. 
- I see here you have some banknotes. 
- My late husband's. 
Right, okay. 
Always a danger of damp with those. 
They're in a sealed cabinet. 
Do you mind if we have a look? 
There are a few more things we need for the Mgube con. 
But it seems we're short of working capital. 
And then I thought to myself... who do I know who could solve a problem like that? 
- What do we need? 
- I've got a list. 
Cor blimey, you don't want much, do you? 
- Leave it with me. 
- Okay. 
Was everything all right with your stay, sir? 
If you'd just like to sign at the bottom for me. 
Thank you. 
The Lexington. 
This is Credit Card Authorization. 
I understand you've got an authorization problem. 
- Well, everything looks fine here. 
- It's just showed up on me screen. 
- I don't know why that is. 
- I tell you what's happened. 
- Did you just do a card transaction? 
- Yes, a credit card. 
You did? 
Yeah, well, it may not have gone through. 
Do you wanna give me the card number so I can check it? 
Sure, the number is 4628.... 
Yeah, I'd like to make a credit card purchase, please. 
Okay. 
Tweezers. 
Yeah. 
Is something wrong? 
Probably not.... 
I think we may have to take some photographs... just to update our files, if that's okay? 
You must do whatever you think best. 
Yankee Green. 
- Can you do it? 
- Paper might be difficult. 
- What about the seal? 
- No, I can do that. 
- Who does it have to pass? 
- A collector. 
- Lab tests? 
- No, hopefully not. 
- Is it doable? 
- Everything's doable, Mr. Stone. 
- At a price. 
- Right. 
Half now, half when it's done. 
But I've paid money into the account now, so... couldn't you just take off the charges? 
A reason? 
Well, how about customer service? 
Or just plain, old-fashioned bloody courtesy? 
I am not swearing at you, I'm just trying to point out... that you're an arrogant little man with a brain the size of a pea. 
Hello? 
Hello? 
- He hung up. 
- I can't think why. 
Right, this means war. 
It's £ 85, my dear. 
Isn't war a little overzealous? 
It's the principle. 
Principle again. 
It seems to be the word of the moment. 
- Get your coat, Albie. 
- Why? 
Because we are gonna get him. 
- Get him? 
- Hopkins. 
Yep, he knows me but you can be my secret weapon. 
Come on. 
Look, be that as it may, Mrs. Reeves, we have a very simple system here. 
Let me unscramble the intricacies of it for you. 
If you have money in your account, you can take it out. 
- You haven't. 
- Come on, kids. 
Mr. Hopkins? 
Harrison Wyngate. 
- Please. 
- Thank you. 
- Let me. 
- Fine. 
Okay, next step, Mgube. 
We've got a contact in the limousine company he's using... so we know he's due to visit the banknote dealers in the Strand this afternoon. 
- We can do that, can't we, Trev? 
- Yeah. 
He did really good today, Mick, with the old girl. 
- Have you ever worked on a long con? 
- I've read about it. 
Yeah, well, I'll make the play, he'll just back me up. 
I'd rather you took Ash. 
All right, Mick, you're the boss, it's your call, but.... 
I mean, I wouldn't be sitting here, would I, if somebody hadn't taught me? 
Do not louse this up. 
No, we won't. 
Setting up a transfer is no problem. 
Do you have an account here? 
No, not yet but the young lady out there gave me the forms to fill out. 
Once your application has been processed we can give you an account number... so you can arrange the transaction. 
Do you know how much you'll be transferring? 
3 million, yes. 
- Excuse me? 
- That's just the first installment. 
- First? 
- Yes, the company I represent... has purchased some land nearby to develop. 
So we need a holding account, pay the construction staff, that sort of thing. 
Well, I'm assuming a branch this size can deal with that amount of money? 
Of course. 
I've always believed that having a strong relationship... with the branch you're dealing with makes life a lot easier. 
Head offices can be so tedious. 
Quite. 
Well, it'll be quite a coup for you, I guess. 
I'm sure your superiors will be impressed. 
Well, rest assured, Mr. Wyngate... the bank and I will be at your complete disposal. 
Lovely, brilliant. 
Well, now that I've got him, what shall we do with him? 
I'll think of something. 
I'm sure you will, my dear, I'm sure you will. 
- We're calling on all banknote dealers. 
- Customs and Excise? 
Yeah, this is absolutely nothing to do with your business. 
We've checked your accounts. 
Everything seems fine. 
Just to let you know, we'll be here as part of our surveillance. 
Surveillance? 
Yeah, there's a money laundering gang, taking money out of the country... by investing in rare coins and banknotes. 
So, what do you want me to do? 
Oh, nothing. No. 
Just pretend we're not here and if anyone asks... then we're just members of staff. 
But I can't possibly have strangers wandering around the shop. 
Oh, well, should you decide not to help with our investigation... we would have to ask ourselves, why? 
No, of course, please. 
I'll help in any way I can. 
Well, that's super, that really is super, thank you. 
Perhaps you could wait in the back office? 
Shouldn't take more than a couple of hours. 
- Hello. 
- Danny. 
Mgube's car is just pulling up outside. 
Okay. 
Mr. Harris, thank you for calling back, sir. 
Yes, I have located the notes you asked for... and I will fax them over this afternoon. 
That's my pleasure, sir. 
That is not a problem, sir. 
The Yankee Green? 
Have located it. 
Not managed to get hold of the owner yet, though. 
Absolutely, sir. 
I'll let you know as soon as I know. 
Goodbye, sir. 
Excuse me, did I hear you mention the Yankee Green? 
- Sir? 
- You spoke about it on the telephone. 
I'm sorry, sir. 
I can't discuss orders from other clients. 
Do you know who I am? 
I'm here to purchase a large number of notes. 
Well, maybe you'd like to have a little look at our catalogue? 
I would like you to bring it to my apartment... in person, in one hour. 
Not quite sure I'm gonna be able to do that. 
I take it you earn commission on your sales? 
Yes, I do. 
I intend to spend many thousands. 
Bring your catalogue in one hour. 
Please do not be late. 
Where've you been? 
- Mickey gave me a shopping list. 
- Did you get what you need? 
- Yeah, all done. 
- Good, I got another job for you. 
Cor blimey, I've never been so popular. 
Well, it's more of a personal favor. 
Go on, then. 
Stacie and I would like you to turn these into proper building plans. 
What for? 
Much as I'd love to tell you, it's more than my life is worth, dear boy. 
Right, you know what you're doing, yeah? 
Silence is golden. 
Egg you on when I need to. 
Get the hump when you move towards the door. 
That's it, good luck. 
All right? How you doing? 
Mr. Mgube in? 
Asked us to pop in. 
- What's going on? 
Same bloke, ain't it? 
- What? 
Don't know who.... 
No. 
Offer him money as long as he agrees to sign by tomorrow. 
If that doesn't work... then tell him I asked after his wife and children. 
Good. 
Hello. 
I've brought the catalogue for you, sir. 
This is my assistant, James. 
I am not interested in your catalogue, young man. 
I want to talk about the Yankee Green. 
Did explain that, sir- - 
I will match whatever your other client is willing to pay. 
Yeah, I'm sorry, sir- - 
And give you £ 20,000 for yourself. 
I really don't think we should be having this conversation, sir. 
Each. 
I'm very sorry. 
You did say £ 20,000, each? 
At last. 
Gentlemen in this country I can do business with. 
Okay. 
So, what is your other client's offer? 
£ 500,000. 
Okay, bring me the note. 
If it's genuine, I will pay you in cash. 
- This is- - 
- Wait. 
You got to be kidding me. 
Oh, I can't believe it! 
Maybe we should have upped it. 
He said" yes" too easy. 
Do you know how much money that is? 
Yes, I do, boy. 
Come on, we gotta get back, let's go. 
This way. 
Where did you two sneak off to earlier today? 
Albie went to see Hopkins at the bank. 
- To do what? 
- lf he can steal £ 85 off us... how much is he taking off people who can't afford it? 
It's extortion. 
Maybe, but... isn't sending Albert a bit like using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut? 
He needs to be taught a lesson. 
Right, I'm sure he does. 
Oh, here they are. 
- Well? 
- Am I the bollocks, or what? 
Yes! 
Price? 
You ready for this? 
- You tell them. 
- Can I? 
Someone bleeding tell us. 
Half a million. 
No. 
So, what's next? 
I spoke to Ray about an hour ago, the note's ready. 
You can pick it up at Eddie's tomorrow morning. 
Great. 
Mate, that Stacie bird is a bit of all right. 
Is she up for it, or what? 
Don't even think about it, Trevor. 
- Why not? 
- Why not? 
Because she's gonna eat you for breakfast... she's gonna spit out the bones, it's gonna be very messy. 
- Tried yourself, have you? 
- You could say that. 
And? 
And I had more slaps than a Morris dancer's ankles. 
- Maybe you're not her type. 
- What, and you are? 
Maybe. 
Police. 
- Very funny. 
- All right, Ash says you're finished. 
A flaming... work... 
- of art. 
- Pleased to hear it. 
- It looks really old, doesn't it? 
- Yeah, I think that is the general idea. 
- Well? 
- Right. 
Nice one, Ray. 
Don't spend it all at once. 
- Looks good. 
- Genius. 
- You think he'll go for it? 
- Only one way to find out. 
Thank you, sir. 
Thank you, Mr. Mgube. Bye-bye. 
Okay, I told him I've located the seller. 
Okay, we fixed the price. 
I'm gonna pick up the note tonight. 
He's flying to Switzerland tomorrow. 
Everything's perfect. 
Okay, then we're all set. 
- What do you think? 
- It's evil. 
Disproportionate to the £ 85... he and his stupid little bank stole from us? 
- Yes. 
- Good. 
This is the main retail area, cinema complex, theater district. 
It's huge. 
Has planning been approved? 
We're looking at 6,000 jobs. 
The council has given us virtually carte blanche. 
- I bet they have. 
- Construction begins in six weeks. 
- What's the shaded area here? 
- Oh, car parking. 
That'll cover most of the current Portway Estate. 
And this is the only section that hasn't been acquired. 
Small but crucial. 
It will give us the best access to the car parks. 
- Who does it belong to? 
- I have no idea. 
Fortunately, it's not our problem. 
We've put the car parking out to franchise. 
But whoever owns it, they're about to be offered an awful lot of money. 
You talking to me? 
Neil Marchant, Customs and Excise. 
Neil Marchant. 
Neil Marchant, Customs and Excise. 
Yeah, we're doing a bit of surveillance. 
Half a million. 
Half a million. 
Hello? 
Yeah, it is. 
I mean, all I'm saying is you never give me a fair chance. 
It's all tricks and things I can't work out. 
So, you feel the odds are stacked against you? 
Exactly, look, I don't mind joining in, but you've got Danny... with his find-the-lady card thing, I can never find it. 
Then you got Ash with his double-headed coins. 
Yeah, double tails,'cause most people call heads. 
That's what I'm talking about, that, all that jiggery-pokery. 
So, from now on, you pay for your drinks like normal people... or at least just give me a fair chance. 
- A fair chance? 
- Yeah. 
It's not that you're cleverer than me, it's just, you cheat. 
Okay, all right, a fair chance. 
Okay. 
There's £ 50. 
Now you take £ 50 from the till. 
It's okay, look, there's mine on the bar. 
No cheating. 
- How much is there? 
- £ 100. 
Okay. So now we both bid for it and the highest bid takes it. 
- We both bid? - You got it. 
- Whoever bids most gets it? 
- The whole £ 100. 
Fair enough for you? 
Okay, you go first. 
Okay. 
- £ 50. 
- £ 60. 
Okay, you win. 
Give me £ 60 and the £ 100 is yours. 
- I won, right? 
- Absolutely. 
You'll get us barred. 
I cannot help myself. 
- All right, chaps? 
- You're late. 
Sorry, boss, I had a bit of business to take care of. 
Yeah. Here's the note. 
Ray says it'll stand up to a visual but not if they run chemical tests. 
So the first sign of a test tube, complain about damaging the note... 
- and get the hell out of there. 
- Got it. 
This has to be done tonight. 
Mgube flies back to Switzerland tomorrow afternoon. 
Right. Wish us luck. 
If you're good enough, you won't need it. 
Hang on, if I gave you £ 60 and you only put £ 50 in... 
I must be a tenner down. 
It's all right, I'll toss him for it. 
Right, same thing, yeah. 
- I do all the talking, right? 
- Right. 
Like Mickey says, if he gets out some fancy testing kit... 
- we make our excuses and we leave. 
- Right. 
The most important thing, all right, is to look a bit nervous... like we know we shouldn't be there. 
He knows what we're doing could cost us our jobs. 
Let's make him think he's doing all the running. 
- Right. 
- You ready? 
What's wrong? 
- Oh, no. 
It's gone. 
- What do you mean, it's gone? 
I must have left it in the bar. 
No, you didn't leave it in the bar, you put it in your pocket. 
- I must have dropped it. 
- No, you didn't drop it, have a look. 
I don't believe it, I put it in me pocket. 
I don't believe you. 
All right, don't panic. 
Focus. 
Right, let's retrace our steps. 
- Well, look then. 
- I don't believe this. 
Just get looking and stop with your bloody whining. 
Hold on. 
What? 
- I put it in my pocket, I swear. 
- He's dropped it, ain't he? 
He's dropped it somewhere between here and the apartment. 
We've retraced our steps, but someone's picked it up. 
Of all the stupid.... 
Danny, you said you'd vouch for him. 
Yeah, all right, Mickey, it could happen to anyone. 
Only it didn't, did it? It happened to him. 
Can we get another one made? 
No, not in the time. 
Mgube's flying back tomorrow. 
- So we're finished? 
- Yeah, afraid so. 
Do you have any idea how much money you've just cost us? 
All right. 
I've lost out as well, you know. 
You didn't put any money in to set this up. 
Got half a million quid just sitting there, waiting to be picked up. 
- Get him out of here. 
- Hold on. 
Listen, maybe you'd better go. 
- This ain't just down to me. 
- I said," Get him out." 
Hey, just go. 
Come on. 
- Just go. 
- Out, get out. 
All right. I'm leaving. 
Get out. 
Losers. 
Hey. 
Okay, just put the cards down flat for a second. 
My leg. 
Not playing cards with the boys? 
No, Albert cheats. 
- Yeah, he does. 
- It's funny, isn't it? 
With old Trevor. 
- What do you mean? 
- Weren't that long ago... 
- I weren't that much different from him. 
- Don't be ridiculous. 
- You're nothing like him. 
- No, short con artist... 
- scratching a living. 
- No way, Danny. He's cheap. 
Everything's about the money. 
So he misses the beauty of the game. 
The beauty? 
You know, you're beautiful. 
Thank you. 
- Can I ask you something? 
- I suppose so. 
You keep knocking me back, yeah. 
Now, is it because.... 
No, listen, is it because.... 
Is it because we work together... 
- or is it because you don't fancy me? 
- What do you think? 
I used to think it was' cause we worked together and then I got thinking... maybe... 
I'm just not your type. 
And what do you think my type is, then? 
I don't know. 
Somebody more like Mickey. 
Like Mickey or Mickey specifically? 
Well, why don't you tell me? 
- I love you both. 
- You love us both? 
Yeah, but loving us both... that's just one of those girly things, isn't it... when you don't want to shag someone... but you don't want to hurt their feelings, either... so you pretend you're just good friends and you don't want to spoil it. 
So, just so I'm absolutely crystal clear on this, yeah... a shag is definitely out of the question? 
- You don't mind me asking, though? 
- No, I'm flattered, Danny. 
Thanks for our little chat and... no offense. 
None taken. 
No, listen the deal's still on, it's just that he's got cold feet, that's all. 
- You definitely have the note? 
- Yeah. 
When can I have it? 
I can have the note to you by 10 : 00 tomorrow. 
- 10. : 00 is okay. 
- And you'll have the money ready? 
Do not worry, young man. 
- Tomorrow at 10 : 00, then. 
- Good. 
Bye. 
Muppets. 
- Mrs. Foster. 
- Yes? 
Can I come in? 
The thing is, Mrs. Foster... when we studied the photographs we've discovered... 
- that the note has been damaged. 
- Damaged? 
Irretrievably, I'm afraid. 
Which is why we've decided to pay out. 
I don't understand. 
Perhaps I should telephone my son. 
No, there's no need for that. 
All I'm here for is to give you a little bit of money. 
- What for? 
- For the damaged note. 
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I still don't quite understand. 
Listen... you remember, we came to do some photographs, on the note? 
Well, the note has been damaged, darling. 
The company thought you might find this all confusing. 
£ 150,000 in cash. 
It's a sort of down payment to make you feel a little bit better. 
I just need you to sign this. 
- I need my spectacles. 
- No, it's all right, it's just one signature. 
Right there. 
Of course, I will have to take the note back with me. 
I have to call Peter. 
I don't understand when it comes to banks, money, and insurances. 
I really would like to talk to my son. 
I'm not quite sure that I understand what you mean. 
Well, you've already sold it to me, haven't you? 
Don't you remember? 
All legal, money's there. 
I'm not selling anything. 
Blimey, you're getting forgetful, aren't you, sweetheart? 
I'll see myself out. 
Please, I don't think I want to do this. 
Mr. Mgube's expecting me. 
Mr. Mgube. 
- You have it? 
- Yeah. 
Do you have the money? 
£ 500,000, as agreed. 
- And the extra £ 40,000? 
- Your colleague is no longer with you. 
Which means I get his share. 
The note. 
Pay the man. 
It's been a real pleasure doing business with you gents. 
- I reckon... about now. 
- Can I help you? 
- I'm here to see Mrs. Foster. 
- Who? 
- Mrs. Foster, she lives here. 
- No, she doesn't. 
- So, who the hell are you? 
I live here, this is my house. 
- What? 
- We've just come back off holiday. 
- How'd we do, Betty? 
- Or should we call you Mrs. Foster? 
£ 150,000. 
- You're joking. 
- No way. 
We only had him down for £ 20,000, £ 25,000 tops. 
Seems the little shit was holding out on you. 
Well, that's what we thought he had stashed in the caravan, but.... 
Seems he came into a small windfall. 
Hello? 
Yeah, it is. 
Our favorite bank manager... must have bought his worthless caravan... and even more worthless land for.... 
£ 150,000 in cash. 
Yes, I'm trying to find out who's won the car parking franchise... for the new development on the Portway Estate? 
What do you mean," what development"? 
Let me talk to the Planning Officer. 
Here's the note. 
The most important thing, all right, is to look a bit nervous... like we know we shouldn't be there. 
He knows what we're doing could cost us our jobs. 
Let's make him think he's doing all the running. 
- Right. 
- You ready? 
What's wrong? 
- Oh, no. 
It's gone. 
- What do you mean, it's gone? 
Oh, yeah. All right. Sorry. 
I can't believe you started without me. 
Yeah, can I hire a limousine? 
In the name Mgube. 
It's traditional. 
Yes, it's sort of Nigerian... you know, yeah. 
Twelve white shirts, 16 collar, and a dozen assorted ties. 
Perks. 
It's white or white. 
What do you reckon? 
- Well, I think.... 
- Yeah, I thought white myself. 
- White? 
- Yeah. 
£ 500,000 as agreed. 
Did you hear about Stacie's little contribution? 
- Oh, yeah. 
- Brilliant, even if I do say so myself. 
- Where do you want me, Mick? 
- Out front. 
I wish I could see his face. 
- Can I help you, sir? 
- What's going on? 
- It's been closed down. 
- What for? 
I don't know. 
CID just dragged a gang out of there. 
Con men I reckon. 
- Do you have any business here, sir? 
- No. 
Move along, then. 
- Eddie, you look confused. 
- Well, wouldn't you be? 
Yeah, well, let me explain. 
No! 
Don't tell me,'cause I don't even wanna know. 
Wonder where that little weasel's sleeping tonight. 
Yeah, well, at least we let him keep his van. 
Yeah, we did. 
We should have had that as well. 
- He had it coming to him. 
- Giving honest con men a bad name. 
Where did you find the little creep? 
Well, he found us, kind of. 
I don't get it. 
I reckon he's been fleecing little old ladies his whole life. 
- Good morning, darling. 
Mr. Rice? 
- That's my husband. 
Is he in? 
I've got a parcel for him. 
- He passed away. 
- Oh, I'm sorry. 
- I can take it. 
- It's cash on delivery and it's £ 85. 
But what is it? 
I guess what I'm holding here was most likely the last thing... your husband ordered before he passed away. 
- Listen, don't you worry, I'll take it back. 
- No, wait. I'll get my purse. 
Okay. 
But then he made a very big mistake. 
He picked on the wrong little old lady. 
Nan! 
Hello, darling. 
We got him. 
Yeah, we did. 
I tell you what, he's never gonna con you again and you're our guest of honor. 
- Oh, I don't get out much. 
- Don't you? 
The taxi driver was very nice. 
Was he now, you weren't chatting him up, were you? 
- Oh, Daniel! 
- I know what you old girls are like. 
All right, what do you fancy? 
A little glass of champagne? 
Champagne? 
Oh, I'll be up all night. 
You will be up all night...'cause you're gonna be dancing with your favorite grandson. 
Let's have it, come on. 
Listen, Mickey, can I pay the money into the bank? 
- All of it? 
- Yeah. 
I just want to watch Hopkins counting his money... into our account. 
There is a very wicked streak in you, do you know that? 
Well, there's nothing quite like getting even. 
Nothing at all. 
Thanks, Stacie. 
How about a little toast, then? 
Here's to Granddad, Nan. 
Cheers. 
- Really, Eddie, you have been fantastic. 
- I'm not listening. 
- Why? 
-' Cause you'll take money off me. 
- How can you say that? 
- Because you do. 
Eddie. 
All right, I'll listen, but I'm not opening that till. 
Well, okay, yeah, fair enough. 
Hey, I've gotta show you this. 
How long do you think it'll take me to drink three large brandies? 
Depends how thirsty you were. 
- Under a second. 
- No way. 
Yeah, how much? 
No, I've told you, there's no way I'm opening that till. 
Okay, for fun, then. 
- Fun? 
- Absolutely. 
- No money? 
- No. 
- Okay. 
- Okay. 
Set them up. 
- Under a second? 
- Yep, under a second. 
- I'll do the timing. 
- Yeah, agreed. 
- Say when. 
- Go. 
Stop! 
You lose! 
Yes! 
Will you stop doing that, please? 
Yeah, pay for your drinks like everyone else. 
To Eddie. 
Cheers, Eddie, thank you! 
Do I have 70? 
Seventy. 
Seventy-five. 
Eighty. 
Eighty-five. 
Ninety. 
Ninety-five. 
One hundred. 
Drawn in 1934 by Leonard Wright. 
The original artwork for the cover of Black Storm, Issue One. 
At £ 100,000. 
Any more bids? 
One-ten. 
One-ten. 
At £ 110,000. 
Going once, going twice. 
Sold. 
I can't believe we just did that. 
Hello, Eddie. 
I need more time. 
- Time's up, I want my £ 10,000. 
- I haven't got it. 
It's these bloody grifters, they don't pay for anything. 
Then you shouldn't let them gamble in your bar, should you? 
I mean, I am a police officer. 
I've got to report it. 
- You're gonna lose your license. 
- But you can't. 
This place is all I've got. 
You ever been to prison, Eddie? 
What's that? 
That's counterfeit money you've been laundering through your till. 
Please. I tell you what, I will settle for some names. I want the big fish. 
No. 
No way. 
I am not a grass. 
Wrong answer, Eddie. 
Okay! 
There's this crew that drink in here, they play the long con. 
Names. 
Mickey Bricks. 
Maybe I am missing something here. 
Only, I thought we were grifters. 
- I mean we could've lifted this. 
- And then what? 
I don't know. 
Do our thing, don't we? 
Work the magic. 
Great plan, Danny. 
It's wiped out our working capital. 
We will have to raise some cash. 
Think of it as an investment. 
Black Storm was one of the original superheroes, and this... is the Mona Lisa of comic book artwork. 
That's why we had to pay £ 110,000 for it. 
They say you have to speculate to accumulate. 
No, you know, it feels all wrong. 
We should be really proud of ourselves. 
For once, we did not break the law. 
Ash, how are the auction house blueprints looking? 
It won't be easy, but it's definitely doable. 
Right, we've got two weeks until the next auction. 
Meantime, we'll need to raise some working capital. 
But the beauty of it is, our guy can delay the currency movement... just long enough for us to place a spread bet. 
We've been clearing 300, 400 % profit, easy. 
- That's beautiful. 
- That's beautiful, but illegal. 
- But foolproof? 
- Completely. 
I'm in. 
Definitely. 
Let's do it. 
Right. 
You'd have to be an idiot not to. £ 25,000. 
Thank you. 
Let's see what we've got here. 
Yeah. 
Thank you. 
Beats working for a living. 
Can I help you? 
I am arresting you for fraud. 
You don't have to say anything... but it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned... something which you later rely on in court. 
You can go for now. 
I will contact you, take a statement. 
Turn around. 
Okay, here's the deal. 
You two can go to prison, or I can walk out of here... with the money and we all forget this ever happened. 
A bent copper. 
- So much for" Protect and Serve." 
- Brilliant. 
You think for one second that we are going to let you... swan out of here with £ 25,000? 
You're dreaming, missy. 
I think that's exactly what you're going to do... unless Mickey here fancies another spell inside. 
Not particularly. 
People like you, yeah, they give the police a very bad name. 
I take it we have a deal. Now, okay. 
Do anything stupid, he testifies, you two go to prison. 
Got it? 
You know what they say, what goes around comes around. 
Then I'd be seriously worried, if I were you. 
- Yours? 
- Yeah, I like to draw. 
- You are very good, aren't you? 
- That's what my art teacher said. 
Now, what would a couple of grifters be doing... with artwork worth £ 100,000? 
Like the catalogue says, we're auctioning it. 
Yeah, I mean it's completely legit. 
We got receipts, we got everything. 
What's she doing? 
What are you doing? 
Basically you've got five seconds to tell me the score or I torch it. 
We told you. 
There's no score. 
Yeah, we're auctioning some artwork. 
No law against it. 
- There's no score. 
- You wouldn't dare. 
All right! 
We will tell you! 
Put it out! 
Now, you tell me everything... or this time, it won't be a beer mat. 
We're auctioning the artwork this afternoon. 
We needed a genuine piece because the auction house like to authenticate... the artwork before they sell it. 
While it's on display at the viewing... we switch the authentic artwork for a forgery. 
It's the forgery that gets auctioned. 
And then on the side... we sell the authentic artwork to a rival collector. 
Yeah, and we clear £ 100,000 profit. 
You clear £ 50,000 profit. I get the other 50. 
Fifty? 
One phone call to the auction house, you don't make a penny. 
Now, we need the £ 25,000 to pay the forger. 
Fair enough. 
Don't worry, we will meet you back here after the auction. 
You know what? 
I think I will tag along for the ride. 
One condition. 
Once you get your money, tell us who sold us out. 
What makes you think someone sold you out? 
So, where to? 
We need to pick up the forgery. 
Bye, Eddie. 
- Everything all right, Mick? 
- Absolutely fantastic. 
This is great. 
What do you think we should do? 
Tell the others? 
No, they've got their jobs to do. 
So- - Did anyone ever tell you it's rude to whisper? 
- Do you think she's fit? 
- Don't... 
- What? 
-... even think about it. 
You know, would you have a few, you know, if you could? 
What do you mean, if I could? 
- What are you doing? 
- What are you doing? 
- Danny, get in the back. 
- You get in the back. 
No, I am not getting in the back. 
Is there a problem? 
The two collectors we outbid at the last auction won't want to lose out again. 
The higher they bid, the more profit we make. 
- A little encouragement goes a long way. 
- Absolutely. 
You have any preference? 
I'll take the geek. 
Be gentle. 
As a kitten. 
Morning. 
Landlord's gas safety checks. 
I need to inspect the gas appliances. 
It's actually not a very good time. 
I've got to leave for work. 
Well, that's your problem, you see. 
You're out all day, you get a buildup of gas from a faulty appliance. 
You come home, flick on a light switch, bang! 
Next thing you know, they are scraping your brains off the pavement. 
Right. 
Let's start with the cooker. 
It's electric. 
- Boiler? 
- In there. 
Okay, I need you to turn the hot tap on in the bathroom while I check it. 
Sad. 
Excuse me. 
I love Superman. 
Although, I've always preferred him more as Clark Kent, you know. 
Strong, but vulnerable, you know... those glasses. 
My little nephew, he's crazy about him as well. 
Actually, I wanted to get him a present. 
Could you help me find some other stuff, if you are not too busy? 
No, I mean, yes, I can help you. 
No, I'm not too busy. 
I'm Neil. 
It's my shop. 
What do you know about that? 
Excuse me. 
Yeah? 
I couldn't help noticing your auction catalogue. 
You must be here for the pop-art exhibition. 
Yeah, I am a sucker for Lichtenstein. 
- Are you a collector? 
- I've been known to dabble. 
Perhaps you could clear something up for me. 
What do you make of the idea... that Lichtenstein is mocking his subjects in his paintings? 
A common misconception. 
May I? 
Please, yes, of course. 
What Lichtenstein's comic book paintings show is a grown man finding... meaning in junk he's supposed to have thrown away. 
They are about the energy of adolescent fantasy. 
So, why comic books? 
Mickey was into them when he was a kid. 
Because there's too much security in the traditional art world. 
He was one of those specky kids. 
You know, a lot of crying. 
-" Please don't bully me." 
- Plus, the artwork is easier to forge. 
Yeah, that's right, Mickey. 
You keep telling yourself that, mate, yeah? 
Who would have thought it, the great Mickey Bricks taking the easy option. 
Yeah, that's good, coming from a parasite like you. 
It's just down here on the right. 
It's perfect. 
Tim will love it. 
- Thanks for all your help. 
- No, it was a pleasure. 
Bye-bye, then. 
Three, two, one. 
Are you doing anything later? 
There's an auction, comic book artwork. 
Maybe you and your nephew would like to come? 
- We'd love to. 
- Great. 
Great. 
It's the same energetic style, bold primary colors. 
The same single-mindedness you later find in Warhol's work. 
The comics inspired the pop-art movement. 
I'd sell my soul to own an original piece. 
I'll let you in on a little secret. 
I'll be bidding for some original artwork at the auction. 
Really? 
Which artist? 
Black Storm, the Mona Lisa of comic book artwork. 
We could go to the auction together. 
Right, we'll need the £ 25,000. 
- I'm coming in with you. 
- No, that might not be such a good idea. 
- You know what these artists are like. 
- Yeah, you know, very sensitive. 
Say the wrong thing and you'll crush him. 
Don't say we didn't warn you. 
For £ 25,000, this forgery had better be good. 
Danny, you handsome little prick. 
Come here. 
Not the bear hug. 
- Hey, Mickey. 
- How you doing? 
Hello, gorgeous. 
Max, we are in a bit of a hurry. 
Max, we are really in a hurry. 
Ladies and gentlemen, walk this way. 
He's very up and down. 
Okay. Let's play Spot the Forgery. 
- Is that the dog's bollocks, or what? 
- Which one is it? 
Wow, that's brilliant. 
- Max, you've excelled yourself. 
- That is spot on. 
Are you sure the auction house won't spot it? 
The auction house spots it, Mickey can have his £ 15,000 back. 
- Fifteen? 
- Cheap at half the price. 
Any more stunts like that, and it won't be the dog's bollocks... that you have to worry about. 
- You two want to get a room? 
- To do what? 
- I think he's jealous. 
- Somehow I doubt it. 
Now, what happens to the other £ 10,000? 
Take a wild guess. 
Well done, Romeo. 
Okay, what's next? 
There are some things I need to do. 
Why don't you take him and the artwork back to the bar? 
" Him"? 
I am here, you know. 
What can I possibly do without the artwork? 
Yeah, you tell me. 
I tell you what, why don't you stay with her, yeah? 
I'll go and pick the stuff up. 
Okay, watch my lips. 
We stick together. 
You got it? 
Anyway, I am really not in the mood for Eddie's whining. 
Eddie? 
Wait. 
Eddie put you on to us. 
Eddie? 
Eddie, Eddie's Bar, Eddie? 
Eddie did this. 
I'm gonna kill him, I will kill him. 
Get over it. 
Eddie's just saving his skin, like you. 
He's nothing like us. 
God, you really overdo the whole" honor among thieves" business. 
I mean, want to do the honorable thing, go straight. 
That's good, isn't it? 
That's good, coming from a bent cop. 
- I don't pretend there's any honor in it. 
- That's because you can't. 
I'll just check if there's any mail for me. 
You running a bit late, ain't you? 
How's Max? 
- The forgery okay? 
- Ash. 
- Who's she? 
- Detective Inspector Phillips. 
- Eddie sold us out. 
- Eddie? 
Who told you that? 
No, she's lying. He wouldn't. 
I mean, not Eddie. 
Are these the blueprints for the auction house? 
Think of me as your silent partner. 
How are you handling the CCTV? 
Security system's due for its quarterly service. 
That includes the CCTV. 
I'll rig the tapes so they will be running, they just won't record anything. 
Is that the modified case for switching the artwork? 
Yeah. It's good to go. 
The back of the frames match the case. 
Now, while Mickey distracts everyone... you press the other side of the case against the original... you clip it on, you flip the case over... the forgery releases, and off you go. 
Yeah, piece of cake. 
Piece of cake. 
You will have security down on you like a ton of bricks. 
Listen, maybe you should do it. 
Yeah, does everyone want to chill out, okay? 
I'll do it, okay? 
I'm going to do it. 
- You just look after your end. 
- No one's worried about my end. 
Mickey, maybe you should find yourself a nice girl and all that will change. 
Been a while, has it, Mickey? 
Yeah, what can I say? I'm very choosy. 
You need to get down to the auction house. 
Yeah. I will call when I've rigged the CCTV. 
You don't want to set foot in there before then. 
Keep practicing, Danny. 
Next time. Go straight on, all right. 
It's not a problem. 
And distraction. 
Like I said, Mickey, it is a piece of cake. 
Okay, we got to go. 
Yeah, hang on a minute, a little bit of appreciation for that wouldn't go amiss. 
You pull this off, I'll give you an ice cream. 
You all right in the back, Mickey? 
Got enough room for your little legs? 
- Take the next right. - Right. 
You mad? 
It's straight on. 
Turning right avoids the one-way system. 
Take a right. 
Don't listen to him, love, straight on. 
- Actually, where are we? 
- Manor Road. 
Right, yeah, it is right. 
Take the next right. 
Danny, shut up. 
- Why are we stopping? 
- I'll be two minutes. 
- Doing what? 
- We don't have time for this. 
Okay, here's the deal. 
We keep one set of artwork each as security. 
- Are you having a laugh? 
- Why don't we just come with you? 
You wait here. 
I will take the genuine piece. 
Like you said, we don't have time for this. 
Great, thank you. 
Weren't planning on going anywhere, were you? 
No, the thought hadn't even crossed my mind. 
Has anyone ever told you you're paranoid? 
Yep, I will take your phones, too... just in case you were tempted to make any arrangements behind my back. 
I would give it, but I mean, me Nan said she might call today. 
She gets very lonely. 
Yeah, if me Nan calls... just tell her I'll come and see her tomorrow. 
Did you get what you needed? 
It's still there, Danny. 
So, your boyfriend work round here, does he? 
You got a boyfriend? 
No? 
What, you're more of a cat person? 
Hey, stop them! 
Give our bag back, pricks! 
Hey, stop that car! 
Great. 
- You call that running? 
- Yes, I call that running. 
- Where were you? 
- Right behind you. 
- lf I knew you were going to slow down- - 
- Look, it's not my fault. 
- Do not make this my fault. 
- It is your fault! 
You let some idiot take the case and it's my fault? 
- Shut up! 
- I've had it up to here with you. 
- Always got to have things your own way. 
- Let's sort it out now! 
Shut up, Danny, and get in the car! 
Is that supposed to mean something? 
We just got screwed, all right? 
That was the real artwork. 
Do we really have to go through the whole me phoning the auction house... you stopping me at the last minute thing? 
I mean, we can if you like. 
Told you she wouldn't go for it. 
I didn't see you coming up with any better ideas. 
When exactly did you arrange it? 
I left a note for Ash at the hotel, when I checked my mail. 
You can't blame us for trying, can you? 
Yeah, well, I'd probably be more worried if you weren't trying to ditch me, I suppose. 
Here you go. 
Where's he taking the artwork? 
Did you really think we wouldn't find out? 
What's that? 
You're sorry? 
Well it's too late, son, isn't it? 
Did she buy it? 
Let him go. 
I said, let him go. 
Mickey, I'm sorry. 
She was trying to blackmail me. 
She planted some counterfeit money. 
She told me I was going to prison. 
You'll wish you had when we get through with you. 
Mickey, please. 
How long have we known each other? 
I didn't have any choice. 
Danny? 
Jesus, Eddie, you're making me want to kick you. 
I believe we have an auction to go to. 
What about him? 
What you do after I get my money, that's your business. 
We had a deal. 
- You can't do this! 
- Later, Eddie. 
I slipped. 
- A slice of history. 
- And where is it? 
It's not arriving till later this afternoon. 
I didn't expect to get another shot at it so soon. 
- Are you expecting much competition? 
- Only the geek. 
Neil Davis. 
Comic book collector. 
Thinks it's all about the mythology of the characters. 
No appreciation of the artistic significance. 
I mean he couldn't even spell Lichtenstein. 
Then it would be a tragedy if he acquired such an important piece. 
I will just have to make sure that he doesn't. 
Hi. 
You made it. 
Here. 
- You didn't have to do that. 
- Yeah, I wanted to. 
And who's this? 
Is it a bird? 
Is it a plane? 
No, it's.... 
This is Tim. 
Say hello to Neil, Tim. 
He absolutely loves his costume. Wouldn't take it off. 
I wish I'd got one. 
Maybe some other time? 
- Shall we go in? 
- Yeah. 
He's really excited. 
Right, he'll be a while. 
So let's take the weight off. 
So, what is it we are looking at? 
The original artwork for the cover of Black Storm, Issue One, when it arrives. 
And I take it this is a big deal? 
Yeah. 
He was one of the very first superheroes. 
Massively influential. 
Shaped the future of comics as we know them. 
- Wow. 
- I'm bidding for it. 
And who's that? 
Gideon Sturock. 
The competition. 
Looks like a pretentious little prat to me. 
He calls himself an art collector. 
He doesn't care about the characters or the mythology. 
It's just another trophy to him. 
I hope you are not going to let him buy it, then? 
Not if I can help it. 
- The geek. 
- Really? 
Who's that rather attractive young woman with him? 
If she's with a loser like that, probably a hooker. 
I'm very much going to enjoy seeing the look on his face when you outbid him. 
Good work, Ash. 
CCTV's rigged. 
We're on. 
You two go ahead, all right? 
Is there a problem? 
You are about to commit a crime. 
Obviously I can't be associated with that. 
Okay. 
Get yourself a nice a cup of tea, yeah? Sticky bun, all right? 
Danny, I will be right behind you. 
Now, you don't talk to me... you don't acknowledge me, you don't know me... but you stay in sight. 
What time does it start, 3 : 30? 
Okay, is that any good? 
Colossal. 
- What's he doing here? 
- How the hell am I supposed to know? 
- What is going on? 
- Master planner here screwed up. 
The auction house usually have an expert... come in and authenticate the artwork... 
- before they put it up for auction. 
- Yeah, you knew that. 
Yes, I did, but this is not their usual guy. 
The guy they've brought in rumbled us six months ago... when we tried to sell a forged Andy Warhol print. 
Yeah, we had these tins of Spam. 
We'd had them all stacked up. 
They were cute. 
We cannot put the artwork up for auction with him there. 
We are going to have to postpone. 
Just till I'm out of the way. 
Deeply convenient. 
Would you like us to step outside and prove it to you? 
All right, what about Ash? Yeah. 
We will get him all, you know, disguised, he can do it. 
No, he's been servicing their CCTV. 
- We'll have to get someone else, then. 
- Danny, there is no time. Sorry. 
- I'm calling it off. 
- No, we can't rig the CCTV a second time. 
Buyers are ready. 
Everybody's in place. 
Got to go now. 
- I could do it. - Yeah, right. 
I don't think so. 
Yeah. She can do it. 
And watch her disappear with the money afterwards. Are you out of your mind? 
We still make the switch. Yeah? 
We still got the original. 
I mean, that could work. 
I guess you're gonna have to trust me. 
All right, the auction house are expecting a Mr. Henshaw. 
I'll call and tell them that my PA will be delivering the artwork instead of me. 
Wait until I am back in the foyer before you make the switch, all right? 
I don't want to be anywhere near you when you do it. 
Mr. Williams, please. 
Hello, I'm Mr. Henshaw's PA. 
I think you are expecting me. 
So, I understand your own expert isn't in today? 
Paul? 
No, he called in sick this morning. 
We had to get David in here at the last minute. 
- It's authentic. 
- Best get this on display. 
I know Mr. Henshaw has a plane to catch, so I will issue you with a banker's draft... 
- immediately after the sale. 
- Great. Thank you. 
Something tells me you are going to be horribly disappointed. 
We'll just have to see about that, won't we? 
Pretty girl. 
How much does she charge? 
Yeah. 
We're on. 
Mama! 
Kids. Who'd have them? 
I've got four. 
Great, I love them. 
They as good-Iooking as their mom? 
Ladies and gentlemen, if you could please take your seats... we will get today's auction underway. 
We start with the resale of a piece that was purchased two weeks ago... at this very auction house. 
Lot Number One is the original artwork... for the cover of Black Storm, Issue One. 
Drawn in 1934 by Leonard Wright, it's a landmark piece... both culturally and artistically. 
I'll open the bidding at just £ 60,000. 
Sixty. 
Sixty-five. 
Seventy. 
Seventy-five. 
Eighty. 
At £ 80,000. 
Eighty-five. 
Ninety. 
Ninety-five. 
At ninety-five. 
One hundred. 
At £ 100,000. 
One-five. 
One-ten. 
One-fifteen. 
Regret is a terrible thing. 
One-twenty. 
At £ 120,000. 
Any more bids? 
Going once. 
Going twice. 
Don't bid. 
Sold! 
Minus our commission, that's £ 108,000. 
Did you get it? 
- You little beauty. 
- I will cash it and give you your half. 
You know what? 
That doesn't really work for me. 
Excuse me? 
Did she just say what I think she said? 
Fraud, deception, assaulting a bartender. 
I mean you two have racked up quite a charge sheet, haven't you? 
Don't forget you've been with us every step of the way. 
Me? I am an undercover police officer. 
Of course I've been with you every step of the way. 
I mean, how else would I obtain evidence? 
Why don't you just be a good little girl, yeah? 
Hand it over? 
Play nice, Danny. 
Now, same deal as before. 
I keep the money or you go to prison. What's it to be? 
I tell you what, you keep the original artwork, cover expenses. 
Are we supposed to be grateful? 
I really don't care what you are. 
Now I am going to walk out that door, you are going to leave it... ten minutes, then you're free to go. 
What, and you really think that's going to happen? 
Trust me, Danny, you really wouldn't suit prison overalls, mate. 
Me? 
I look good in anything. 
You, I will see around. 
That's a very, very bad move. 
Simply magnificent. 
Excuse me. 
- That's rather odd. 
- What's that? 
Black Storm's wearing a signet ring. 
I don't recall seeing that before. 
Max, we need one identical copy and then another copy with a small flaw. 
A flaw? 
What sort of thing did you have in mind? 
Oh, my God. 
- Wait a minute, where are you, hello? 
- Sorry. 
- Right. 
Okay. - Sorry. 
Miss Jackson. 
It appears that the artwork you put up for sale is, in fact, a forgery. 
The police are on their way. 
Right. 
D.I. Phillips. 
I am working undercover. 
The suspects are still inside, all right? 
We've worked with the police before. 
They've always notified us in the past. 
- We couldn't, for operational reasons. 
- We? Where's your backup? 
I'm working on my own today. 
Why don't we discuss this inside? 
What are you doing? 
I am a police officer. 
Feel good, big man, does it? 
Get your hands off me! 
D.I. Cole, this is D.S. Martin. 
I've been working the inside with this crew for the last couple of months. 
Tell us why you put the artwork up for sale. 
The art expert knew them. 
It was the only way I could get them to go through with it. 
Look, their names are, just remember this, all right... 
Michael Stone, Danny Blue, and Ash Morgan. 
Check Mickey's record. 
Okay. She checks out. 
Sorry. 
Thanks to you, they've got away, and my cover's blown. 
How was I to know? 
The ID and artwork could've both been forgeries. 
So, what's the scam? 
Look, they switched the authentic artwork for a forgery while it was on display. 
- I take it you have CCTV here? 
- Won't help. 
Ash Morgan posed as an engineer. 
He rigged the CCTV, so it recorded absolutely nothing. 
We haven't had an engineer here today. 
I personally authorize all maintenance. 
I would've known if we had. 
Why don't we take a look at it? 
Like I said, it's working perfectly. 
This guy Ash didn't leave the auction room. 
Look, he prepared a fake ID. I mean I saw it, so.... 
Even with a fake ID... there is no way he would've got anywhere near the CCTV system. 
There you go. 
That's them. 
Mickey, the black guy. 
He was using the name Henshaw. 
He bought the artwork from you, like, about two weeks ago. 
That's not Mr. Henshaw. 
Mr. Henshaw's white. 
One-ten. 
It's not the other guy, either. 
There, now, I follow them, okay. 
Go to the camera in the stairwell. 
There are no cameras in the stairwell. 
If the CCTV's working, you will see them switch the artwork. 
Nope, they didn't go anywhere near the Black Storm artwork. 
Wait, you know, they must have. 
I can see you near it. 
- What's happening now? 
- That's nothing. 
Some kid let go of his balloons. 
So the only time we lose sight of the artwork, you're standing right next to it. 
- What's in the case? 
- Nothing. 
It was empty. 
I still had it from when I delivered the artwork for them. 
So, I understand your own expert isn't in today. 
Paul? 
No, he called in sick this morning. 
Okay, I need you to turn the hot tap on in the bathroom while I check it. 
Sorry, pal. 
Where's the case now? 
I gave it back to Mickey and Danny. 
Where were Mickey and Danny when we lost the picture? 
In the foyer, nowhere near the Black Storm artwork. 
You do still have the banker's draft, don't you? 
Yeah, of course. 
The woman and the kid with the balloons. 
So, what's this? 
Maybe we should check this out. 
I've got other evidence. 
Listen, they were running a con on some estate agent. 
Here you go. 
Richard Shaw, all right? 
That's the guy they were conning. 
He will totally back up my story. 
You'd have to be an idiot not to. £ 25,000. 
Richard Shaw. Estate agent? 
I don't think so. 
Look, I can take you to the forger's studio. 
Okay. Let's play Spot the Forgery. 
I told you, they planted the key on me. 
How come the safe deposit box is registered in your name? 
Blueprints for the auction house. 
Research on Black Storm. 
And there's got to be £ 10,000 here. 
What happens to the other £ 10,000? 
Take a wild guess. 
They steered me here. 
But it's your safe deposit box. It's registered to you. 
Yeah, but they knew I'd see the safe depository when we drove past. 
- Actually, where are we? 
- Manor Road. 
Right, yeah, it is right. 
Take the next right. 
They must have known I had a box here. 
And how would they get inside your safe deposit box? 
It's counterfeit. 
What's this, then? 
Eddie. 
She's this bent D.I. 
She caught Billy and his crew gambling down here, you know... they were playing poker. 
She wants £ 10,000, or I lose me license. 
And I could lose everything, Mick. 
- Are you thinking what I am thinking? 
- Yup. 
Is she fit? 
- Okay, I can take you to their hotel. 
- It's not illegal to stay in a hotel. 
- Yeah, but we can get a search warrant. 
- On what grounds? 
Mickey and Danny didn't put the artwork up for sale, you did. 
You collected the banker's draft. 
As far as we can tell, they didn't switch the artwork, either, whereas you.... 
- There's CCTV footage, witnesses. - Look, all this. 
Everything, the lot, okay? 
It's all Mickey and Danny. 
There's no evidence you even spoke to them. 
There's no Max the Forger. 
There's no Richard Shaw. 
This Mickey and Danny don't appear to have done anything illegal. 
At least not today, anyway. 
- Where did all this come from? 
- They planted it. 
- They are setting me up. 
- Can you prove it? 
I don't have any choice. I'm sorry. 
Samantha Phillips. I am arresting you on suspicion of theft, fraud, and deception. 
You do not have to say anything... but it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned... something which you later rely on in court. 
Come on, cards on the table. 
Would you have a little knock-about with her? 
Like I said, Danny, I'm very choosy. 
Yeah, but choosy ain't getting you nowhere. 
When she got that truncheon out, did it for me. 
Women are your kryptonite. 
What are you on about, what are you on? 
Are you tripping or something? 
I'm their kryptonite. 
Albert, I.... 
Listen. 
- Women are powerless to resist me. 
- Yeah, dream on. 
- Right, I'll drive you. 
- No, I'm driving. 
Let me drive. 
Would you open the door for me, please? 
- Want us to do everything, yeah? 
- Thank you. 
I didn't want to drive, okay? 
So I tricked you, so I won. 
You drive, I am not driving. 
Forget it. 
But, Dad. 
- Always a pleasure. 
- Here you go, your first score. 
- Is that all? 
- Shut up. 
- He's learning fast. 
- I'll see you around, guys. 
- Thank you. 
- Nice working with you. 
Come on, let's get you home. 
- Eddie, what happened? 
- I slipped. 
Yeah, I didn't have time to fit the padding before you got to the bar. 
Yeah, I couldn't exactly say anything, could I? 
Grifting's a dangerous game, Eddie. 
But look on the bright side... at least D.I. Phillips won't be bothering you anymore. 
Yeah, nice one. 
Thanks, fellas. 
So, I cashed the banker's draft we got from the auction house. 
The money's in here, along with the £ 80,000... that Neil very happily paid for the original. 
Dangerous, but lucrative. 
So does this mean you lot are going to settle your tab? 
- Eddie. 
- Charming. 
- Where's the gratitude? 
- No appreciation. 
Makes you wonder why we bother. 
All right, then, here. 
Okay then, I'd better be off. 
Hold on. 
Where are you going all dressed up? 
I don't think that's, any of your business, Danny. 
- She's got a date. 
- A date? 
Who with? 
I don't think that's any of your business, either. 
- Neil. 
- Neil. 
Neil? 
You are going out with some specky comic-book geek, when... a beautiful, friendly, funny, sensitive, creative guy... like me doesn't even get a look in? 
Looks that way. 
Doesn't it, Danny? 
Okay, guys, don't wait up. 
Cards, gentlemen? 
Cards? 
Yeah, brilliant. 
I can hardly handle the excitement. 
What? 
Shall we say, a tenner a hand? 
- No. 
No way. 
- Eddie, come on. 
Just a bit of fun. 
Besides, you're one of the crew now. 
So, Eddie, what do you got? 
Like I'd tell you lot. 
- You can't nick the Crown Jewels. 
- Why not? 
Why not? 
I'll tell you why not. 
Because it's unpatriotic for a start. 
Besides which, I don't fancy being banged up... in the Tower of London for the next 300 years. 
- For once, I think Danny may have a point. 
- Yeah, thank you, Stacie. 
What do you mean" for once"? 
If we get caught, they'll throw away the key, won't they? 
Exactly. 
I'm too pretty to go to prison. 
I'll never get any sleep. 
Call me old-fashioned, but I was hoping to avoid getting caught. 
We're talking about the crime of the century. 
There's a band of private collectors who are willing to pay... a small fortune to add the First Star of Africa to their collection. 
- Can we find them? - All in hand. 
The First Star of Africa. 
530.2 carats. 
Also known as the Cullinan I... because it's the largest of the nine stones cut from the Cullinan diamond... discovered in South Africa in 1905. 
It's now set in the head of the Royal Scepter. 
It is priceless. 
Home is the Tower of London. 
There has only ever been one attempt to steal the Crown Jewels. 
And that was by Colonel Blood in 1671. 
- What happened to him? 
- He failed. 
Great, so what are we gonna do? 
Swim the moat or scale the battlements? 
No need. 
The Royal Scepter's being moved... giving us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 
Why is it being moved? 
Right now it's being cleaned by the Royal Jewelers... 
- and after that it'll be moved again. 
- Where? 
The Guildhall Art Gallery is holding a major African exhibition... to coincide with the Commonwealth summit. 
It starts the day after tomorrow... and the Star of Africa is to be the centerpiece. 
All right. 
Think of it. 
The biggest score of this century or the last. 
Something that will be remembered 100, even 200 years from now. 
Everything I know, everything I've learned has been waiting for this moment. 
Nothing this big will ever come our way again. 
The downside is, if we get caught... we all go to prison for a very long time. 
- You all right, Mick? 
You on your own? 
- Yeah, looks that way. 
Cheers. 
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking. 
Really? 
What did you expect? 
You asked them to put the rest of their lives on the line. 
Yes, I did. 
You rolled the dice, they came up snake eyes. 
It happens. 
Yep. 
Just tell me one thing. 
Why? 
Because no one has ever dared attempt anything this big for 300 years. 
- And that's it? 
- For me, yes. 
Look, this is the biggest game in town. 
If we're not here, we're not anywhere. 
I can see that. 
You see, Mickey... 
I had my doubts earlier... but you can count me in. 
Thanks, Danny. 
That's worth a lot. 
But this can't happen without Stacie and Ash. 
Glad to hear it. 
- Was he sulking, Albert? 
- I'm afraid so, yeah. 
- Diddums. 
- I was not sulking. 
Well, it worked, looks like you're getting your own way. 
No, now, wait a minute, come on. 
This thing is far too big for anyone to be here... for any other reason than they want to be. 
You can't bottle it now. 
Cor blimey, first he sulks, now he's trying to back out. 
I'm not backing out, but... if we do this, we do it with our eyes open. 
Hey, if we can't do it... who can? 
- Eddie. 
- On the tab. 
So, is this a change of direction for you boys? 
- You're thieves now? 
- Just trying to earn a living, Benny. 
Tell me about it, there are no honest crooks anymore. 
Everyone tries to screw you. 
Me, I've been screwed more times than a coachload of hookers. 
I see you still have a wonderful way with words, Benjamin. 
Don't talk to me about words, Mr. Stroller. 
Time was a handshake was enough. 
Now, everyone's 14, with spots and rings in their noses... all using fancy words to screw you. 
" Five percent of this. Two pints of that." 
" Ten pence in the pound and pay you next Wednesday." 
- Yeah, it's a different world. 
- That it is. 
Me? 
I've had enough. 
Next year, I sell up. 
Let someone else get screwed. 
So. The great Mickey Bricks and Albert Stroller. 
Call me a Chinaman but my guess is you don't have a bag full of car radios. 
- Not quite. 
- So what is it? 
The Crown Jewels? 
Please tell me you're not serious. 
What we're looking for are a few select private collectors to put in sealed bids. 
- An auction? 
- Winner takes all. 
How long have I got? 
We've found the cleaning company who has the contract for the gallery. 
They employ mostly Eastern European workers. 
- You mean cheap. 
- Precisely. 
And you start tonight. 
Those are the details. 
All right. 
- Hello? 
- It's me. 
- Benny, what have you got for me? 
- It wasn't easy. 
I have to say that personally, I think you're insane. 
But if you pull it off, I've got five bidders lined up. 
All topnotch. 
I knew you were the man for the job. 
Sealed bids will be delivered to your hotel. 
Okay, Benny, I'll be in touch. 
- Well? 
- We are on. 
Thank you. 
That's blinding. 
No. 
- No. 
Believe me, thank you very much. 
- Danny, what are you doing? 
- Premium phone line, 50 quid a minute. 
- What? 
I set up one of these lines. 
Every time somebody phones this number... 
I get 50 quid in me pocket. 
But how are you going to get people to phone the number? 
No, listen, this is where the genius comes in. 
'Cause I don't have to, you see. 
All I got to do, yeah, is I borrow a phone and I call the number. 
Yeah, then they think I'm making a 10p call... but I'm getting 50 big ones in me pocket. 
- Danny. 
- Yeah, Mickey. 
You did stop me using the credit cards. 
- They were very bad copies. 
- But they did work. 
We got thrown out of a restaurant. 
Granted, everyone, but I had a few teething troubles. 
Danny, I would much rather you focused on the job in hand. 
I'm focused, gang, I'm focused. 
This is just a little sideline. 
Make a little bit of money to buy some tobacco when you get us all arrested. 
Eddie, can I borrow your phone, mate? 
Just got to phone me old mom. 
Hello, Mom? 
I'll be watching you. 
- I've just made a pot of tea. 
- Yes, thank you. 
I will just finish my work. 
You'll wear the varnish off, you polish it any more. 
But I want to do a good job. 
Yes, and you'll do a better job with a cup of tea inside you. 
I be five minute. 
Lily. 
- What is happening in there? 
- Some kind of special exhibition. 
All very hush-hush. 
- Practicing a few moves. 
- And the music? 
Get me in the mood. 
- It worked for Tom Cruise, didn't it? 
- Okay. 
I haven't got in the chamber yet, but from what I've seen... they've got motion detectors, lasers, CCTV... pressure pads and a steel door with a time lock. 
- Belt and braces security then. 
- So what's the bottom line? 
It would have been easier if they'd kept it in the Tower of London. 
It'll be okay, we've got Spiderman on board. 
Yeah. 
Let's all have a good laugh. 
Listen, I'll be the only one who's match fit, okay. 
Yeah, there's nothing we can do about the pressure pads. 
We'll have to work round them. 
The biggest problem, though, will be the doors. 
Once they're shut, there's no other way of opening them until the morning. 
- Can we get in any other way? 
- No. 
It's a sealed room. 
- No windows. 
That's why they chose it. 
- Can we tunnel in? 
No, that would set off the motion detectors. 
- And there's no way of bypassing them? 
- Yeah. 
If there is, I haven't found it. 
So what are you saying, Ash? 
We should just call the whole thing off? 
No. 
Just give me a bit more time. 
I'll see what I can do. 
In the meantime... 
I'm late for work. 
Yeah. 
I'm gonna have to call you back. 
Hello, Benny. 
This is an inventory of what was found in your warehouse. 
And this is a list of items reported stolen... in the Greater London area over the past seven days. 
- As you can see they're virtually identical. 
- I bought every item there in good faith. 
In which case you'll have receipts, invoices. 
Names and addresses of suppliers. 
- We had a fire. 
- Oh, yes. 
Of course you did. 
Crime report. 
A container-Ioad of computer equipment... was stolen from the docks three weeks ago. 
They found the container yesterday morning. 
Someone had tried to burn it. 
Kids these days. No discipline. 
The fire went out. 
We dusted for prints... and you'll never guess what we found. 
Perfect match. 
Bang to rights, Benny. 
- How long, Mr. Wells? 
- With your form, fifteen years. 
You take a guilty, you might get 12. 
Well? 
Wait. 
- What about a deal? 
- What kind of deal? 
The imminent robbery of the Crown Jewels. 
- You saw how magnificent- - 
- You said it seven times. 
- No. 
- Mr. Morgan. 
I'm sorry to bother you, only the manager wondered... whether you could bring your account up-to-date? 
- It is rather a lot. 
- Yeah, it is. 
- I didn't have that. 
- You did. 
- Did you have that? 
- I didn't, I don't like- - 
- Who had that? 
- Enough. 
It's not a problem. 
Hey. 
Put your hand in there, mate. 
Keep it in there, I'll get this. 
- Thank you. 
- All right, you're very welcome. 
Listen, love, while you put that through the old switcherooney... 
- can I use your phone? 
- Of course. 
Got to phone me old mom. 
Hello, Mom? 
You shouldn't be in here. 
But I have to do floors. 
Not in here, sweetheart. 
They're bringing other people in. 
I am sorry. 
I can see I'll have to keep an eye on you. Come on. 
Come and have a cuppa. 
You can try my Bourbons. 
- Mick. 
- Hey. 
- How's it going? 
- I've got blisters on me blisters. 
- No gain without pain. 
- Yeah, right. 
Thank you. 
Look, I think I've got it. 
There's a safety feature on the door. 
The time lock's got a panel on the inside, in case anyone gets locked in. 
So can we use that? 
If we can get someone inside before they close it. 
Hey, haven't you lot got any homes to go to? 
- Just a few more minutes, Eddie. 
- Yeah, come on. 
- I need my beauty sleep. 
- Yeah, I'll second that. 
- Do you want a drink? 
- Won't you be lucky? 
Eddie, I just want to say... that I really appreciate you hanging on while Ash and I work something through. 
- Yeah, I know, Mick, but it's really late- - 
- Look, I'll tell you what, okay. 
We'll just have one more drink... and I promise, we'll be out of your hair really soon. 
What do you say? 
Come on, we'll be gone by 1 : 00. 
No, but it's gone on.... 
I could have sworn it was later than that. 
- Go on, then, one more. 
- You're a star. 
Right, come on, tell me about this safety feature. 
Sir? 
- DS Hodges? 
- Yes, sir. 
Your DI tells me you were working on a case last year. 
Michael Stone? 
Look, we had Stone under surveillance. 
But he found out somehow. 
And drafted in another grifter to impersonate a police officer. 
And the case collapsed? 
Stone's man ran the investigation, sir. 
Must have been very embarrassing for you. 
It was embarrassing for the whole department, sir. 
- DCI Mullens lost his job because of it. 
- Did he, now? 
So.... 
Tell me about Stone. 
- Long con artist- - 
- No. 
I know what he does. 
Tell me about the man. 
Mickey Stone is unique. 
He doesn't think like we do. 
You can't second-guess him. 
He gives the impression that he's making it all up as he goes along. 
No. 
But everything is planned, precise. 
- Why me? 
- You drew the short straw. 
I demand a recount. 
So when you gonna push me- - 
He puts together complicated... and seemingly unrelated events, impossible to unravel. 
Waiter, I'll have one of those. 
But all leading to the big con. 
The higher the stakes, the more he likes it. 
Yes, it has been long. 
Just when you think you've got him... 
I've got a job for you. 
Are you sitting down? 
-... you haven't. 
- You sound like a bit of a fan. 
Hardly, sir, he made me look like an incompetent idiot. 
Then how would you like to get your own back? 
Oh, God! 
Sorry. 
I tell you now, I've definitely caught something. 
Okay, this thing isn't going to work unless we can get someone inside the gallery... and in the exhibition room when the doors are locked. 
Once they're locked for the night, the doors can only be opened from the inside. 
- Which is where you come in. 
- How? 
Ash. 
We can get round the pressure pads by going over the top. 
The main problem, though, aside from the time lock on the door... will be the lasers and the motion detectors. 
Like I said, there's no way we can bypass them... and they'll set the alarms off as soon as we set foot in the room. 
- Solution? 
- The only way round it as far as I can see... 
- is to cut the power. 
- Won't that set the alarms off? 
Yeah, but if we do it outside somewhere in the road... we'll knock out the whole street. 
- There'll be alarms going off everywhere. 
- Smart. 
During that time, we'll have 30 seconds to cover up the motion detectors... and get to the door panel to stop the lasers from coming back on. 
- Will that be enough time? 
- It'll have to be. 
Once the genny kicks in, the lasers and everything else will be back on. 
CCTV? 
I can re-route those at source during the blackout. 
- Good. 
- So, what do I have to do then? 
The motion detectors and the lasers have to be disabled from the inside... before we open the door. 
The exhibition has five main exhibitors. 
The biggest of which is Joyce Martin. 
So what is your area of expertise? 
I absolutely adore the Urhobo pieces from the Niger Delta. 
Particularly the Iphri carved figures. 
But, aside from the traditional... 
I've always had a deep affection for some of the more contemporary pieces... such as Bruce Onobrakpeya's epoxy resin etchings. 
Completely stunning. 
Who's been using my phone? 
- Mick, can I say something? 
- Yeah, of course. 
- I've got a really bad feeling about this. 
- How so? 
- I don't know, it just feels.... 
- Foolhardy? 
Yeah, that'll do for a start. 
Ash, this is the biggest thing we've ever done. 
- It was never gonna be easy. 
- Yeah, but there's so much can go wrong. 
I know, but it won't. It won't. 
Okay, say it. 
Don't get me wrong, I'm not criticizing you. 
I think you're a flaming genius. 
- But I have to say what I think. 
- And you think this is a bad idea. 
It's what me gut says. 
Hello, sweetheart. 
New face. 
How you doing? 
Thank you very much. 
Goodbye. 
Bids are in. 
And Albie called, everything is set his end. 
Joyce Martin? 
She's put me in charge of the items going on show at the exhibition. 
So are we good to go? 
Yeah. 
Tomorrow night. 
The diamond, it'll be delivered to the gallery... under armed guard tomorrow morning. 
We know that Mickey Bricks and his team... are going to steal it. 
This is the first time that we've got a head start. 
There is no way they can know we're onto them. 
- We must use that. 
- Okay, we know they're smart. 
So no surveillance. 
I won't risk them getting wind of this operation. 
Which means that we simply watch the gallery... and wait for them to make their move. 
- Does everyone understand that? 
- Yes, guv. 
This team has made us look like fools too many times. 
This time it's our turn. 
I've found a place to cut off the power, but there's a problem. 
- What? 
- I can't be in two places at once. 
At the same time the power is being cut off... someone has to be re-routing the feed to the CCTV cameras. 
Can't you show someone how to do that? 
No, it's best if I do it. 
Someone else can do the electricity. 
- Okay, show Danny. 
- Me? 
No. 
No, I have trouble wiring a plug. 
It's all right. 
I'll talk you through it. We can use walkie-talkies. 
- Okay, I'll do it. 
- Stacie, how you getting on at the gallery? 
I've found a piece that's perfect. 
- Albert? 
- Everything will be ready. 
Okay, the exhibition opens tomorrow. 
So let's get some sleep. 
We'll come in here. 
There'll be four guards in the control room. 
One will be doing his rounds. 
Yeah, there's no set time, so the chances are we'll have to get past him. 
That done... 
Ash will give the signal to Danny to cut the power... which will give us 30 seconds to re-route the CCTV... and for Stacie to do her thing. 
You must get to the door before the emergency power kicks in. 
- Okay. 
- Or you'll be trapped by the lasers. 
When you've done that, we should be on the other side. 
I'd better go. 
- Albert? 
- Second floor. 
And you must be on time. 
We will. 
Any questions? 
- No. 
- Then let's go. 
Thanks for listening, sweetheart. 
Radio silence until further notice. 
Cleaning team. 
On time. 
- You okay, Mick? 
- Yeah. 
Put that back in me bag. 
All right. 
Maybe they're not going to do it tonight. 
Now what do I do? 
- Okay. 
- All right. 
- Come on, baby. 
There we go. 
- All right. 
We're on, Mick. 
Now we'll tape it for a while and then feed the tape through on a loop. 
Okay. 
- Danny, come in. 
- Ready, over. 
Okay, that should be enough. 
Danny? 
Have you got the box in place? 
Hang on. 
Yeah, I got the box in place. 
When you put the clips on, nothing will happen. 
Then after 10 seconds, the power will cut out. 
Take the crocodile clips and clip them both on the- - 
Vinny, where are you, mate? 
I've got a pick up at 19 Chapel Road, West One. 
Hello, you're on my frequency. 
I think you'll find you're on mine actually, darling. 
Just get off the line, you dozy cow. 
Don't you use that tone with me or you won't get a cab. 
I don't want a bleeding cab. 
Just get off the line. 
- Who's that, Mary? 
- Some bloke messing about. 
- Danny? 
- Ash? 
It's always the red. It's always red, isn't it? 
Come on. 
Or is it blue? Is it blue? 
Blue or red? 
Red. 
What the.... 
Good boy. 
Come on, Stace. 
You got 30 seconds. 
12 elephant, 13 elephant. 
16 elephant. 
20 elephant. 
Twenty. 
Twenty-one. 
25, 26 elephant. 
30. 
Shit. 
Good. Okay. 
CCTV returned. 
It's all back up again. 
- All secured. 
- Okay. 
Hello? 
Let's hope Stacie's done her stuff. 
- Right, let's go? 
- Yeah. 
Thank you. 
External power cut. 
It wasn't just the gallery, the whole sector was out. 
Security? 
The emergency power is on and alarms have re-armed. 
What do you want to do? 
Hold your positions. 
I want to know if they're in there. 
What's she doing? 
She should have opened the door by now. 
Something must have gone wrong. 
Come on, Stacie. 
What kept you? 
Watch the pressure pads. 
Everything beyond this point is a pressure pad. 
If we touch them, the alarms go off, all right? 
- You ready, Mick? 
- Let's go. 
Stace. 
Carry on. 
Down. 
Stop. 
Hello, news desk, please. 
Lift. 
Okay, down. 
Stop. 
- Okay, any time now would be good. 
- Yeah. 
One for the scrapbook. 
- That's the cleaner's van again. 
- Shit, they must have been in the first van. 
- Go. 
- Hit the alarms! 
Hit the alarms! 
I knew it. 
- Who the hell are you? 
- I'm with The Times. 
We just received a call about a break-in. 
- Get her out! 
- Yeah, okay, just one minute. 
- How many do you think were involved? 
- Please. 
Any ideas? 
Stay out. 
There's no way they got out through any of the exits. 
The roof. 
Hey. 
Shit. 
Quiet. 
Do you mind? 
Dress. 
They disappeared. 
- Roadblocks? 
- They could be anywhere now. 
Okay. 
- It doesn't matter. 
- What? 
Think about it. 
We know it was them. 
But they have no way of knowing that. 
- Which means? 
- They don't know we're looking for them. 
I will bet you one year's salary... 
- they turn up back at the hotel. 
- They wouldn't be that stupid. 
Why not? 
As far as they're concerned, they've got clean away. 
- I still think they'll be long gone. 
- We'll see. 
Guv? 
Yes. 
Black cab just about to pass you, five people inside. 
I think it's them. 
Hold your positions. 
Wait for my signal. 
That is what I call a great night. 
I don't know about the rest of you, the old man's gonna hit the sack. 
- Yeah, I think I'll join you. 
- Really? 
No. 
I don't mean I'm gonna join you. 
I'm gonna have me own bed. 
- I had no idea you cared. 
- I do care, I love you, Albert. 
- You said you loved me. 
Oh, my God! 
- Shut up. 
Listen, you lot do what you want, all right,'cause I'm gonna get a drink. 
'Cause I've had a very traumatic couple of days. 
Come on, then, I'll keep you company. 
Eye, eye. 
Stand still. Don't move. 
- What's going on? 
- You're all under arrest. 
For what? 
Suspicion of theft. 
I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about. 
Take them away. 
This way, please, sir. 
... it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned... something that you later rely on in court. 
Anything you do say may be given in evidence. 
I'm a friend of the police commissioner. 
If you'd just call him. 
Bang to rights, Mickey, party's over. 
Wait in line. 
I want to speak to my brief. 
In good time, just stand there. 
All right, who's first? 
He's been arrested on suspicion of theft... at the Guildhall Gallery at 10 : 30 this evening. 
- Name? 
- Ashley Morgan. 
- Date of birth? 
- 21 / 7 / 60. 
- Address? 
- The Lexington Hotel. 
Empty your pockets out, will you, please? 
You've forgotten something? 
- Get this developed. 
- Sir. 
Take your tie off. 
Number three. 
Not quite as comfortable as the Lexington, but you'll have to make do. 
All right, who's next? 
Police chiefs have just confirmed... that five suspects have been detained for the theft... of one of the world's best known diamonds, the First Star of Africa. 
The priceless diamond, which usually adorns the Royal Scepter... was recently moved from the Tower of London, to be placed... as the centerpiece in a special public exhibition at the Guildhall Gallery. 
Resuming interview with Michael Stone. 
9 : 13 a.m. 
So, Mickey, you've had a bit of time to think. 
- Yeah. 
- Is there anything you'd like to tell us? 
- Nothing springs to mind. 
- Then I will ask you again. 
Can you tell me again where you were at 10 : 30 last night? 
- It's slipped my mind. 
- It's less than 12 hours ago. 
Yeah, I know, I've got a terrible memory. 
10 : 30? 
I remember. 
No, it's gone again. 
I'm terribly sorry, but my.... 
What's the word? 
Memory. 
It isn't quite what it was, you see. 
What were you saying? 
Any chance of a fag? 
A robbery? 
How thrilling. 
Have you caught anyone yet? 
Thank you, sweetheart. 
Look, I really have no idea what you're talking about, Officer. 
Interview suspended, 9 : 18 a.m. 
- Where's the diamond, Mickey? 
- Is that allowed? 
Where's the bloody diamond? 
What? 
Can I have a word, guv? 
You might think you're clever, but I know you did this. 
And I'm going to put you away. 
- With or without the diamond. 
- Sir? 
I think you better see this. 
It's the film we took from Morgan's camera. 
Testing. 
One, two, three, four. 
Can you hear me at the back? 
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Police Courage Awards. 
Would you please make your way towards your seats. 
And the ceremonies will begin very shortly. Thank you. 
And now the last of tonight's civilian awards goes to a late entry. 
Someone who was brought to the Commissioner's attention... only a few days ago. 
Thank you. 
Waiter, I'll have one of those. 
A man who, without any thought for his own safety... saved the life of a fellow rambler. 
Michael Stone and the man who's life he saved, Daniel Blue. 
I was leaning down. 
There was an injured duck, you see. 
So there I was just trying to help... just help the little fellow, when suddenly, I lost me footing... and the next thing I knew, I was in the water. 
- Why me? 
- You drew the short straw. 
I demand a recount. 
So when you gonna push me- - 
I was drowning. 
Definitely drowning. 
- I can't swim. 
Help. 
- Hey. 
My whole life started flashing before me... 
I'd just left school... and I felt a strong hand pulling me up. 
There he is, there he is. 
It was Mr. Stone. 
He... saved my life. Thank you. 
Doesn't mean anything. 
We've got nothing to place them at the scene and no diamond. 
- They've hidden it. 
- It gets worse. 
We know the diamond was stolen half a mile from the ceremony at 10 : 30. 
The Commissioner's watch. 
It says 10 : 20. 
You've forgotten something. 
That's.... 
That's not possible. 
And then just at the end, they add the little sprinkles on top. 
And that's what makes it a mochaccino. 
- You're free to go. 
- I'm sorry? 
I said you're free to go. 
Okay. It's just come back to me, where I was- - 
Get him out of here. 
Nice to see you again. 
It's been fun. 
It's not over yet. 
You still have to move the diamond. 
And when you do, I'll be there. 
- Where have you been? 
The nice custody sergeant, he let me use his phone. 
Come on, we haven't got long. 
CID. 
Are you sure? 
Okay, thank you. 
Sir. 
We've found the diamond. 
Yes. 
- Where is it? 
- It's still at the gallery. 
Doris, how did we do? 
Five copies as ordered. 
That's great, Lily, just one more, please. 
I don't understand. 
Why go to all this trouble... and not even take the diamond? 
The British government are naturally very embarrassed by this theft. 
So Ml6 has come up with a plan to invent a story to save face. 
They'll say the diamond has been found... and the perpetrators caught. 
They'll then put a replica into the Royal Scepter and replace it in the Tower. 
Yeah, we're expecting the cover-up story to hit the press... some time later today, just so you know. 
So then, all that leaves me to do is to ask you, can I use your phone? 
Thank you. 
Hello, Mom? 
Police? 
I'd like to report the whereabouts of some stolen goods. 
- You got your amnesty? 
- In writing. 
And Benny... 
- enjoy your retirement. 
- I certainly will. 
Oh, ye of little faith. 
You see, it's the perfect con. 
There's no crime, so there's nothing to be arrested for. 
And the only losers are five mugs greedy enough to buy five fake diamonds. 
And when they find out they've been conned... who are they gonna tell? 
There it is, back of the net. 
Right, this is a toast. 
A toast to Mickey Bricks... 
- who is without doubt, a bleeding genius. 
- Worthy of any of the greats. 
I still think he should have told us at the start. 
The risk was the same. 
If you got caught... who would have believed you weren't stealing the diamond, simply moving it? 
Will you take a look at that? 
Nice one, Lily. 
She deserved a bit of luck. 
Yeah, it's beautiful, Ash, nearly as beautiful as the fact... that I've now clocked up 93 minutes on my phone line... which comes to £ 4,500. 
Right on. 
- Hey. 
- Hey. 
- Who paid the bill? 
- Danny. 
- With what? 
- Credit card. 
- Please tell me you didn't. 
- What? 
The police are downstairs... and the receptionist is showing them a credit card receipt. 
So, please, Danny, pretty please with knobs on... tell me you did not use one of yours. 
- We better pack. 
- Danny. 
We've just pulled off the biggest con of the century... and we're sneaking out of a hotel for paying the bill with a bent credit card. 
- Yeah, blame me, why don't you? 
- We do. 
I've had a very rough couple of days, you know. 
All for the good of the team. 
I've been pushed in that bloody canal. 
Nearly drowned. 
I been electrocuted, nearly fried. 
I've had a very harrowing time, I'll have you know. 
- Are you lot listening to me? 
- No. 
- Come on, Albie. 
- I'm coming, I'm coming. 
M really doesn't mind you make a little extra money on the side, Dryden. 
She just prefer if it wasn't sense secrets. 
If this theatric is supposed to scare me, you have the wrong man, Bond. 
If M was so sure I was bent, she would have sent an 00. 
As being section chief, I'd known if anyone had been permitted 00 status. 
- Your file's showing no kills, but it takes... 
- Two. 
We barely got to know each other. 
I know where you keep your gun. 
So I've learned something. 
True. 
- How did he die? 
- Your contact? Not well. 
Made you feel it, did it? 
Well, you needn't worry, the second... 
Considerably. 
So, how do I trust this man that I've never met with my money? 
They ask for the introduction. That's all my organisation will garuantee. 
I suppose our friend, Mr White.. that I've provided the bank services for many other freedom fighters over the years. 
- Do you believe in God, Mr. Le Chiffre? 
- No. I believe in a reasonable rate of eternety. 
- I want no risk on the portefolio. 
- Agreed. 
- And I can access it anywhere in the world? 
- Yes. 
I have the money, so sell my Skyfleet stock. 
Sir, you must know you're betting against the market. 
Noone expect these shares to go anywhere else but up. 
Just do it. 
Looks like our man. 
Burnt scare on his fist. 
I wonder if bomb makers are insured against this. 
He is on the move. 
He's heading straight on me. - Stop touching your ear. 
- Sorry? 
Put your hand down! 
Toss that bloody weapon, I need him alive. 
Listen to me. 
Wheeping blood comes from a disarrangement of the lachrymal duct. 
I have two pairs, and you have a 17,4 % schance of making a Straight. 
BRITISH GOVERNMENT AGENT KILLS UNARMED PRISONER 
When does Ellipsis expire? 
We have less than 36 hours... 
No, no, that's all the time I have in, mate. 
Let our guests have 5 minutes to leave. 
Who the hell do they think that they are? 
Even the Prime Minister is smart enought to not ask questions about what we do. 
Have you ever seed such a buch of self rightous ass covering frings? 
They don't care what we do, they only care about what we get photographed doing. 
And how the hell could Bond be so studpid? 
I give him 00 status and he celebrates by shooting up an embassy. 
And where the hell is he? 
In the old days, when they did something that embarassing, they had the good sense to defect. 
Christ, I miss the cold war. 
- You got a bloody cheek. 
- Sorry. 
- I'll shoot the camera next time. 
- Or yourself. 
Yoy stormed into an embassy. You violated the only absolute rule in international relationships. 
And why? So you could kill a nobody. 
We wanted to question him, not to kill him. 
For God's sake, you're supposed to display a sense of judgement. 
I did. I thought to extinct a bombmaker would be a good thing. 
One bombmaker. 
We're trying to find out how an entire group of terrorists are financed, and you give us one bombmaker. 
The man isn't even a true believer. He is a gun for hire. 
And thanks to your over developed trigger finger we have no idea of who hired him or why. 
- And where the hell did you find out where I lived? 
- Same way I found out your name. 
- I had no idea what M stood for... 
- Utter one more sylabelle and I'll have you killed. 
I knew it was too early to promote you. 
And I understand 00's have a very short life expectancy 
So your mistake will be very short lived. 
Bond, this is maybe too much for a blunt instrument to understand. 
- but arrogance and self awareness seldom go hand in hand. 
So you want me to be half munk and half hitman? 
Any munk can kill. 
I want you to take your ego out of the equation. 
And to judge the situation dispassionately. 
I have to know if I can trust you.. and to know that you know who to trust. 
Since I don't know that, I need you out of my sight. 
Stick your head in the sand and think about your future. 
Because these bastards want your head, and I am seriously considering feeding you to them. 
And Bond... 
Don't ever break into my house again. 
Good day sir, welcome to the Ocean Club. 
Hello? Are you going to take this, or make me wait? 
Sorry sir, sorry sir. 
Welcome to the Ocean Club sir, checking in? 
Yes. It's a last moment, but do you have a room? 
- We have an ocean view villa. 
- Perfect. 
Could you do me a favour, I was at a dinner last night, and I parked my car next to a beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.... 
- and I'am ashamed to say that I nicked the door and.. 
Mr. Dimitrios. 
If it isn't noticed, I'm not sure I would mention it. 
But if I felt contempt to find him.. 
He has a house just up the beach. 
Thank you. 
- What? - He is in the Bahamas. 
You want to share his holiday plans? 
He is logged into our secure web site using your name and password. 
How the hell does he know these things? 
I'll do my best to find out. 
- Who's he looking at? 
- Alex Dimitrios. That slimy bugger. 
No known associates. 
Le Chiffre. 
Have a good night club, gentlemen. 
- What shall I serve? 
- Good evening. A vodka martini. 
Sharp, big boy. 
- Mind if I join you? 
- Small blind. Big blind. 
- I'm in. 
That's to you. 
If that's for luck, you're twelve late. 
- Left to you? 
- I heard you. 
- Check or bet. 
- Check. 
- And you? 
Five to call. 
- Check. 
- Check to you, sir. All in. 
No, wait. 
- 20.000. - Table sticks, I'm sorry sir. 
This is on the table. that's my car. 
You'll bet? Sorry, mr. 
Dimitrios. 
All right, show me, gentlemen. 
Three kings. 
Triple aces. 
Aces win. 
Oh, and the valet ticket. 
- Thank you. 
- Thank you, sir. No wonder he was such a phoney. 
- My mistake. 
- Can I give you a lift home? 
Oh that would really send him over the hills. 
- I'm afraid I'm not that cruel. 
- Or you're just out of practice. 
- Perhaps. 
- What about a drink at my place? 
Your place? Is it close? 
Very. 
One drink. 
- Good evening sir, and welcome back. 
I have a hard time seeing this is my fault. 
It's your plan, all I did was get you the man. A man under surveillance by the British Secret Service. 
- Which makes me wonder if I can trust you at all. 
- So don't, I couldn't care less. 
But I do care about my reputation. 
I have someone else for you to do the job. He just needs the particulars. And payment. 
You like married women, don't you James? 
That keeps it simple. 
What is it about bad men? 
You.. my husband.. I have so many chances to be happy so many nice guys. 
Why can't nice guys be more like you? 
They would be bad. 
But so much more interresting. 
What makes your husband a bad man? 
His nature, I suppose. 
- The nature of his work? 
- A mystery I'm afraid. I'm also afraid you sleep with me in order to get to him. 
- Are you afraid? 
- Not enough to stop. 
Can I ask you a personal question? 
No, won't seem like the properiate time. 
Does Ellipsis mean anything to you? 
- Should I ask him about it? 
- Perhaps later. Yes, dear? 
Ok, I understand. 
See you tomorrow, bye bye. 
Apparently, he's on the last flight to Miami. 
So you have all night to question me. 
In that case we'll need more champagne. 
- Good evening, room service. 
- Good evening. Can I have a bottle of Bollinger, La Grand Annee - 
- And Beluga caviar? 
- Yes, with everything. 
- Would that be for two, sir? - What? 
- No, for one. 
Wait here. 
Hello? 
- Yes? 
- It's Bond. - I need her now. 
- I'm afraid she can't be disturbed. 
Can I take a message? 
Listen, you go and find her, tell her to call security at Miami airport, because I think that a bomb is about to go off. 
Can you do it now? 
I can put you on hold. 
Bond? What the hell are you up to? 
I call you back. 
- A Skyfleet S570 prototype. 
- What about it? 
Largest airplane in the world, to be revieled today at Miami airport. 
Bond? 
His target is the Skyfleet prototype. 
It's launching today. 
I got to go. 
I'm sorry, I'm not sure how much you've lost 101.206.000 dollars. 
Quite a body pile you're stacking up. 
She was tortured first as you already killed her husband, she must have been the only one left to question. 
- Did she know anyhting compromising? 
- No. 
- Your name, what you're after? - No. 
Dimitrios was the middle man, he knew how to put his hands on weapon, and people to use them. 
Hw worked for anyone who had money. 
He was involved with a man called Le Chiffre, a private banker for the world's terrorists. 
He invested their money and gave them access to it wherever they want it. 
Og good, you're here. 
Albanian we believe, chess protegy, mathematical genious, likes to show it by playing poker. 
- So you can keep an eye on me? 
When they analyzed the stock market up to 9.11, the CIA discovered a massive shortage of airline stocks. 
When the stock hit the bottom on 9.11, somebody made a fortune. 
The same thing happened this morning with Skyfleet stock, or was supposed to. 
With their prototype destroyed, the company would have been a bancrupcy. 
Instead, somebody lost over 100 million dollars betting the wrong way. 
You think this man was Le Chiffre? 
Which would explain how he could set up a high stakes poker game at Casino Royale in Montenegro. 
10 players, $ 10 million buy in, $ 5 millioner re-buy 
Winner takes all, potentially $ 150 millions. 
Good, then we know where he'll be. 
Do you want a clean kill or do you want to send a message? We want him alive. 
Le Chiffre doesn't have a $ 100 million to loose. 
He played the stock market with his client's funds? 
They won't be too happy when they find out it's gone. 
We can't let him win this game. 
If he looses, he has nowhere to run. 
We'll give him sanfry in return for everything he knows. 
I'm putting you in the game. Replacing someone playing for a syndicate. 
According to Villiers, you are the best player in the Service. 
Thust me, I wish it wasn't the case. 
I would ask you if you could remain emotionally detached. 
- But I know that's not your problem, is it Boond? 
Don't worry about keeping in touch. 
We know where you are. 
You can stop pretending. 
You knew I wouldn't let it stop, didn't you? 
When I knew you were you. 
I am the money. 
Every penny of it. 
The treasury has agreed to stake you in the game. 
Vesper. 
I hope your parent had it for that. 
Thank you. 
You must be well connected, I've never seen so much be done so quickly. 
Or so stylishly. 
- May I ask you where it is? 
- $ 10 millions was wired to your account in Montenegro. 
With contuingency for 5 more, if I deem it a good looking investment. 
I suppose you've given some thought to to the notion that if you loose, our government would have directly financed terrorism. 
So you're telling me it's a matter of probability? 
I was worried it was some chance involved. 
You'll never see the player with the best hand win. 
So that'll be what you call bluffing. 
You've heard the term? 
Then you'll know that in poker you never play your hand, but the man a across from you. 
- And you are good at reading people? 
- Yes, I am. Which is why I've noticed an undertone of sarcasm in your voice. 
- 
- You don't think this is a very good plan, do you? 
- So there is a plan? 
I got the impression we were risking millions of dollars and houndreds of lives in a game of luck. 
- What else can you advice, mr. Bond? 
- About you, miss Lynd? 
Well, your beauty is a problem. 
You worry you're not being taken seriously. 
Which is what you can say of any effective woman with a heart and brain. 
True, but this one overcompensates by wearing slugging masculine clothing and being more aggresive than her female collegues. 
And ironically enough, and makses it less likely for her to be accepted and promoted by her male superiors, and mistake it a curtesy for arrogance. 
Now I'd normally go with" only child", but - 
- I would go for" Orphan". 
All right. 
By the cut of your suit you went to Oxford, naturally thinking that human beings are dressed like that, but you worried it was demanded. 
My guess is that you didn't come from money, and your school friends never let you forget it. 
Which means that you were at that school by the grace of someone else's charity. 
And since you first thought of me being as an orphan, I would say that you are. 
And you are? 
I like this poker thing. 
And that makes perfect sense, since MI6 looks for an adjusted young man who gives little though to sacrificing others in order to protect queen and country. 
You know, former SAS types with easy smiles and expensive watches. 
- Rolex? 
- Omega. 
Beautiful. 
Now, after having first met you, I wouldn't go as far as calling you a cold hearted bastard. 
But it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine that you think of women as disposable pleasures, rather feminine pursuits. 
So as charming as you are, mr. 
Bond, I will be keeping an eye of our government's money and off of your perfectly formed ass. 
- You noticed? 
- Even accountants have imagination. 
- How was your lamb? 
- Stewed, my symphatys. 
- Good evening, mr. 
Bond. 
- Hotel Splendide, sir? 
- Thank you, sir. 
- Thank you. 
It's last minutes details. 
Apparently, we're very much in love. 
- Do you usually leave it to the porter to tell you this sort of things? 
- Only when it's a necessary brief. I am mr. 
Arlington Beach, a professional gambler. 
And you are miss Stephanie Broadchest... 
- You have to trust me on this. 
- You know I don't. 
We've been involved quite awhile, hence the shared suite. 
But my familiy is strict roman catholic, therefore for prudence's sake it will be a due two bedroom suite. 
I do hate it, when religion comes between us. 
Religion and a securely locked door. 
- Am I going to have a problem with you, Bond? 
- No, don't worry, you'rfe not my type. 
- Smart? 
- Single. 
- Welcome to the Hotel Splendide, what is your name, sir. 
- James Bond. 
You'll find the reservation under" Beach". 
- Welcome, mr. Bond. 
- You sign right there, you represent the treasury. 
- Thank you, enjoy your stay. - I will. 
Very funny. 
Look, Le Chiffre know I'm well connected, he also knows who I am and where the money is coming from. 
Which means he has decided to play me anyway. 
He is either desperate or he is overly confident, He is either desperate or overly self confident. 
But either way, that tells me something about him. 
And all he gets in return is a name that he already has. 
You know he knows something about you. 
He knows you are reckless. 
Take the next one. 
It isn't room enough for me and your ego. 
- Mr. Bond, this is for you. 
- Thank you. 
I love you too, M. 
Rene Mathis. I am your contact here. 
- Does he know we have been watching him? - Le Chiffre? I don't think so. 
Probably because there is no" we". 
Just me. 
I'm afraid if you get into trouble here, recovery won't come over the next hill. 
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday. 
I've spent the time reestablishing old relationships. 
The clef of police is here now, very close. 
It is him, with the mustache, over my left shoulder. 
- That can make life quite difficult. 
- And quite possible shorter. 
He is not a very subtile man. 
I thought about buying his services, but but quite franky, I couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre. 
I hate to say it, but the accountants seem to be running MI6 these days. 
Not that I have anything against accauntants. 
Many of them are lovely. 
So I decided it was cheeper to supply his deputy with evidents that we were bribing the chief. 
It's amazing what we can do with Photoshop these days, isn't it. 
I think your odds are improving, mr Bond. 
- Yes? 
- For you. 
Something you expect med to wear? 
I need you to look fabulous, so when you walk up behind me and kiss me on my neck, the players will think about your neckline and not their cards. 
Do you think you can do that for me? 
I'll do my best. 
Thank you. 
- I have a dinner jacket. 
- There are dinner jackets and there are dinner jackets. 
This is the latter, and I need you looking like a man who belongs at that table. 
How... 
- It is tailored. - I sliced you up when we met. 
- Good evening, sir. 
Thank you. 
Then you must be mr. Bliss' replacement. 
Welcome, mr. 
Or is that Bond? 
I am a little confused. 
Oh, we wouldn't want that, would we? 
Monsieur Mendel. Please sit down. 
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

Dry Martini. 
Wait. 
Three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of China Lillet. 
Shake up, add some ice and a thin slice of lemon. - Yes, sir. 
- Bruno, I'll have one of those. 
- So will I. - Certainly. 
Fred, bring me one as well, and keep the fruit. 
That's it? 
- Anyone wants play poker now? 
- One's in a hurry. 
Will you excuse me. 
- Taste nice 
- I thought we dispenced the covers. 
No, we dispenced with one that was of no use and created another that is. 
- Is he watching? - Yes. 
This is mean character, pissed off because you're loosing so fast we won't be here past midnight. 
I'll bring my character's feelings mirror my own. 
You know that's not half bad. 
I must come up with a name for that. He was worth it. 
To discover his talent. 
- What do you mean? 
- The twich he has to hide when he bluffs. 
He had the best hand. 
- Which he got on the last card. 
The odds against was 23 to 1 and he knew that. 
When he did his first raise he had nothing. 
Then it was blind luck. 
You got the bug? 
Yes. 
Thank you. 
Maybe he can fix his deposit half. 
Ladies and gentlemen. Mesdames et messieurs. We have now been playing for 4 hours. 
It's time for a short break. 
We will resume play in one hour. 
Well, I think I will report about the evenings" florentines". 
- Sir. - You wanted to do what to me? 
- You've lost me completely. 
- You said you couldn't wait to have me back in the room. Come on. 
So what's so damned important? 
I'm so.. 
Where is my money? 
- Good evening. 
- You're holding a parcel for me? 
Thank you. 
You think you can loose that kind of money and no one will notice? 
You money is safe. 
Open that. 
You'll have it tomorrow. All of it. 
I will take a hand for this treason, but you need to use yours. 
Hold out your arm. 
Hold out your arm, my beaty. Or I'll take your head. 
Go to the room. Wait for me there. 
Stairs. 
Not a world of protest. 
Should find a new boyfriend. 
Go find Mathis, tell him I've hidden the bodies down here, and I want him to get rid of them. 
Do that now. 
Go. Go! 
You've changed your shirt, mr. Bond. 
I hope our game doesn't make you transpire? 
A little, but I don't consider myself in trouble until I start wheeping blood. 
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's ready, let's continue the game. 
The blood on my hands are not coming off. 
May I see. 
That's better? 
- Cold? 
- Any trouble with the bodies? 
- Not at all. 
Being dead doesn't mean one still can't be helpful. 
Le Chiffre will keep looking over his shoulder, wondering who it will come from next. 
How is our girl? 
Melted your cold heart? 
- Fold. - Fold. And fold. 
Three players.

Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

Please, we now break for one hour. 
When we return, big blind will be $ 200.000. 
I'm gonna need the other $ 5 million to buy me back in. 
I can't do that, James. 
Look, I made a mistake. 
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant, but I can beat him. - I'm sorry 
- Sorry? 
Sorry? 
Why aren't you putting that in a sentence, like maybe," sorry that Le Chiffre wins, continuing terrorism and killing innocent people." 
You lost because of your ego. 
And your ego can't take it. 
- All you're going to do now is loose more. 
- I'm sorry? 
- I said you're a bloody idiot. 
Look in my eyes. 
You know that. Put your hand off my arm. 
- Vodka Martini. - Shaken or stirred? 
Do I look like I give a damn? 
- James, get the girl. 
Sorry, I should introduce myself since we seem related. 
A brother from Langley. You shall have a little faith. 
You keep your head above you, I think you have him. 
Had. 
Excuse me. 
- You're not buying in? 
Listen, I'm bleeding chips. 
I'm not gonna last much longer. 
You have a better chance, I'll stake you. 
I'm saying I'll give you the money to keep going. 
Just one thing. 
If it bought off, the CIA brings him in. 
And what about the winnings? 
Does it look like we need the money? 
Shall we up the blinds? 
Why not.

Stay calm, don't interrupt, you will be dead within two minutes uness you do exactly like I tell you. 
- I'm all ears. 
- Remove the defillibrator from the couch. 
- Do we know what it is yet? 
- We're still scanning. 
Attach the leads to your chest. 
Ventricular takykardi - digitalis. 
What did they give him? 
- As soon as it reads charged... the button... 
- Don't push the red button! 
- You hear me, don't push it yet. 
There is time for only one charge. 
Take the blue combi pen, Bond. Mid neck. Into the vein. 
You will pass out in a few seconds, push the red button now, Bond! 
- Bond, push the red button. 
- Do it now! 
- You ok? 
- Thank you. 
- You're welcome. 
Take a trip to the hospital.

- He is all yours. 
- I appreciate it, brother. 
Congratulations. 
- You know it is no celebration in it. 
- You were almost dead an hour ago. 
Come on, I'm finished. 
Mathis says the americans have contacted Le Chiffre. 
They think to extract him before dawn. 
You know, I think I would call that a Vesper. 
- Is it the after taste? 
- No. Because once you have tasted it, that's all you want to cook. 
- That was quite a good line. 
- That's a very good line. 
- But you're laughing at it. 
- Not so much because of you. 
Well, that's fine. 
I'll figure out what that is. 
- It's an algerian love knot. 
- Really? - I thought it was just pretty. 
- No. 
Someone gave it to you. 
He is a very lucky man. 
You can switch off so easily, can't you? 
Doesn't bother you killing these people? 
I wouldn't be much if I did. 
I don't believe you. 
You got a choice you know. 
Just because you've done something, doesn't mean you keep doing it. 
Why is it people who can't take advice also insist giving it? 
Are you thinking I don't take my own advice? 
I think something is driving you. 
And I think I'll never find out what it is. 
Mathis needs me. 
Good night. 
Congratulations again. 
Mathis. 
I'm afraid your friend Mathis, is really... my friend. 
Bond... 
You've taken good care about your body. 
Such a vaste. 
You know, I've never understood these levelled tortures. 
It's the simplest things to cause more pain than a man can possibly enjoy. 
And of course, it's not only the immediate pain, but the knowledge that if you don't give up quickly enough there will be not much left to define you as a man. 
The only question remains... Will you give up in time? 
I want the money. 
Miss Lynd will give me the account number, if she has not already. 
So all I need from you is the password. 
The password.. please. 
I've gotten an itch.. down there. 
Would you mind? 
To the right, to the right, to the right. 
You are a funny man, mr. Bond. 
Yes, yes, yes! 
Now the whole world's gonna know that you died while scratching my balls. 
I died? 
I died...? 
Yes, because no matter what you do, I'm not gonna give you the password which means that your clients will hunt you down and cut you in little pieces of meat while you're still breathing. 
Because if you kill me, there will be nowhere else to hide. 
But you are so wrong! 
Because after I've slaughted you and your little girlfriend your people will still welcome me with open arms. 
Give me the password. And I will at least let her live. 
Do it soon enough, she will still be in one peace. 
- You really arn't going to tell me? - No. 
So I think... - 
- I will feed you with what you have undone. 
I'll get the money. Tell them, I'll get the money. 
Money isn't as valuable to our organisation as the ability to trust. 
Any ideas? 
- Why he left the two of you alive. 
Where is she? 
Sleeping. 
And I'm supposed to make you drink this. 
It's just odd. Killing all, but leaving you and her untouched. 
Almost like someone tried to tell us something. 
Did you look at the killer? 
No. 
Shame. 
Drink up. 
Anything else you remember? - Anything else that can help us? 
- Help us? 
Or help you? 
- Hello. 
- Hello. 
You're all right? 
I came just to waking you. 
You're always looking at me like you haven't seen me in years. 
Makes me feel reborn. 
If you've just been born would you be naked? 
You have me there. 
You can have me anyway. 
I can? 
Yes, here, there, any way you like. 
- Does this mean that you will make love to me? 
- Yes, that's how I would describe it. 
Not long ago, if you described your feeling about me not long ago.. 
.. I'm trying to find a better word than" nobody". 
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman. That's something to be afraid of. 
Hello. 
Perfect timing. 
Mr. Mendel, how are things in Switzerland? 
My apologies. 
I do not mean to rush, but a $ 120 million is a large sum of money. 
It certainly is. 
You didn't bring anyt chocolate with you? 
I'm afraid not. 
If you would type in the account number, 
- And then the password 
- You can do that. 
I would if I knew what it was. 
V... E... S... 
The account has been transferred. 
Sorry to disturbing you. 
- Auf wiedersehen. 
- Auf wiedersehen. 
You know, James? 
I just want you to know that if all that was left of you... was your smile and your little finger... you would be more of a man than anyone else. 
That's because you know what I can do with my little finger. 
- I have no idea. 
- But you're aching to find out.. 
You're not going to let me in there? 
You got your armor back on. I have no armor left. 
You stripped it from me. 
What there is left of me. 
Whatever is left of me.. 
Whatever I am.. 
I'm yours. 
M won't miss me for a couple of days. 
- She'll be too busy sweating Mathis. - Mathis? 
Remember, what I told you about Le Chiffre, Mathis told Le Chiffre. 
That's how he won me out. 
The same goes for the implant, I'm not going to miss that. 
- I can't believe that. - Neither could I. 
I thougth he hid my back. 
But there you go. 
Does everyone have a toll? 
Yes, everyone. Everyone except you. 
That's why I love you. 
Do you love me? 
Enough to float around the world with you, until one of us must find an honest job. 
But I think that's gonna be you, because I have no idea what an honest job is. 
Are you serious? Like you said... 
If you do what I do for too long, then there'll not be any soul left to salvage. 
I'm leaving with all that I have left. 
Is that enough for you? 
No stop, I've gotta go to the bank. What's the time? 
How much do you think we need to float for a month? 
I got plenty. 
I want to pay for my half. 
You stopped wearing your necklace. Yes. It was time. 
Time enough to look after the soul? 
You realize that one cannot always forget the past. 
Apparently not for your employer. 
Back in one month. 
Come on, I get money, you get supplies. 
Be back here in half an hour. 
- Hello, M. - I got your note. 
- Yes? 
- We'll talk about that later. 
Right now I have a man from treasury here. 
He wonders if you ever is going to deposit the winnings. 
That's a shame, I didn't think they'd miss it. 
Yes. 
I told them not to worry. - So you'll deposit today? 
- I'm on my way to the bank right now. 
James Bond for mr. 
Mendel. 
Mr Mendel, I have some trouble accessing the funds of my account. 
It was transferred to the bank account number your company gave us, mr Bond. 
It appears the money is being drawn as we speak. Where? 
The Venece branch of course, at St. Mark's Square. 
Is there a problem, mr. 
Bond? 
- I'll kill her! 
- Allow me. 
I'm sorry, James. 
She had a boy friend, a French Algerian. 
They were vey much in love. 
He was kidnapped by the organisation behind Le Chiffre. 
And they blackmailed her and wanted to kill him, unless she cooperated. 
We should have picked up on it, but sometimes we're so focused on our enemies, we forget to watch our friends. 
How are you doing? 
She left her cell phone. 
She must have known I'd check it. 
She knew you were you. - Well, at least this clears Mathis. 
- No. - No? 
- No, it just proves that he's guilty, not innocent. 
Could be a double blind. 
- You don't trust anyone, do you, James? 
- No. 
Then you've learned your lesson. Come back as soon as you can, we need you. 
Will do. 
- If you do need time... 
- Why should I need more time? 
Job's done. 
The bitch is dead. 
James? 
Did you ever asked yourself, why you weren't killed that night? Isn't that obvious? 
She made a deal to spare your life in exchange for the money. 
She hoped they would let her live. But she must have known, she had to have her death. 
And now we'll never know who was behind this. 
The trail's gone cold. 
- Hello? 
- Mr. White? We need to talk. 
Who is this? 
The name is Bond. 
It was an era plagued by widespread turmoil treachery amongst government officials and a bitter struggle for power winthin the imperial family 
Against this backdrop our story begins 
What blessed night is this? 
Drifting down the River Qian 
What auspicious day is this? 
Empress Wan secretly sends her messengers to warn Prince Wu Luan of the assassination and urge his return 
But she is unaware the new Emperor has already dispatched assassins to prevent Prince Wu Luan's return 
Trees live on mountains and branches live on trees 
My heart lives for your heart but you do not see me... 
This helmet does not sit well on you 
The kingdom shall not wait 
Seal the door 
Not just your make up but also the way you enter your bath 
Will brother in law let the Prince go free? 
Will you let my hand go free? 
Why did you run all the way here? 
When I was summoned to the inner court 
I thought perhaps the Prince had returned 
Then how do you communicate? 
Through dreams 
I dream of him every night 
And we talk to each other 
Did you dream of him last night? 
What did he say to you? 
He told me not to eat too much sweets 
But then he also said young girls tend to like sweet things it is not really a bad habit 
I also used to like sweet things 
Am I right? 
The tug between power and love has tormented past emperors for centuries 
You do not seem to be tormented 
Before tonight everything was simple 
I cared only for my kingdom 
But after tonight when there is you, sister in law 
You certainly know how to flatter a woman 
I speak from the heart 
Why don't you give away the throne so we can retire to the woods and live like hermits? 
What do you think? 
Sister in law do you want me killed? 
I was only teasing 
If it is my life that you want you can have it 
You can have everything that is mine 
She is about to be crowned Empress again 
By whom? 
Your uncle the new Emperor 
What have you heard? 
Did I come back to grieve for my father 
I have sacrificed more than enough for you and your father 
But my father's spirit still wanders restlessly outside the palace gate 
Empress Mother Look into my eyes and tell me 
Did my father really die from the sting of a scorpion? 
The pain in your eyes breaks my heart 
Promise me? 
The best way to soothe your father's spirit is to make sure we are both safe 
Your Majesty 
Forgive me 
My shabby clothes have soiled the Empress' bathrobe 
Show me what is inside your sword case 
The sword of the Yue Maiden 
When your father first taught us swordplay you were always the better pupil 
She sings this song 
So it is a love song 
When your father allowed you to pursue the arts 
To me, a man should not be a lonely musician a product of warm hills and soft streams 
A proper man is a prince who rules over his kingdom with strength and courage 
That is only your idea of a man, Empress Mother 
But you have responsibilities 
They're bestowed upon you by the heavens above passed on to you by your ancestors expected of you by your people 
Hasn't my uncle assumed these responsibilities in me? 
He... 
The late Emperor was a thrifty man but I am not going to suffer the way he did 
Which glorious dynasty has not been forged with blood? 
Minister Yin Your Majesty 
I envy you for having such a personable and astute son gifted in both cultural and military affairs 
Unlike my nephew your Crown Prince who only knows to sing and dance 
If Your Majesty does not like the snow leopard carving it can be replaced at once 
I like it 
When it snows this creature stays inside the cave to groom his fur 
When the sun comes out, it emerges shiny and sleek it knows about changing with the weather 
This is a clever beast 
May your servant suggest that a tiger would be even more appropriate 
According to the Book of Change a great man descends from a tiger a gentleman from a leopard 
The tiger has an appropriate air of majesty 
Your Majesty 
Why are you silent? 
I was thinking, perhaps this snow leopard should be gifted to Minister Yin 
Why is that? Because he too knows how to change with the weather 
Governor Pei's suggestion is excellent 
We shall bestow on Minister Yin this beautiful carving 
My deepest gratitude to Your Majesty 
As for a replacement... let it be a tiger then 
Your servant Pei Hong bows before the Empress Dowager 
Did you all hear that? 
Yes What does this signify? 
The late Emperor has ascended to the heavens if the Crown Prince succeeds the throne the Empress will become the Empress Dowager 
Thus, I am the usurper 
With three words you have rearranged the hierarchy of the court 
According to our ancestral customs the Emperor kneels to the Empress Dowager as a son to his mother 
But the Empress kneels to the Emperor as a wife to her husband 
Are you the Empress Dowager? 
Or the Empress? 
Should I kneel? 
Please advise us 
Which is the correct procedure? 
Your humble consort kneels before Your Majesty 
Your Majesty 
Late Emperor did your spirit in heaven witness this vile exchange? 
Your Majesty The province of You is now yours to govern 
Pei Hong is condemned to be beaten to death and his entire clan executed 
At once, Your Majesty 
What was it that you said we should carve? 
A flying dragon 
Let it be a dragon and a phoenix 
I am grateful to you 
You don't have to be 
I hereby proclaim the Empress coronation will take place on the fifteenth day of this month 
Your Majesty the traitor Pei Hong is dead 
What do you think you're doing? 
This gift from the Emperor is an insult to father 
She is far too innocent 
I cannot get the eyes of the phoenix right imagine the eyes of Empress Wan 
The Empress' eyes are sometimes soft and charming and sometimes frightening 
A phoenix with a steady gaze is what would please the Empress most 
From now on it is best if you stopped seeing the Prince Why? 
When the late Emperor was alive this match was our family's blessing 
Now that he is gone 
I fear it may be our downfall 
My heart will never change Make it change 
Learn from the Empress 
Who cares about losing a kingdom when in the presence of such rare beauty? 
You can hardly be more secure on your throne 
I can't ruin you anyway 
Qing, why don't you leave us 
The person I do not trust is my dear nephew 
I wonder how his rehearsal for the coronation is going 
Your Majesty this rehearsal adheres to the usual rules only wooden swords are employed 
Please examine the weapons, Your Highness 
Thank you 
We have heard that Your Highness is an expert swordsman Mere childish endeavours 
It is the Emperor's wish that our performance at the coronation should impress the entire court 
Swordplay is always impressive and performance is my specialty 
He... mistook a deadly combat for a show 
And I thoroughly enjoyed the show 
How did you manage to lose so badly today? 
Did you think I lost? 
I hope that you will do better at my coronation 
Why do you wear a mask when you perform? 
But with a mask a great artist can convey to the audience the most complex and hidden emotions 
In that case, what do you see on my simple face? 
Six parts arrogance, three parts disquiet and one part guilt towards your late husband 
You are wrong 
It is disappointment... disappointment in you 
I no longer look to you to fulfill my dreams 
You are incapable of even the most basic play acting 
Your sorrow, anger, bitterness and uncertainty are there for all to see 
You permit danger to follow you everywhere 
You think hiding behind a mask can elevate your art? 
The highest level is to use your own face and turn it into a mask 
What is it made of? 
It's made of Erysipelas from the Northeast ground together with black scorpions of the Northwest 
No 
What can be more lethal than this? 
The human heart 
Any what? 
There aren't any scorpions in the palace 
I hear you brought back a song 
I heard it from the Empress... 
Trees live on mountains and branches live on trees 
My heart lives for your heart but you do not see me 
You think I'm pitiful She pities me too 
Both of you use my suffering to lure me into your embrace 
Is that not the case? 
No 
No I am not her 
I am not her You are her 
You are her 
May the Emperor live ten thousand times ten thousand years 
May the Empress live a thousand times a thousand years 
A performance of swordplay by the Crown Prince Wu Luan and the Imperial Guards 
Uncle 
Empress Mother I wish you both everlasting happiness 
Please forgive me I am not going to play with you tonight 
Instead, I have prepared a play for your amusement 
My dear nephew I have been expecting you 
Won't you take off your mask and let me look at your face? 
Your are covered in sweat 
Come 
Let me wipe them away for you 
No Your sleeves are soaked with Erysipelas 
They reek of black scorpions 
Wu Luan, you are not acting in a play now 
What a talented artist I feel so gratified 
Quickly bow and thank His Majesty 
How much you have grown in the last three years lt's time to take on some serious responsibilities now 
Your Majesty 
What was in the dispatch sent by the Khitans? 
It says that to strengthen the trust between our two nations we should each send our Crown Prince to live in the other's country 
Have they sent their hostage yet? 
But I hear he is in fact the son of a herdsman 
We are a great country and we live by our word 
We shall send a real prince 
Why not? 
His nature is too gentle 
All the better lt will be honed by the sandstorms of the northern deserts 
He is too emotional 
He may offend the Khitan Khan lt appears you are emotional now 
but am I offended? 
Your Majesty's magnanimity is vast enough to embrace oceans 
But I will not tolerate a grain of sand in my eye 
Lord Chamberlain 
Write this down : 
The Crown Prince Wu Luan is henceforth appointed Ambassador to Khitan 
He will be escorted by the Imperial Guards and will depart promptly today 
By command of the Emperor Imperial Guards 
Escort the Crown Prince 
His Majesty is doing this for your own good 
Your Majesties, the Emperor and Empress 
Your servant Qing begs to accompany the Prince 
For what reason? 
So that when he is lonely there will be someone to sing to him 
Lord Chamberlain 
Present 
Take her away and give her thirty lashes of the whip 
Does it hurt? 
My dearest daughter you have to learn to endure the pain 
It hurts too much but I shall listen to you and try to bear it 
Her Majesty the Empress approaches 
Does it hurt? 
No 
Look at you 
Tears are welling up and you still say it doesn't hurt? 
Do you know why I punished you? 
Because you are jealous 
Qing 
Let her speak I like to hear the truth 
And why am I jealous? 
Because I have love 
And I don't? 
You only love yourself 
Nonsense 
Who does not love themselves? 
Let us take him as an example your father 
My father loves my brother and me more than anything in the world 
Really? Let us find out if this is true 
Brand her face then have her exiled to the South 
Your merciful Majesty I always knew that the Minister was a man of wisdom 
Where are we? 
We are 350 miles past the province of You the Khitan boarder is just ahead 
Really? Why didn't you tell me when we passed You Province? 
I should have paid a visit to Yin Sun 
His Majesty commanded that there must be no delay 
Who is that? 
That is you 
The Prince 
The hostage ln which case 
I shall not reach Khitan No, you will not 
When do you plan to kill me? 
Now You think you are capable of killing me? 
It will be either your death or ours 
I am Yin Sun, Governor of You 
Why did you save me? It was an order from that woman 
Her? 
Her 
You follow her orders? My sister is in her hands 
I am sorry 
What will you say to my uncle? 
I shall report that all the envoys were slaughtered by the Khitans 
There is not one single survivor 
But I am alive 
You will have to hide I do not want to live like a mole 
This is only temporary 
Temporary? 
How long is that? 
Three years? 
Five years? 
Or until my hair turns gray? 
It is still better than returning and dying needlessly 
I am not afraid of death But you cannot let other people die because of you 
Will you not be satisfied until my sister my father 
and our entire clan have sacrificed themselves the way these poor guards have done so that you can play at your revenge? 
Will you not be satisfied until rivers flow with blood and the world is submerged in turmoil? 
Looking at this mask what do you two see? 
Destiny at play 
Your Majesty is the true son of Heaven 
Nobody can oppose you 
But if I had not made the right move in time it would have been my blood 
you are staring at now, wouldn't it? 
You seem nervous... is the Minister not feeling well? 
Why are you sweating so profusely? 
Governor Yin 
Your Majesty Your father has worked too hard all his life 
Stay at home and keep him company 
My military duties keep me away from home, Your Majesty 
Your military duties? 
Without you, the sky is hardly going to fall down 
Your Majesty's kindness has moved your servant to tears 
We are most grateful for Your Majesty's consideration 
I have never liked masks 
You may leave 
Yes, Your Majesty 
Lord Chamberlain 
Present 
We shall give a banquet for the entire court The day after tomorrow is an auspicious day for feasting 
That would be too late make it tomorrow night 
Tomorrow is not auspicious for receiving guests 
I will not bow to superstition 
Write this down : 
Tomorrow at midnight all courtiers are invited to a royal banquet to be given in the hall of gold 
Yes, Your Majesty 
Anyone who fails to attend will be executed 
Since the departure of the Crown Prince your sister has not touched a single grain of rice 
Then let me tell her that he is still alive 
No 
Drifting down the river Qian 
What auspicious day is this? 
Dreaming beside my Prince 
I dreamt of him again last night 
He was dancing somewhere white as snow 
There were a lot of people He even invited me to join him 
Little sister stop fooling yourself 
You are not in his heart I know 
But I promised I would wait for him always 
You are in your brother's heart I will not let anybody harm you 
is there anything more poisonous than this? 
Yes 
What? 
Well said 
Why didn't the Prince take it with him on his last visit? 
This is your payment 
Arsenic? 
There is not much but it should be enough for one 
His Majesty the Emperor approaches 
We have not played polo for a while 
Let us have a big match, you and I 
Your Majesty is throwing a banquet tonight ls there enough time to play? 
It is still eraly I have a headache 
Lord Chamberlain 
Present Send for the Imperial Physician at once 
Yes, Your Majesty 
There is no need I just need to rest for a while 
Your Majesty 
Look at you 
An Empress 
Mother to a nation And you still kick off your blankets when you sleep 
Did you catch cold last night? 
How long have we been together? 
Why do you ask? 
including today it would be one hundred days exactly 
You have been counting 
But to me it feels like less than a single day 
One hundred days, but 
I have never surrendered all of myself before 
Even if you are a piece of ice you will eventually melt in my mouth 
What if the ice turns into fire? 
A globe of fire in your mouth 
Then I shall swallow it and it will warm my heart 
Swallow it now 
What did she say? 
The Empress said that her mind was made up the moment the Prince was sent away as hostage 
The Emperor is fickle and suspicious 
She may be his favorite now but sooner or later he will turn his attention elsewhere 
Rather than wait to be discarded she has decided to take the risk and strike first 
She wants to rule herself? 
Exactly 
Once she has succeeded she intends to denounce the Emperor as a fratricide and usurper 
She will say that she is carrying out heavenly justice on behalf of the late Emperor 
She wants us to rally and support her claim to the throne 
This woman 
Ah, this woman 
Father whose side should we take? 
We have no choice, she has planned everything perfectly 
First, your sister is in her hands 
Secondly, when she asked you to save the Prince it was not for personal reasons alone lt was to turn us into her accomplices so that we have nowhere to stand except by her side 
She knows that we have no option now 
If this woman succeeds we must denounce her straight away as a traitor and an assassin 
The person who deserves to ascend the throne is not her but you 
Are you afraid? 
No lf Heaven bestows this gift upon me to refuse would be to disobey the gods 
Ling prepare the carriage 
To the Minister of Law 
Minister Yin and his son, Yin Sun are guilty of the following crimes : 
deceit of the Emperor and tyranny over the court misuse of power and collusion of the enemy 
They will be stripped of their titles and exiled to the South 
All their property will be confiscated and deposited in the national reserve 
By command of the Emperor 
General Yin 
General Yin 
Present l wish to say a few words 
Pour the wine 
Yes, Your Majesty the Empress 
Our ancestors used to roam the palace with candles by night but our most gracious Emperor throws brilliant banquets for his courtiers 
His hospitality surpasses all who came before him 
It is my privilege to thank His Majesty with this toast 
Also tonight I am going to take Your Majesty's life 
Excellent 
Esteemed courtiers 
Let us drink together 
To His Majesty 
Your servant Qing and my dancers beg permission to entertain Your Majesties with a performance 
Minister Yin 
Your Majesty 
Did you organize this surprise for me? 
Your Majesty this is Qing's own idea 
My father knows nothing about it 
Good 
What have you prepared for us? 
A song from Yue 
This sounds familiar lt was the Crown Prince's favorite song 
To commemorate him I want him to know that even if the whole world abandons him I shall never do so and my love for him will never die 
This is very touching 
Grant her some wine 
Yes, Your Majesty 
Take my cup let me join you in remembering the departed spirit of my dear nephew 
Such an honor is too great for Wu Luan 
Let us fetch another cup 
Lord Chamberlain 
Present There is no need 
Thank you, My Lord 
But I do not know how to drink 
You must not refuse His Majesty's gracious gift 
Then I shall have a little sip 
Sister 
What blessed night is this? 
Drifting down the river Qian 
What auspicious day is this? 
Dreaming beside my Prince 
Too bashful to stare 
A secret I cannot share 
My heart fills with longing 
to know you, dear Prince 
Trees live on mountains and branches live on trees 
My heart lives for your heart but you do not see me 
You do not see me 
Qing 
Wu Luan lt's me lt's me 
The moment the song started I could feel you near me 
My dearest Qing 
Your Highness 
do you still feel lonely? 
With you I shall never be lonely again 
Your brother loves you 
No one can harm you 
You poisoned the wine? 
Yes 
You wanted me to die? 
Yes 
And all along I thought I was warming your heart 
It has been heated to the point of burning 
Lord Chamberlain 
Present 
Carry out this edict : 
Qing is to be given a lavish state burial 
Minister Yin 
What are you waiting for? 
You... venomous woman 
Where are the Imperial Guards? 
Imperial Guards 
Protect the Emperor 
Amyone who stands in my way will perish 
This man murdered my father like a coward 
This is a matter between the two of us lt is nobody else's concern I don't want to kill the innocent 
Out of my way 
Such majestic demeanor as befits a nephew of mine 
I knew that if you were alive this day would come sooner or later 
And here you are 
Was it the desire for revenge that hauled you out of the valley of death? 
Or was it your melancholy that touched the hearts of women 
so that their tenderness wove a web of protection around you? 
Or perhaps a million calculations cannot compare with one pure heart? 
Or maybe it is you 
my brother who has been protecting your son all along 
so that he can spill my blood and restore your honor? 
If this is what you want 
Brother 
then let me appease you tonight 
You offered me a toast 
How can I refuse? 
The Emperor is dead 
Your Majesty 
Your Majesty 
Do with me what you will 
Please do not lay this sinful title on me 
Would killing you bring Qing back to life? 
The blade is poisoned 
Wu Luan lt is nothing 
You are going to be fine 
He was lying 
There is no poison 
The blade is not poisoned 
Wu Luan Imperial Physician 
Lord Chamberlain 
Ling, where are you? 
Wu Luan 
Where is everybody? 
Little Wan... 
Little Wan... 
Little Wan is here... 
Your Little Wan is here 
Look at me, look at me 
Your Little Wan is here... 
Little Wan is here lt is so good to be able to die 
You cannot die 
You must not die 
Wu Luan 
May your majesty live ten thousand times ten thousand years 
Long live 
Long live 
Long live Your Majesty 
Minister Yin conspired to usurp the Throne 
By law, he should be executed 
But considering his service to three successive emperors he will only be exiled to the far North and never to return 
By command of the Empress 
Little Wan 
When was it that I started to forget my name? 
Perhaps it was the day your father married me 
You left and nobody used my name anymore 
Gradually even I forgot what it was 
Then your uncle married me 
and again I was called the Empress 
But from now on nobody will call me Empress anymore instead, they will call me 
Her Majesty, the Emperor 
Do you know why I like this particular red? 
Because it is the color of the flame of desire 
Yes desire 
How many lives have been consumed by this flame? 
Only I 
shall rise out of it like a phoenix 
The breathless whisper of a single verse 
And loneliness blossoms within my heart 
The shimmer of a single dream 
And my world is undone 
The memory of a single tenderness 
And the sting of love reignites my wounds ln the moment when a single tear falls 
All hatred becomes a distant blur I can love you with all that I am 
But even this cannot return you to me 
From now on I will live as a shadow 
Forever in the past... 
Forever in the past... 
Excuse me, please. 
Excuse me... 
Excuse me... 
Excuse me. 
Come here, honey. 
So how did it go? 
We went towards the dam, and then... 
How did it go? 
Very well. 
We went towards the dam, and then to the old town. 
You don't like the old town, do you? 
So did you have fun with your friends? 
Did you have fun with your friends? 
And were you a good boy? 
You were a good boy. 
You were mommy's good boy. 
So... how did it go? 
Very well. 
Impeccably. 
- We went towards the dam... 
- But did he feel good? 
Excuse me? 
Did he feel good? Fulfilled? 
He's somewhat of a loner. 
He's anxious. 
He doesn't like the company of other animals. 
No... It went impeccably. He was with other dogs. 
And... they... - talked to each other. 
- That's good. Very good. 
Wonderful. 
Thank you. 
Thank you, madam. 
PRICELESS 
Honey? 
Honey? 
Honey? 
Jacques, I can't believe it. 
Get up. 
Come on. 
Get on the bed. 
- Do you feel well? 
- Very well. 
And you? 
You're completely drunk. 
It took you 3 hours to get ready. 
Look how much you've drunk. 
Don't worry. 
These are little bottles. 
- You could have made an effort today. 
- Don't argue with me, honey. 
I hate it when people tell me the truth. 
Right. 
Don't move. I'll give you a second pillow. 
Thank you. 
In 2 minutes I'll be at your disposal. 
Dammit. 
I'm sorry. 
You look awful. 
- Did you walk the dogs again? - Yes. 
I walked them this morning. 
Why do you accept this work? 
They're so used to me accepting, that I don't dare refuse. 
Besides, I have the time. 
It's not my problem. 
But don't fall asleep in the bar. 
Yes, sir. 
I'm sorry. It won't happen again. 
I'm leaving now. 
- Can you close up? 
- Yes, of course. 
He'll leave if you turn down the lights. 
Excuse me. 
I'd like another one. 
It's good you turned down the lights. - It's nicer this way. 
- Thank you, sir. 
Can you turn on the TV? 
There's a live broadcast on Eurosport. 
Yes, sir. 
Sit down. 
I'm not allowed to leave the bar, sir. 
- Really. 
Except to serve drinks and... in case of a fire. 
- Yes, sir. 
- Sit down. 
Have a cigar. 
Have a cigar. 
The leaves growing on the coco trees in the fields... 
That's what gives them their particular aroma. 
- Do you smell it? 
- Yes, sir. 
Because of the embargo against Cuba, I fly them in by private jet. 
One cigar costs about... 120 euros. 
Good evening. 
I'm sorry. 
This is the first time I've fallen asleep like this. 
Considering the mood here, I don't see anything better to do. 
This place is dead. No. 
It was brimming with life earlier. 
But now it's a bit late. 
It's not normal, that there isn't anyone at the bar at this hour. 
Normally, they aren't allowed to leave before 3 a. m. 
It's forbidden. 
- Unless there isn't anyone. 
- But you're here. 
Yes. 
- And I'm here, right? 
- Indeed. 
Something like this wouldn't happen at the Carlton. 
You know, the Carlton... 
Do you think their service has worsened as well? 
Do you think he'll come back? - Who? 
- The barman. 
I don't know. 
Would you wait with me? Yes. 
Of course, miss. 
it's very nice of you. 
Your cigar smells nice. 
Normally I can't stand the smell, but in this case... 
Yeah, it's... it's because of the leaves, which grow on the coco trees... in the fields 
Really? 
They're flown in from Cuba by private jet because of the... the... 
- Because of the embargo? 
- That's it. 
- Are you alright? . 
- Today is my birthday. 
- Happy birthday, miss. 
- It's off to a bad start. 
I wanted so much to have fun tonight. 
I'd give anything for a cocktail and some music. 
What are you doing? 
- Cocktails are my specialty. 
- Isn't this too risky? 
In the worst case, I'll just say I work here. 
So what would you like? 
I don't know... 
Something that gives a feeling of joy. 
For your birthday I suggest something with champagne. 
And that gets you drunk fast. Gets you drunk fast... 
Then... 
A cocktail with champagne. 
Excellent. Wonderful. 
I love to watch someone work. 
I'm always impressed by people who have specialties. 
I can't do anything. 
Actually I can. I can make conversation. 
And you? 
Right. 
I'll have another one. 
Which floor are you staying at? . 
- Me? 
- Yeah. 
The fifth... 
The fifth floor. 
The imperial suite. 
I only know the royal one. 
- Will you give me a tour? 
- Sure. 
The dressing room. 
Here we have the liv... 
- What? 
- The living room. 
The first bathroom. 
Here we have the study, with a wireless internet connection. 
The bedroom. 
This way, please. 
You must be very rich. 
Why do you say that? 
Must I do everything for you? 
What? 
Happy... birthday... to... you... 
Martine... 
Martine! 
Did they leave the royal suite? 
They left this morning. 
They stole a bathrobe. 
ONE YEAR LATER... 
The coffee, ladies and gentlemen. 
Who'll be having the decaf? 
Excuse me. 
Excuse me. 
Is everything alright? 
Jean, but... 
What are you doing? 
Jean, are you alright? 
Thank you very much, sir. 
I'm not hungry. 
What will you have? 
What you picked. 
Good idea. 
With pleasure. 
- Irene? 
- Yes? 
Happy birthday. 
Thank you, Jacques. 
For the moment. 
And your... uncle? 
You're talking about my grand-uncle? 
He's growing old. 
Will you have a cocktail? 
Just one? 
What the... 
Older people get up early. 
You should know that by now. 
I couldn't sleep at all. 
I went to the beach to get some fresh air. 
I also couldn't sleep. 
And I saw you at the bar with that guy. 
You were tenderly getting some fresh air on the sofa. 
I'm sorry, Jacques. 
I don't know what came over me. 
That was the first time. 
In a few months I'll see you at the same place 
At the hotel bar, wearing a mini, with the same fake expression of indifference. 
I'm not worried. You'll be so drunk you'll ask me my name. 
You'll offer me a drink. 
Dammit. I can't believe it. 
I'm so stupid. 
I left him. 
I left it all for you. 
I left him... 
- Did you forget something? 
- I forgot you. 
Excuse me? 
But... aren't you leaving today? 
- Jean? 
I left him. 
I left it all for you. 
- Really? 
- Yes. 
Tell me I did the right thing. 
You did the right thing. 
I want to spend every hour with you. 
- Do you know what would make me happy? - I don't. 
- A trip to the Maldives. 
- Where? 
You don't know them? 
I do. 
But not all of them. 
But first we'll order a big breakfast. 
When I'm happy I'm also very hungry. 
And this time we'll spend the morning in bed. 
You're not the type of person who works all the time? 
That depends. 
Are you alright? 
Here's the living room. 
And here's a widescreen with sattlelite. 
And here, office, with fax, internet access, wifi, etc. 
Do something. Jean, Jean! 
Jean! 
Damn, what are you doing here? 
Dammit. 
I can't believe it. 
Could you please wait a few minutes in the lounge? 
There must be a small mistake. 
Yes sir, it's a mistake. 
Get out of here. 
In 2 minutes I'm sending Martine to clean the room. 
Damn, I can't believe it. 
I can't believe it's you. 
You've arrived in Nice. 
This is the last stop. 
We ask all passengers to get off the train. 
We ask that you make sure you haven't left anything on the train. The next train will arrive at 2 o'clock. 
Henri? 
It's Irene. 
Irene Mercier. 
We met at that social gathering. 
At the casino in Cannes. 
I'm sorry. 
Yes, of course. 
Maybe some other time? 
My number is... 
Bye. Asshole. 
Dominique? 
It's Irene. 
We met at the VIP club last year. 
You spilled your glass on my dress. 
Yes, Irene. 
Very well. 
For how long? 
Too bad. 
Baire? 
It's Irene. 
It's Irene. 
Single, small but well-proportioned. 
Yes, Irene, that's right. 
Benoit? 
Asshole. 
Philippe? 
It's Irene. 
Don't you remember the meeting in Dauville last year? 
I'm sorry. 
My condolences. 
Are you his son? 
Grandson? 
So we must be the same age. 
What are you doing here? 
Reception told me you asked for the schedule of trains to Nice. 
I'm going around from one bar to the next 
I wanted to say I'm sorry. 
Fine, alright. 
Good bye. 
I didn't get the chance this morning. 
So I came by train. 
No kidding? 
I really wanted to say I'm sorry. 
I wanted to say it to you. 
I'm sorry for what I did. 
Okay fine, I got it. So good bye. 
I thought we could go have dinner together. 
I won't eat dinner with you. 
I want you to go away. 
I feel bad... 
I don't care how you feel. 
Do you understand? I don't care. I have a date. 
What about tomorrow? 
Do you know who that was back at the hotel? We were going to get married in 3 months. 
3 months! 
He adored me. I even had an engagement ring. 
I'd be done with the bars, the mini and the smiles. 
Do you understand? 
I'd be set until the end of my life. 
I'm sorry. 
So am I. You don't know how badly. 
And now I have to start all over. 
So if you want to do me a favor, then just leave me alone. 
You don't have the time for a drink? 
Dammit. 
It's probably the second to your left. 
You go out and it's the second to your left. 
Going out, the second to your left. 
Francois? 
Yes. 
- Irene? 
- Yes. 
- How do you do? 
- How do you do? 
I love Italian food, because it's never pretentious. 
Besides, things here are exceptional, so we're never disappointed. Right? 
Indeed. 
In fact, it depends. 
But when in Italy, I don't like to eat in the local restaurants. 
It's less amusing. 
Maybe because they don't make the effort to act like Italians. 
Maybe. 
That guy next to the cars is watching us. 
And I feel funny. 
But I don't know him. 
He was with you at the bar when I arrived. 
And now he's here and I think he's waiting for us. 
And I feel uneasy. 
I'm sorry. 
This is ridiculous, Francois. 
You seem to love pasta, so you can eat mine. 
Can I leave you my number? 
Is your invitation for dinner still up for grabs? 
Yes, of course. 
I found a really nice pizza shop in the old town. No. 
I don't eat at nice pizza shops. Alright. 
As you wish. 
I'd like some caviar. 
The crayfish. 
And some champagne. 
And you? 
What will you have? 
I don't know. 
I need to think it over. 
What? 
The crayfish. 
They'll be Available at next delivery. 
The delivery has just arrived. 
Ah. I'm lucky. 
So? 
I need to leave you for a moment. 
Good evening, Mr. Molluquet. This is a message from Mr. Simon. 
Can you wire my bonus to my current account? 
My whole bonus. 
Tomorrow morning. 
I'd appreciate it. 
I'll confirm it later in writing. 
Thank you. 
Good bye, Mr. Molluquet. 
We'll order a second one. 
It's sad with just one bottle. 
It's boring. 
I didn't want to lie to you at the Biarriiz. 
I just didn't want to oppose you. 
You seemed so happy. 
And I was in heaven. 
I don't really like caviar. 
And with time I'll start to like it. 
I'm sure that when I start to like it, it will taste great. 
It's nice here, isn't it? 
I like this place a lot because it's not pretentious. 
It's calm and grand at the same time. 
We have the impression that we're unique. 
The handle is made from shark bone. 
Amazing, isn't it? 
The bones are dried for 2 years. 
It takes one shark to make one set of cutlery. 
Here you go. 
I'm bushed. 
I want to go to bed. 
At which hotel are you staying? 
I found a small, very nice hotel in the town's suburbs. 
Very good. 
So go get your stuff and we'll meet back here. 
Here? 
It's more simple that way, right? 
- Is there a problem? 
Not at all. 
See you later. 
- Mr. Simon? 
- Yes, it's me. 
Ms. Mercier is waiting for you in room 304. 
Yes, that's right. 
Thank you. 
- Did you enjoy your dinner? 
- Yes, very much. 
May I ask for your credit card? 
Excuse me? 
Your credit card. To cover the bill. 
Right. Of course. 
Thank you. 
Please take Mrs. Pontini's baggage to her room. 
- We're sorry. 
- It's alright. 
I have exactly the same. 
- They're the same color? 
. - Yes? 
Irene? 
Irene? 
Yes? 
Mr. Molluquet. 
How are you? 
Excuse me? 
No. 
No. No one stole my card. 
That much? 
Please wire the money from my PEL account to my current account. 
And my PEP account? 
And my PEA account? 
Go ahead. 
No problem. 
Please do tell me. Do I have the right to the CEL? 
Well that too then. 
How much money is in it? 
I assumed there's more. 
Well? 
Do you really want to go to town? 
- Are you sure? 
- Yes, why do you ask? - Why? 
- Doesn't ring a bell? 
What's wrong? 
- Nothing. 
- Good. 
- Jean... 
- Can we go? 
You can't continue doing this. This is my business. 
I'm paying, right? 
Indeed. 
And that's what counts, right? Indeed. 
- So where do you wanna go? 
- Nowhere. 
- So let's go for a walk. 
- I don't want to go for a walk. 
What do you want? 
I want a handbag. 
What is it? 
I feel good, because I'm not working this afternoon. 
I feel like I'm skipping class. 
Me too. 
On top of that I'm drunk. 
Better to be drunk in the afternoon than in the evening. 
It's much better this way. 
We have the impression we're keeping a secret. 
Would you like anything else? 
Maybe some ice cream? 
I want a dress. 
OPERATION CAN'T BE PERFORMED Have mercy. 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR VISIT 
This one is gorgeous. 
Castelles cake! 
Here you go. 
I got you a place in first class. 
Thank you. 
- So, good bye. 
- Good bye. 
Wait. 
Another 10 seconds. 
Fine. 10 seconds. 
Fine. 
Fine, thank you. 
Ask Jeff to come here. 
You're not looking for a barman? 
I have very good credentials. 
No, sir. 
I'm sorry sir, but I'm forced to call the police. 
Can't we work something out? 
Pool man, room service, porter, driver? 
No, sir. 
- Excuse me. - Yes? 
Can someone give me a hand with my bag? 
I'll send over Benoit. 
Don't trouble yourself. 
My friend will be delighted to give me a hand. 
You were very eager to help me last time. 
Add the bill of room 304 to the account of room 429. 
- Shall we get out? 
- Yes, of course. 
- And? 
- Will you close the door? 
- Yes, yes. 
- Which floor? 
- The third floor. 
- Good morning, sir. 
- Good morning. 
You alright? 
Impossible. You'll never go away. 
This isn't about you. 
Yesterday I had a problem with paying... 
You have to leave me alone, do you understand? 
- I have to work, Jean. 
- Calm down. 
Do you think you can go around having a crush? 
It's not about that. I met this woman and she made me an offer... 
Stop it. 
I know why you're here. 
I'm telling the truth. 
You think I don't know what's going on? 
That I don't know that look? 
Since I was 12 I've seen that look. 
- Good morning, Madeleine. 
- Did you have a nice sleep? 
Very well, thank you. 
- Have you picked something? 
- Excuse me? 
Have you been served? No, but everything is fine. 
- Won't you sit down? 
- Yes, yes. 
Excuse me. 
Shall I bring you something? Not now. 
That's nice of you, thank you. 
What's going on? 
You had a bad dream. 
But that's good because now you're awake. I know what your color is. 
You need something that's blue. 
We'll keep the indigo shirt and the lavender one, the blue one and the navy-blue one. 
But certainly not those two remaining ones. 
Can you bring me that pink dress? 
Yes. 
And this one, Jean? 
Jean! 
- Yes. 
. Yes, I'm trying it on. 
So... doing a little shopping? 
- A little. 
- And? 
It's very nice. 
She's the friend I told you about. 
She's accepted to help me for a while. 
You don't call me miss anymore? 
We have to pick something. 
We can't buy 36 shirts. And I've had enough. 
I have to go. 
My friend is in a hurry. 
Can you spare me 10 seconds? 
You look very nice in that shirt. 
Thank you. 
I'm coming. 
I took two. I didn't know which one you want. 
- Both. 
- Of course. 
Finally you're smiling. 
Got the one that please you, right? 
Yes. Come on. 
Come in, the door is open. 
4 dresses. 
What did you get? 
Shirts. 
Those 4 shirts? 
- And a pair of jeans. 
Today morning I had a wonderful breakfast... with room service. 
Jean, I can't believe it. 
- We haven't gone out much. 
- She's shafted you. 
But I didn't want it that way. 
Wait for what? That she'll marry you? 
Take. Take as much as you can. 
A new suit, glasses, shoes. Take, Jean. 
Otherwise what's it for? 
Do you have 5 minutes? 
I'm free until noon. 
No, in half an hour I'm going to a garden party. 
I love such parties. 
I'll look around and maybe pick someone up. 
The guy you're with now is no good? 
I'm with him for the time being. 
Why is that? 
He's been divorced 4 times and pays 4 ex-wives alimony. He doesn't have much left. 
Believe me, you can find someone better. 
- Is she married? 
- She's a widow. 
- You're lucky. 
- When does the party finish? 
I don't know. 
Will we see each other later? 
Of course. 
- We are neighbours, right? - Right. 
Wombats and other koala bears, who don't know what fear is, always find out too late that they can't defend themselves. 
- Are you alright? 
- I'm fine. 
How was it? 
Very good. 
I have a gift for you. 
- What is it? 
- Guess. 
- Excellent, thank you. 
- I don't know... 
A suit? 
Glasses? 
Shoes? 
A bar of gold? 
They're beautiful, aren't they? 
Yes. 
Very beautiful. 
She can't treat you like that. 
This can't go on. 
- She has the money. - So what? 
You have a soul. 
Youth. Charm. 
Make use of it. 
Do you think I have charm? 
You say that to someone you don't find attractive. 
You can resist beauty, but you can't resist charm. 
Show me how you... seduce someone. 
How...? 
You must have a trick you practiced in front of the mirror when you were 15. 
No, I don't. 
Improvise something. 
Come on, start seducing me. 
No... 
Come on, do it by staring at me. 
I can't do it just like that. 
Go ahead. 
Come on. 
I just started. 
I'm sorry. 
Show me how you do it. 
- Show me. 
- Alright. 
What's wrong Irene? 
Nothing. 
I had... 
I want to... 
I'd like to... 
What do you want? 
This is what makes the other person go crazy. 
Not finishing your sentences. 
As if the rest is too painful to say. 
Not finishing your sentences is very effective. 
That and looking ahead and afar. 
That'll get her. 
Look. 
and I'm gone. 
And you have nice arms. You should show them. 
And you have nice hands. 
What is that? 
Damn... my watch's alarm. 
She finished her meeting. 
- She set an alarm? 
- Yes, I have to go. 
I can't believe it! You aren't listening to me! 
- I am! 
- And? 
I can't change everything right away. I have to go slowly. 
Dammit... 
I know what to do. 
You have to press... 
There we go. 
- Why did you do this? 
- Because. 
That was the end of our lesson about the secret of womanhood. Go. 
Go or you'll be late. 
PLASTIC SURGEON This is ridiculous. 
You don't need this. You look very good. 
You have no business being here. 
That's nice of you. 
I have no business being here, because I come here regularly. 
Hello. 
Is everything alright since your last visit? 
Better and better. 
- Thanks. 
- Thank you. 
I'm really happy with the result. 
- Me too. 
- Good. 
So what's the matter with that ear? 
That guy is the best. 
Do you know what I had to do to set up this appointment? 
Do you know how long you have to wait sometimes for breast surgery? 
Is that the next procedure you're planning for me? 
Oh come on. 
That was nothing. A single stitch and 20 minutes. 
Do you know what you have to go through sometimes? 
I can imagine. 
Jean? 
Jean. 
Jean, stop it. 
Say something. This silence makes me anxious. 
I want to... 
I'd like to... 
What do you want? 
What would you like? 
What do you want? It's... 
It's just... 
Jean, look at your watch. 
It's broken. 
Driver take us to number 63. 
The handle is made from shark bone. 
Amazing, isn't it? 
The bones are dried for 2 years. 
It takes one shark to make one set of cutlery. 
Once I'm dead I'll donate my body to them. 
Excuse me. - Do you have a light? 
- Yes. 
Thank you. 
Do you think they sell it at the hotel's boutique? 
The watch? 
The cutlery. 
Yes. 
Of course. 
I'm sorry. 
I'll be right back. 
Oh my goodness. 
A Jaeger-LeCoultre watch. 
- Do know how much it's worth? 
- Of course. 
I can't even pronounce such an amount. 
You had a slow start, but now you're rolling. 
All this is white gold. 
With diamonds all around. 
And there's a diamond on each number. 
And inside there are rubies and other stuff. 
It's not a watch. 
What did you do to her? 
I gave her the silent treatment. 
- Great evening, huh? 
- You look nice. 
You're not rich. 
You've barely begun to be rich. 
I could never be rich. Go first. 
I'll follow you. 
- Jean? 
- Yes? 
What time is it? 
A quarter to 9. 
- It's nice here, isn't it? 
I like this place because it's not pretentious. 
It's calm and grand at the same time. 
We have the impression we're unique, don't we? Yes. 
The handle is made from shark bone. 
Amazing, isn't it? 
The bones are dried for 2 years. 
It takes one shark to make one set of cutlery. 
Good evening, sir. 
This is Francois from room service. I'm sorry to disturb you. 
We're unsure of something. 
I need to clarify something concerning your breakfast. 
The juice that you ordered. Should it be orange or grapefruit? 
Orange. 
- Orange? 
- Yes. 
Maltaise, Navelle or Sanguine? 
- A what? 
- Do you prefer a certain brand? 
- A what? 
- The brand of the juice. 
- Maltaise. 
- Excellent choice, sir. 
We also have apple juice. 
A very popular apple juice. 
It's very much in demand. 
It has a delicate flavor, but has character. 
- Thank you very much. 
- Very well. 
Yes? 
Sir, this is Francois again from room service. 
Sorry to interrupt again. 
Should they be soft-cooked, hard-cooked, fried or boiled? 
- Soft-cooked. 
- Very well. 
A very good choice. 
- No. 
Are you sure, sir? 
Starting from a certain age, a little ginseng added to your tea improves blood circulation. 
And I've also heard of spectacular erections. 
- Is this room service? - Yes.. 
I mean, no. 
Yes, this is room service. Is this a joke? 
Yes, no, this is not a joke, sir. 
Yes! 
Have you been told about the food for seniors? 
No. 
The food for seniors is specially prepared for our older clients. 
There's nothing to chew. 
The food is mechanically chewed prior to serving, so that you may enjoy every kind of food, in spite of a disability of the jaw. 
I can offer you soup, puree and yogurt. 
And stewed fruit for dessert. 
Where were you? 
I went to the bathroom. 
Two visits to the bathroom during a meal at your age? 
I'm sorry... I... 
What were you doing? 
- Were you talking to someone? - No. 
- You can tell me. 
You weren't talking to anyone or you don't want to tell me? 
I'm not jealous just curious. 
I... 
What's wrong, Jean? 
Nothing... I... 
I'd like to... 
Enough of this. 
What do you think you're doing? 
That you can play games with me like with a young virgin? 
Listen to me carefully, my boy. 
If I want to I can throw you out of here with one snap of my fingers. 
So if you want to continue to enjoy the pool and the boutiques, then you better show some more concentration. 
Do you understand? 
I'm sorry I'm late. 
We visited the boutiques. 
- She bought you a scooter? - Yes. 
It has a luggage box. 
And a full tank. 
We can go for a swim. 
I know this nice place by the sea. I've been wanting to go there since arriving here. 
We'll go there now. 
Order me a glass and I'll be right back. 
We made a good choice by picking this suit. 
- Good night. 
- Good night. 
You were right. 
It's good to go to bed early. 
It was nice of you to cancel our dinner at the restaurant. 
Really? Yes. 
It's as if you gave me a gift. 
- Don't mention it. 
You're really not hungry this evening? 
No I'm not. 
That's something rare, isn't it? 
That's true. 
Do you want some candy? 
No, thank you. 
I own some of the producer's stock. 
It makes me good money. 
- Where are you from? 
- Excuse me? 
Where are you from? 
- I'm from Saint-Brieux. 
Is it nice there? 
It rains all the time. 
Do you know that I haven't seen the rain in 4 years? 
It's always summer here. 
I miss the smell of rain. 
Do you have any siblings? 
No. 
I have 2 brothers and 3 sisters. 
I mean that... 
You haven't said anything. 
It's very nice here. I lack the words to describe it. 
Behind us is an abandoned vineyard. 
I find grapes there in September. 
And up there, to your left... There's an old sheep house. 
Do you see it? 
I can barely see my sandwich. 
Dammit. 
Impossible. 
Jean, excuse me. It would be lovely if you could bring me my book from our room. 
Irene? 
Is everything alright? 
I wanted to tell you that I spent a wonderful night. 
Me too. 
When can we do it again? 
I didn't want to fall asleep, you know. 
So that I could savor each minute. 
What's wrong? 
I'm leaving. 
I came to say good bye. 
Where to? 
I'm going to Venice. 
And then to the Maldives. 
When? 
This evening. 
When are you coming back? 
I'm not coming back. 
When I was a kid I went to Venice once with my parents. 
I remember the bread rolls they had there. I adored them. 
I don't remember their name. 
Do you know which ones? 
Yes. 
I also don't remember their name. 
And I also adore them. 
So... good bye. 
Jean? 
Jean? 
Jean? 
Jean, are you here? 
Jean? 
Jean? 
- Ah here you are. 
- Yes. 
- You OK? 
- Yeah. 
- The book was here. 
Madeleine, what's the name of those Italian bread rolls? 
Oh no, this can't be true... That bastard... 
The bread rolls are called panettones. 
- That idiot dumped me. 
- He dumped you? 
He left me here. 
And took everything. 
- But why? 
- And what do you think? 
- Do you think he saw us? 
I can't believe it. I'm so stupid. 
You have to go to the train station. 
I keep my things there in a luggage box. 
Dammit... I have nothing. 
I only have this cover and the swimming suit. 
Miss? This is for you. 
The room has been paid for the whole week. 
- Are you alright? 
- You look a little nervous. 
- What will you have? 
- I'll have a vodka. 
We'll have a scotch whisky and a vodka. 
Where's your watch? 
I sold it. 
That's not true. 
It's in our room. 
No, I sold it at the same boutique. 
- But... 
- It was mine, wasn't it? 
It was. 
I wanted to believe you're a little different. 
Not like the others. 
But you're only more clever than they are. 
I don't know what came over me. 
I wanted to buy you a gift, but I had no money. 
So... here you go. 
They're gorgeous. 
This is charming, Jean. 
That watch was the only thing you had. 
I'm sure I gave you the invitation. 
The invitation was on your nightstand. 
Most likely the cleaning lady took it. 
It doesn't matter. 
Excuse me. 
Do you have a light? 
Can I bring you some champagne? 
That would be charming. 
5 glasses, please. 
Excuse me. 
Excuse me, miss. 
Thank you. 
You're a prince. 
I will be needing your help, Jean. 
Of course. 
I saw Jacques. 
- You need to help me. 
I want you to help me... seduce him. 
Things can't go on like this, Jean. 
That situation at the pool was just too hard. I don't want to find myself without anything again. 
- I want... 
- What do you want me to do? 
Tell me. 
A glass of champagne, please. 
- One for you? 
- Yes. 
One more glass, please. Thank you. 
Getting some champagne is real madness. 
- When did you arrive? 
- About 10 minutes ago. 
- You alone? 
- Yes, for now. 
- And you? 
Here's to our health. 
- Irene. 
- Impossible... 
- What? 
This is my lucky day. 
What is it? 
- The Prince von Hoffenberg. 
The Prince von Hoffenberg. 
There, near the roses. 
Who is he? 
A mover and shaker of this world. 
He's a Dutch nobleman. 
And he's an industrial tycoon. 
He must have just arrived. 
He's very rich and very lonely. 
He lost his wife in a car accident 2 years ago. 
And since then he's in such a poor shape. 
I'll go to him and take my chances. 
Excuse me. 
Is it at her you're looking? 
Yes. 
- Is she looking at you? 
- Yes. 
She's taking shy glances at me. 
She wants to get married. 
Here you go. 
I noticed you hadn't any left. 
- Thank you. 
- Good evening. 
This is Agnes, my friend. 
- Prince Michel... 
-... von Hoffenberg. Of course. 
- Good evening. 
- Good evening. 
I'm rarely recognized. 
But you have a face that's impossible to forget. 
Have you just arrived? 
I don't intend to stay here too long. 
- I think this is a little... - Yes, that's true. 
I couldn't help myself from looking at you all evening. 
I'm sorry. 
No need to be sorry. 
You remind me of someone. 
The Princess of Edinburgh. 
- Excuse me, Ines. 
- Irene. I'm sorry. 
Don't mention it. 
Maybe we can see each other later? 
I have her portrait, painted by Rembrandt, at my country house. 
I hung it in the guest room. 
I'd like to show it to you. 
The resemblance is striking. 
She was executed during the revolution. 
Oh my God... 
I'm so sorry. 
Excuse me for a moment. 
You're behaving like a rude bastard. 
For the past hour you've been going from one woman to the next 
What are you doing? Who do you think you are? 
Do you think a little jewel is enough? 
I'm sorry, Madeleine. 
I don't give a damn that you're sorry. 
You told my friends you'll bring us some champagne, so do it. 
You have 2 minutes to bring it. 
I'd be happy to help, but I really can't. 
What do you mean you can't? 
I need to go to the hotel and spend a few hours with this girl. 
What are you talking about? 
I need to do a favor. 
Are you kidding me? 
If you leave with that girl, don't count on me, understand? 
I'll leave the scooter at the parking lot and the keys at reception. 
There's nothing I can do to stop you? 
No. 
I'm sorry. 
Stop being so nice. It's unbearable. 
It seems that a man like you can't be bought. 
I'll be fine, don't worry. 
You're not the first. 
Do I have a choice? 
You can keep the scooter. 
I'm sorry... 
That was my ex mother-in-law. The Baroness von Bosten. 
She can't stand that I talk to other women since... 
Yes. 
Don't hold it against her. She's suffering because of it. 
But I have to live on, right? 
Yes, of course. 
One must live on. 
Life goes on. 
Are you alright? 
Yes. 
No... 
I want to... 
I'd like to... 
Well well. 
- Good evening, Jacques. - Good evening, Irene. 
You see. I still remember your name. 
- Are you alone? 
What have you been doing? 
I've been signing checks. 
When did you arrive? 
I arrived this morning. I was dumped this evening. 
- Not all is lost. - You think? 
I think I've already forgotten her name. 
Excuse me. What did you say? 
That I've already forgotten her name. 
- Agnes. 
- You know her? 
Small world. 
Are you alright? 
Yes. I'm fine. 
Do you have any plans for the coming days? 
Do you have any plans? 
Excuse me? 
And I don't like it. 
Excuse me. 
It's the alcohol and the fatigue. 
I'm falling asleep. 
What were you saying? 
I asked if you had any plans. 
What are you plans for the coming days? 
Love. 
I plan to make love. 
Excuse me. 
Excuse me, Jacques. 
I'm really sorry. 
Excuse me. I'm really sorry. 
Jean... 
Prince? What's going on? 
What are you doing here? 
I'm doing you a favor. He's not a prince. 
I can't believe it. 
Excuse me. 
Well... It took you a while. 
I did what I could. 
I want to... 
I'd like to... 
Kiss you. 
Previously on Las Vegas. 
Wow. Yeah. 
I had a great time last night. 
Oh, you liked that? Mm-hmm. 
What's this? 
You dog! 
- I invited Derek Stephenson to spend a few days at the Montecito. 
- Delinda's old boyfriend from college. 
- Hey, Mr. Deline. 
- This is Dr. Derek Stephenson. 
Your boyfriend's here. 
Derek Stephenson? 
Okay. 
How much? 
A million a hand? 
All right, I'm on my way. 
And if you see anyone who resembles a casino host, call me or break their legs. 
Yeah. 
Of course you get your finder's fee. 
Excuse me. Excuse me, girls. 
Talk about running the gauntlet. 
Sorry. 
How' bout that finder's fee? 
Thank you. 
Is he okay? 
You want proof, sweetheart? There's my proof. 
Well, I'm certainly convinced. 
And this is Sam Marquez, our best casino host. 
Your casino host. 
I don't remember asking for one, but if you could help me out here - 
- Well, Mr. Stiles - 
- Dwight to you. 
Dwight to me - would like to play blackjack... for a million bucks a hand, which is great, but I told him that we need some financial information first. 
- Which I just provided. 
- Yes, you did. 
Let's get started. 
Yeah, but, Sam - Sam, as you know, stakes this high, even if he has the finances, we have to get approval from Ed. 
- He's the Montecito president. 
- Look, I know I've never played here before, but if walking in with a satchel full of cash requires management approval, then - 
I'm so sorry for the inconvenience, but I promise you, it'll just be a few minutes. 
Less than a few minutes. 
It'll be seconds. 
It'll be nanoseconds. 
Nano. 
Nano. 
Sam for Ed. 
What do you mean, he's away for the weekend? 
Well, call him. 
Yes, right now. 
You knew about this, didn't you? 
Knew about what, dear? 
The fact that there's no cellphone reception here, dear. 
It would never have occurred to me to ask. 
The whole idea of a holistic retreat is that - 
Oh, it's a retreat, all right - Right back to the Dark Ages. 
No phones - There's no television. 
There's no red meat. 
Honey, remember what Dr. Paul said? 
Wait. 
Let me think. No. 
Will you remind me? 
I know you just love to make fun of everything he says, but I think he's very insightful, and he said that you need to relax... and to appreciate the gifts of love and life. 
Which you agreed to do when we planned this. 
" We"? 
There is no we. 
You planned this. 
And I didn't know about the phones. 
What happens if somebody needs to contact me? 
Well, honey, I imagine they'll just have to carry on without you, and as a result grow as employees and human beings. 
You want that, don't you? 
Hey, let's go take a dip in the sulfur pool... before we do our first treatment. 
Hi, Dwight. 
I'm afraid that your approval is gonna take... a teensy bit longer than expected, so we're gonna put you in our presidential suite. 
And maybe we'll have Wolfgang Puck cook you a meal. 
You know what? 
I never knew playing a little blackjack was gonna be so complicated. 
Jennifer? 
Jennifer-Jennifer here will be your personal butler. 
I'm transferring you to the presidential suite. 
- Miss Connell, I have never been a personal butler. 
- Oh, yeah, you have. 
All you gotta do is look pretty and know where to find the ice machine, right, Dwight? 
- Actually, I really don't care about the ice machine. 
- I'll take you up. 
- Get Danny. He'll approve. 
- Yes. 
I'll take this for you. 
I got it. You got it. 
Danny. Hi. 
Hey. 
What are you doin'? 
Starving. 
I need something to eat. 
I'm taking Derek to the airport. 
I thought you might want to say good-bye. 
Uh - 
I thought they'd be open. 
You told me you liked him. 
Look, just so you understand guys a little better, thinking a dude is all right and wanting to say good-bye are two completely different things. 
Okay? 
Okay, but I told him you wanted to say good-bye. 
If it's that big of a deal - Okay, you know what? 
Fine. 
I'll say good-bye. 
Does Derek know about us? 
That we dated a few years ago? 
Yes, he knows. 
Does he know about what we did a couple of days ago? 
Why would I tell him that? 
I mean, do you tell every girl you meet about the last time you had sex? 
- So you like him? - Yeah. 
Yeah, I do. You asked. 
I mean, would you prefer me not to tell you the truth? 
I'm cool. 
Good. 
'Cause, you know - 
I'm glad you're okay with that'cause I consider a friend, someone I can talk to. 
Which I am. 
So, uh - 
We still gonna be able to, you know - once in a while? 
I don't know. 
There he is. 
You have a phone call. 
Something about a Mystique liquor delivery. 
Thanks, Lisa. 
Hey, hey. 
- Hey, Danny. 
- Hey, buddy. 
I have to take a call. 
I'll be right back, and then we'll go. 
And I'll be right here. 
Well, paintballing was fun, huh? - Yeah. 
- I don't think Delinda will be donning the camos again. 
Not unless there's a designer label inside. 
You guys must know each other pretty well, working together, and she said you guys were dating for a couple of years. 
Let me ask you a question. 
You think she'd be interested in a serious relationship right now, or would, uh - 
Would I just be spinning my wheels? I thought you were going to Bangladesh. 
No, I know. 
I am, but, uh - I don't know. 
I'm just curious. 
Has she ever said anything to you about wanting to settle down? 
-' Cause if you couldn't tell, I'm really into her. 
So who do you like in the play-offs? I'm going with the Pistons, myself. 
All right. 
I get it. 
I'll shut up. 
What do you think I should do? Dude, I'm not your shrink. 
You're right, you're right. 
No, no, no. 
My problem. 
Danny, there's a guy in the casino. 
He wants to play blackjack, a million dollars a hand. 
Ed's not here, so you're gonna have to okay it. He brought cash. 
- A million a hand? 
Who is he? - I don't 
- Dwight something or other. 
He's waiting. 
Let's go. 
All right, well, I gotta run. Happy trails. 
- And don't let anybody touch that sandwich. 
- What, no final advice? 
Whenever I'm struggling with something like this, I think about beer commercials... that have had an impact on me, because there's usually a message in there. 
Like, you remember" Go for the gusto"? - Well said, my friend. 
- Unbelievable. 
This Dwight guy's not on your whale radar? 
No. Did you hear me say he brought cash? 
I'm gonna have to talk to him. 
I don't think you should talk to him. 
Listen. 
It's the first time I will be approving a wager that high. 
I need to be extra careful. 
Make it fast. 
He's not gonna wait around forever. 
By the way, I don't know if you're interested or not, but there's a mentally deranged woman in Bella Petto. 
Whoa, whoa. What do you mean," mentally deranged"? 
She's been staring at the waterfall for the last three hours. 
Mike. 
Get me Bella Petto on 31, across from the waterfall. 
Excuse me, ma'am. - It's Connie. 
- Uh, I'm Mike Cannon with Montecito security. 
Oh, I'm a hotel guest. Room 5318. 
Do you mind that I don't look at you, Mike? 
Is everything okay? 
Some folks thought you weren't feeling well. 
Quite the opposite, really. 
I feel amazingly exhilarated. - Do you see him? 
- See who? 
Saint Randolph in the waterfall reflection. 
Can't say I'd recognize him. He's the only one there. 
- That's Saint Randolph, huh? 
- He's the patron saint of benevolence. 
Yesterday he told me to start gambling at 11 : 00. 
The dealers dealt me four straight blackjacks. 
So I'm waiting for him to tell me when to gamble today. 
I once got a potato chip that looked exactly like Popeye. 
Popeye's a cartoon. Yeah. 
Pool closes at 8 : 00. 
Oh, he knows. 
Probably does. 
Yeah. 
Mr. Stiles, I'm Danny Mc - Listen, Jennifer here is worried... she'll get in trouble for drinking on duty. 
I told her she wouldn't, because I insisted she join me. 
He did. 
I mean, how could I not offer a gorgeous girl like that a cocktail? 
Hmm? Don't worry. 
You're not in trouble, Jennifer. 
Thank you. 
We were having a very informative conversation. 
Did you know that bra size and cup size are not the same thing? 
Do you mind if I talk to you over here for a minute? 
Sure. 
Do a little channel surfing. See if you can find something X-rated. 
Sure. 
Think I got a shot with her? Uh, probably not. 
She's got a boyfriend. 
So can you find someone I do got a shot with? 
Like, a guaranteed shot? Young? And if I gotta pay the piper - 
Mr. Stiles - And don't give me any of this... 
" you don't do that kind of thing" crap, because I know you do. 
I was told that you wanted to play a particularly high-stakes game. That's right. 
A million a hand. 
I thought Ed Deline ran this hotel. 
He does, but he's out of town. 
In his absence, I'm in charge. 
Young, good looking and in charge. 
You got any other problems, chief? So. 
Can I play some blackjack now? I understand you brought cash. 
Mind if I take a look? 
What? 
You wanna see if it's counterfeit? 
It isn't. 
You can look at it... when I put it on the table. 
And if you lose this first hand, do you plan on continuing to use cash? 
How about this? If I lose, I'll tell you. 
If you don't like my plan for hand two, we'll part friends. 
It's not our policy - 
I'm sorry, Danny. 
About what? 
I thought when you said you were in charge, that you meant it. 
You put a million bucks on the table, we'll let you play one hand. 
Hey, Sarasvati, come on in. 
I've been meaning to talk to you. 
Yeah, me too. Yeah. 
Yeah, we haven't really had a chance... to talk about what happened out at paintball. 
You know, when everyone was sleeping. 
I enjoyed it. 
Quite a bit, actually. 
Yeah, I did too. 
But, seeing as how we work together - 
Don't worry about it. 
I'm not looking for a boyfriend. Good. 
Not that you wouldn't make a dynamite girlfriend. 
It's just that... 
I wouldn't want to jeopardize our friendship. 
Agreed. 
Agreed. 
Do you think we could still have sex once in a while? 
I don't... see why not. 
Hey. Hey, D. Hey, Danny. 
I was just asking Mike about, uh, 
Mr. Stiles. - Uh, yeah. 
I said she should talk to you. 
- Yeah. 
I heard that he's planning on playing a-million-dollar-a-hand blackjack? Yeah. 
I was just up in his suite. 
The guy's kind of a sawed-off little runt, but he's got the cash, so we're gonna let him play his hand. 
- After that we'll see. - Yeah. 
No, that's my concern. 
If he wins several hands in a row, 
I don't think our cash on hand is sufficient. 
Well, we gotta have four or five million here. 
Yes, we do, but that's to cover all current wagers. 
If he goes on any kind of a hot streak, he could severely deplete our supply. 
State gaming laws require us to have... enough cash on hand to cover every bet made. 
That's right. 
Why didn't you check that? 
- See, I-I thought you were checking it. 
- I've... been busy. 
'Cause I knew-We knew - No. 
Yeah. 
- We gotta go to the floor. 
- Oh, we goin' to the floor? Okay. 
Uh, we'll talk later-maybe more. 
Yes, we will. 
So I guess Sarasvati wasn't a one-time thing. What? 
No, that - 
Anyway, all we have to do is call the bank and have the cash transferred over. Mmm. 
We do it all the time - Holiday weekends and sports events. 
You know, a man would admit that he didn't know that. 
So you gonna man up, my brother? 
I'm gonna call the bank. 
Hey, this is Danny McCoy at the Montecito. 
We need $ 10 million in cash sent over. 
We'll send an armored truck. 
Dalton Armored Services. This is Mike. 
I'm authorizing it. 
How many people? Oh, that's right. 
I forgot. 
I'll have him call you. 
We'll send somebody to check it out. 
You first. Transfers over a million have to be authorized by Ed. 
I guess he's on some voice-recognition system. What do you got? 
Crowd-control issues with that St.-Randolph-in-the-waterfall chick at Bella Petto. 
I'll take care of that. You get a hold of Ed. 
We can't get a hold of Ed. 
They already tried him on his cell. 
Oh, that's right. 
He's at that New Age spa near Sedona. 
Probably no cell coverage. 
Want me to brush up on my smoke signals? No. 
Get a satellite phone, take the helicopter down and have Ed call in the transfer. 
Shouldn't take more than a half an hour. Got it. 
Hi. 
Danny okayed it. 
Dwight'll be down soon. 
Good. 
Listen, I meant to tell you - I enjoyed spending time with Casey. 
He's a really nice guy. 
You think my ex-husband is a nice guy? Yeah. 
Oh. 
Is that supposed to make me feel good? 
I was just making conversation, is all. 
Oh, right. 
Y-You guys-You seem like you're still pretty friendly. 
Oh, right. 
Which means," Are you still friendly, and if you are, or even if you're not, would it piss you off if I hung out with him?" 
You have quite an imagination. Oh, really? 
It's my imagination? 
Tell Dwight there's gonna be a delay. 
It's gonna be about 30 minutes. What? 
Why? 
Happens right when he leaves. 
Chaos arrives. 
Ed didn't say that. 
He's thinking it. 
Dalton Armored Services? Hey, this is Danny McCoy at the Montecito. 
I need you to send a truck to Fidelity Commerce Bank to pick up a cash transfer. 
Yes, Ed Deline will be calling in the authorization. 
Thank you. Hi. 
Hey. 
How'd it go with Derek? 
You mean my new" bestest" buddy? 
He said you gave him some good advice. 
I told him to load up on the Pistons. Hmm. 
I'm really glad you guys are getting along. Me too. 
I'm Danny McCoy with Montecito security. 
Excuse me, ma'am. 
I know that you spoke with a colleague of mine earlier today - Mike Cannon. 
Yeah. 
He said it was fine to commune with St. Randolph. 
It is, as long as it doesn't affect our other pool patrons. 
- I don't know if you invited all these other people, but - 
- I'm their spiritual guide. 
Are you... charging a fee? Of course not. 
Look, I can make sure they're more orderly if you want. 
We can't have more than two people waiting at a time. 
I'm gonna - Okay, people, if we want to receive St. Randolph's blessings, we can only have two people out here at a time, so the rest of you are gonna need to wait inside, okay? 
Thank you. 
Thank you. Hey. 
Danny, right? 
Yes, sir. 
Why don't you go get the cabana set up while we do a little man talk. 
Sam said I can cool my heels down here while you guys try to get your act together, which I'm assuming you haven't. 
Hello! 
You know what's amazing? 
Used to be, when a guy walked into a casino... willing to put down a million dollars of his money, the casino'd be thrilled to reciprocate. 
But this place - 
You know what I think you ought to do? What's that? 
Check your tea bag. 
See if you still got a pair. 
Shouldn't be more than 30 minutes. 
I'll be in my cabana. 
Oh, and spread the word - 
I'm paying 50 a headlight for" pass-bys." 
We're paying for this? Shh. 
Just let the eucalyptus oil soak into your skin. 
I could have just rolled around on the lawn. 
Mr. D! 
Mrs. D. 
Just give us a minute, will you please? 
Yeah. 
Hey. 
I hate to interrupt your getaway like this, but we need you to authorize a $ 10 million cash transfer, seeing as you're the only one who can do it. 
You know, we're trying to have a quiet, peaceful weekend here. 
I am really sorry. 
- Just make the call. 
Cash, right? 
Yeah. 
Honey, you cannot make a cash transfer on the phone. You gotta do it in person. 
But they said - No. 
Zip it. 
Uh, how'd you get here? 
Helicopter. Oh, good. 
Listen, honey, I'll be back as soon as I can. 
I promise, sweetheart. You arranged this, didn't you? 
I did not! 
I-I had 
- I had no idea. 
Mike, tell her I had no idea. 
He didn't, Mrs. D. I swear. 
Hey - Dial. 
Listen, don't get the wrong idea here either, Mike. 
If I didn't hate this place so much, I'd be kicking your ass right now. 
Understood. Here. 
It's Ed Deline. 
I'm authorizing a cash transfer. 
That's right, 10 million. 
Mind telling me what the holdup is? 
Uh, the holdup is that your boy Dwight Stiles talks the talk but apparently doesn't walk the walk. 
And I was hoping to watch the guy lose a million bucks, but apparently he changed his mind. 
I wonder why he just asked me for the third time when he'd be able to play. 
I think that he would have been here by now if he wanted to play, Sam. Oh, really? 
Sarasvati says he can't play. Do you want to know why? 
Because our supplemental cash reserve hasn't arrived. 
Well - What, you don't know what that means? Supplemental cash reserve? 
You might want to make a phone call and check that out. 
Sarasvati? I'm positive. 
The cash has not arrived. 
No. 
I've been here all day, and I'm positive. 
No one phoned in a Montecito pickup. 
Yes, Mr. Deline called in the authorization. 
The armored truck picked up $ 10 million about an hour ago. 
This is Mike. 
You're kidding. 
Mr. D. 
We got a little bit of a problem. 
The courier had all the right credentials, a-and the truck looked just like a Dalton truck. 
Can I have this tape? 
Sure. 
Looks like someone put a lot of planning into this. 
We need a list of anyone who might have had a beef with the company : 
people who were fired, quit - 
Or anyone familiar with this phone system. 
Looks like 20 minutes of incoming calls, including Danny's, were rerouted to another number. 
Oh, hi there, Danny. 
Derek. 
Yeah. I thought that you were - 
Oh, I guess I took your advice. 
" Go for the gusto." 
So what if it's based on a beer commercial? 
It resonates, man. 
Fact is, I landed in L.A., realized I had to come back - 
I got a bunch of stuff I gotta take care of. 
- Do you know where Delinda is? 
- Uh, sorry. 
Okay. 
Ed, Agent Singleton said the armored truck... was found abandoned a couple of blocks from the bank. 
That's the usual M.O. 
Perps transfer the money to a less noticeable vehicle, slap on some stolen plates. 
Might go through three or four cars before they're through. 
No hits on the prints yet. 
This is Danny McCoy. 
He's the one that called the armored truck company. 
Hey, the truck they used was painted to look exactly like a Dalton truck. 
And Las Vegas Metro tracked down the phone that ended up receiving your call. 
Prepaid cell - We found it out in the Las Vegas Wash near Desert Rose Golf Club. 
Whoever pulled this off knew when we'd be calling Dalton. 
Which means someone who knew about the cash transfer. 
- Who is that? 
How many people? 
- Well, the three of us, Sam, Mary, Sarasvati some people in Accounting and a bunch of people at the bank. 
Well, why don't you draw up a list of names, and we'll start interviewing. 
Metro will coordinate with the Bureau on a schedule. 
Sounds good. 
I'll tell you what - 
We'll get started and we'll draw up that list. 
Thanks, boys. 
What about this Stiles? 
Did he know anything about the cash transfer? 
I don't remember if I mentioned it to him, but I did run a background check, and he must be using a phony name, because nothing came back - 
No driver's license, no permanent address, no records of any kind. 
Shouldn't we tell the cops about that? 
I thought that we might want to talk to him first. 
- That's my boy. 
- Yeah. 
Excuse me. 
I'm Ed Deline, president of the Montecito. 
- Mind if I step in? 
- Mi casa es su casa. 
Thank you. 
Mr. Deline, I gotta tell you... that Jennifer girl was great, but this girl deserves a promotion. 
What's your name, honey? 
Amy. 
Amy. 
But I don't work here. 
Why don't you get lost? 
I'll catch up with you later. 
Thank you. 
So. 
You want a drink? 
Might as well. You paid for it. 
No, thanks. 
Mr. Stiles, I know Danny McCoy okayed a high-stakes game for you, but unfortunately, uh, 
I don't think we're gonna be able to make that happen. 
You afraid you're gonna get robbed again? 
- It's all over the news. 
- No, we're not afraid of that. 
It's a decision that I made. 
I apologize for the inconvenience. 
You're welcome to stay in the suite. 
Okay. 
I'm ready. 
Didn't you come here to ask me if I know anything about the robbery? 
- Do you? 
- How about this? 
You interrogate me for an hour in exchange for 20 minutes... with that black chick who works in your t-shirt store. 
Did you, uh, mention the cash transfer to anyone? 
No. 
That-That's smart. 
That's a good approach. 
Whoever pulled this off had to know the transfer was gonna happen, right? 
Wait a minute. 
I think I told the towel boy out there. 
By the way, did you get a look at the broad who was talking to the waterfall? 
Nice little body on her. 
You, uh, told a towel boy? 
Yeah. 
Mexican kid - so you know he's got 18 relatives living with him. 
What is that - Afternoon delight number three? 
Four. 
Hey. 
How'd it go with Dwight? 
I did my best not to slap him. 
He's a racist pig. Yeah. 
Anyway, he said he mentioned the money transfer to a towel kid. 
What's he been up to? 
He was inside his cabana from an hour before the robbery till 45 minutes after it went down. 
He's been keeping himself busy with a parade of women. Yeah. 
Check this out. 
Even with that nutjob who's staring at the waterfall. 
I mentioned him to the cops They got nothin to hold him on. 
In any case, he's got a pretty airtight alibi. 
I don't know. 
See, even if he didn't do it himself, he could be working with a team. 
Right? He would have had to notify the team when the transfer was gonna happen, but there were no calls made from his room, cell or land line. 
Maybe the towel boy's the messenger. 
Towel boy's nothing. 
Believe me, he's nothing. 
Listen. Here's the thing. 
If this guy knows how a casino works, he would know that we'd have to get a money transfer to cover his bets, and then he'd also know that we'd want to get this money here as soon as possible. 
So that would be easy to establish, you know, a fairly accurate time frame. Yeah. 
If the cops can't hold Stiles, neither can we. 
So we basically got nothin'. 
Have surveillance keep an eye on him. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Thanks. 
Cops just found a car in Indian Springs - key in the ignition, Dalton uniforms in the back seat, two stiffs in the trunk. 
Detective Sarnat? 
You're looking at your doers, Mr. McCoy. 
We matched their prints to the ones we lifted at the bank. 
What kind of a hit was it? 
Shots came from the street side through the open window. 
Each of the victims took two to the head. 
Small caliber. Looked like they knew the guy? 
What, like a split gone bad? 
There's no signs of a struggle. But it might also be some punk who saw the transfer from the armored truck and followed' em. 
Dude. Excuse me. 
They said you were the security department. 
Part of it, yes. Do you know that woman at the pool? 
The one who talks to that dude in the waterfall? 
Yes. I'm familiar with her. 
Well, like, all I saw was water, so... 
I asked for my donation back. 
She's asking for donations? 
Yeah. 
And when I asked for my" hundy" back, she said she was gonna put a curse on me. 
So when I got back to my room, well - 
I had my 420 in this pocket - which is now gone - so I'm pretty sure she took it. 
Well, sir, possession of marijuana is a crime in the state of Nevada, so maybe you're better off without it. 
Uh, excuse me, miss. 
Derek. Yeah. 
You're here. 
Wait. 
Why are you here? Did you miss your plane? 
No, no, no. 
No, no, no. 
Made the plane. Took the plane. 
Had to come back. 
Why? To see you. 
To be with you. 
Look, honey, I don't know what's going on, but it is very powerful and I don't seem to have any control over it. 
So I just - I had to come back to see you. 
What? 
I'm glad you came back. 
Because if you're not, tell me right now... before I make a complete idiot out of myself. 
Really. 
Really? 
How long will you be here? 
I was able to put off Bangladesh for a couple of weeks. 
Wait. 
There are cameras everywhere. 
I'll get a room. 
No cameras in the rooms. 
Okay, Connie, that's it. 
What did I do? 
Everybody's waiting. 
All right, let us know if anything comes in. 
All right, thanks. F.B.I. says no leads on any of the interviews from the bank. 
Yeah. Cops say nothing on the shootings either. 
Stiles left for an hour and a half about the time those two guys got hit. 
Then he went back to his suite. 
He left a few minutes ago. Surveillance says he's on the floor. 
Yeah, well, if anyone runs into him, I'd like to have another chat with the man. 
Mm-hmm. Oh, and I tossed out our spiritual guidance counselor. 
Good, because I think she was soliciting donations from the faithful. 
She was. She ripped off one believer's weed. 
Wait a minute. 
So I leave this joint one day, and it goes to pot? 
Double funny. 
Not bad. - Hey, Sam. 
Sam. 
- Yeah, uh, I'll call you back. 
Where's Dwight? 
Oh, he's, uh - He's playing blackjack. 
I mean, not for a million a hand, but he's definitely earning his suite. 
I don't know what you said to him. 
Thanks. I'll have to do that again. 
What do you make of that, him sticking around? 
What do I make of it? 
I think he's up to his eyeballs in this thing. 
I'll see you guys later. 
Eddie, baby. 
Come over here. 
I just split my eights, and Monroe here gave me... two sixes. 
- And an ace. 
- Can I buy you a drink, Mr. Stiles? 
Twenty-two. 
- This guy deserves a raise. 
Little elbow bending with the boss? 
- Sure. 
Why not? 
- Good. 
Color him out. 
Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
You know, there ought to be a law against having an ass that good. 
What you been up to today, Dwight? 
Enjoying this unbelievable Montecito hospitality. 
Where were you, if you don't mind me asking, between 2 : 00 and 4 : 00? 
When those two guys got whacked? 
Yeah. That was on TV too. 
You weren't here. 
We have you on surveillance, leaving. 
I'm getting the impression you somehow think I'm involved in this whole thing. 
You're a very perceptive man. 
As far as where I was, none of your friggin' business. 
Ed, relax. 
The money's insured, and I'm still here gambling. 
You think about that? 
If I robbed your casino, why would I hang around? 
Talk to the cops, talk to you? 
Maybe it's part of the plan - hide in plain sight. 
Well, if I ever rob a casino, I'll remember that. 
What's your real name there, Dwight? 
I'm trying to be a sport here, Ed, but I gotta tell ya, you're making it a little unpleasant. 
I'm sorry. 
You tell me about shooting your two cronies, we'll forget the whole thing. 
This is on you, right? 
Ed. 
You got nothin'. 
Would you like to bet your million on that? 
Dwight split. 
He got on a flight to Los Angeles. 
The F.B.I. said they'll notify the L.A. office, but unless he does something stupid they're only gonna watch him for a couple of days. 
Hold that thought. 
There's a long shot I want to play. 
- Connie. 
- Look, I'm leaving. 
You have any controlled substances in this suitcase? 
Give me that. 
Maybe I'll run it by the drug-sniffing dogs the D.E.A.' s training in here. 
- Give that to me. 
- I will, soon as the dogs get over here. 
What do you want? 
We want information about Dwight Stiles, and we know that you were in his cabana. 
Yeah? So? 
We're trying to find him, and if you help us out... maybe we'll let you go through that suitcase and flush anything you don't need down the toilet. 
We just met out by the pool and we hooked up 
I don't know where he is. 
I barely even know him. 
Call the D.E.A. Yeah. 
I'll get those dogs out here. 
Okay, wait. 
I think this belongs to him. 
He must have accidentally dropped it in my purse. 
Just dropped it in there, huh? 
Mm-hmm. - Maybe there's an address. 
- Maybe. 
D.E.A. dog-training exercise? 
It worked, didn't it? 
I expected better. Mm-hmm. 
- So we got an address? 
- No. Maybe something more interesting. 
I check the trash section and was able to retrieve... some recently entered map coordinates. 
Don't ask. 
It's complicated. 
I could have figured this out. 
It's a location just outside of town, in the desert. 
Should be right here. 
Hold on, Danny. 
Give it to Mike. 
Hey. 
- Eight more bundles like these in the hole. 
Mike, uh, you think you can set up some kind of alarm system out here? 
Piece of cake. 
All right, look. 
I'm gonna call the F.B.I., tell' em not to let anybody know we found this stuff. 
That's a good one, Delinda. 
Hey, Mom. 
Hi, sweetheart. 
How was the spa? 
Well, it was lonely. 
Your father left right in the middle of it. 
I'm so upset with him. 
I thought Dr. Paul straightened everything out between you two. 
Yeah, right. 
Hey, guess what. 
Derek came back. 
Said he missed me so much he postponed his trip to Bangladesh. 
I like that man. 
I think I like him too. 
I'm going up to see him. 
Yes! 
Honey. 
Hey, you're back early. 
Yes, because I didn't realize I was gonna be sitting around all by myself. 
I should have taken some reading material. 
Uh - I'm - I'm sorry. 
Hey, come on. 
Sit down. 
You will not believe what happened. 
I mean, you will not believe this. 
Listen to this. You remember the money transfer Mike asked me to make? 
Mm-hmm. The money gets stolen, and the two guys that did it get shot. 
Now I started to call you, but then I remembered - 
Of course, you know this. 
I couldn't make a call. 
Robbery and a shooting - That's terrible. 
Yeah. 10 million bucks. 
But that doesn't matter. 
What does matter is that I wanna make up for this interrupted weekend, and we'll go back as soon as everything quiets down a little. 
Really? 
Yeah. 
And you'll relax? 
If I have a satellite phone. 
I'll be the most relaxed, the most" Zenned-out" guy you ever saw. 
Hi. 
Hi. 
How's the suite? 
Excellent. 
Yes. 
A little upgrade from a hut and a dirt floor, but, you know, it'll have to do. 
Do you remember the first time... that we kissed? 
Class trip to Williamsburg? 
Do you remember where in Williamsburg? 
A hallway in some auditorium, while we were supposed to be inside at some concert. 
Wow, very good. 
You know, for 10 years, every time I hear harpsichord music, I think of that very kiss. 
I do. 
No. 
Ah, ah. No peeking. 
What - No. 
No peeking. 
Just follow me. 
Huh? The wig and everything. 
Yeah, I go all out. 
Delinda? 
Will you marry me? 
Now, before you answer, 
I know this is sudden - really sudden - but I know I love you. 
And I know we're right for each other. 
Derek. 
I think I need to sit down. 
Okay. 
Yeah, yeah. 
- Derek, the music is sweet, but - 
- No. 
I'll, uh - 
It's okay. 
Could you, uh - 
Thank you. 
Thanks. 
I want to spend the rest of my life with you. 
Derek, part of me wants to say yes - Then say it. 
It's just so unexpected. 
And you'll probably hate me for saying this, but I just - 
I need some time to think, when my head isn't spinning. 
I'm really excited. 
I am. 
I - I just need to think about it. 
I understand. 
Okay. 
You - No, it's okay. 
Is the offer still good for a couple of days? 
For you, yeah. 
You're crazy. 
Do you see his image? 
It's St. Randolph. 
He gives me advice on when to gamble. 
You know, Connie, 
I just saw St. Randolph's image in the back of a cab out front. 
Let me show you. 
... out of his pocket, turns it on and sees another dude inside there and says," What are you doing here?" 
And the other guy says," I don't know. 
How do we get out?" 
He goes," Help me find my keys, and we'll drive out." 
Yeah. 
That isn't funny. 
" Drive out"? 
That is - It's not that funny. 
I get it. 
Well - 
It's just not a great one. 
I-Is that - Yeah. 
I'd almost forgotten. 
Dwight. 
Danny McCoy, Mike Cannon. 
From the Montecito, remember? 
God, I hate when they do this. 
Glad you could make it back to Vegas. 
Previously on" Lost"... 
Each one of us was brought here for a reason. 
- And who brought us here, John? 
- The island. 
It's destiny. 
You and your partner will observe a psychological experiment in progress. 
Your duty is to observe team members in another station on the island. 
These team members are not aware that they are under surveillance or that they are the subjects of an experiment. 
Every single second of my pathetic little life is as useless as that button! 
As long as you push it, we'll never be free. 
If you're so sure it's not real, then just stop pushing the button. 
Well, I have, except, unfortunately, someone else decided to start. 
Tomorrow we're gonna find out what happens if that button doesn't get pushed. 
John! 
Who is he, box man- - the man out there pounding on the door? 
His name is Mr. Eko. 
Why does Mr. Eko carry around a stick covered in scripture? 
Because he's a priest. 
- We need to push the button. 
- No, we don't! 
It's all bloody real! 
Now push the damn button! 
- You've killed us all. 
- No, I just saved us all. 
System failure. 
I was wrong. 
When did John get back? 
What's he doing? 
Well, where's he been? 
Where's everyone else? 
Don't you think you should go find out? 
So you're gone for a whole day after a massive hatch detonation. 
You don't call, you don't write. 
Sorry. 
Am I interrupting something? 
What, you... you can't speak, John? 
I am sorry about that. 
So where are Eko and Desmond? 
Are they off being mute and building structures as well? 
I know. 
You can't speak. 
You need to speak. 
To me? 
What do you want to... 
The sand. 
You need to speak to the sand. 
Trees. 
Yeah, I've heard they're wonderful conversationalists. 
Hey. 
I don't understand. 
Who do you need to speak to? 
The... church. 
Sky. Ground. 
Island. 
Island. 
You need to speak... to the island. 
" I need your help." 
Since when do you need my help? 
" I need u 2 stand guard." 
Oh, yeah, so you can talk to the island. 
Yeah. 
Sounds dangerous. 
Well, amusing as the mute game invariably is, you are aware, John, that I detest you, aren't you? 
You do remember repeatedly punching me in the face and accusing me of using heroin when I was not? 
What the sodding hell is a" sweat lodge"? 
- Where you headed? 
- Eureka. 
Well, I can get you as far as Bridgeville. 
Come on, hop in. Come on. 
All I, I had was gone my name's John. 
- Eddie. 
- Hi, Eddie. 
- Nasty day to be hitching. 
- Yeah, that's for sure. 
If you don't mind my asking, what's in Eureka? 
I heard there was some work there, cutting timber. 
Oh, is that what you do? 
That might be what I do. 
I don't know. 
All I know is that I had to get out of where I came from. 
Mom's dead, dad's a drunk. 
Hey, look at that. 
The rain is passing. 
What, did you rob a bank? 
'Fraid so. 
Can I see your license and registration, please? 
- Was I speeding, officer? 
- Taillight's out. 
Could you both please step out of the vehicle? 
What do you got back here? 
Guns and groceries. 
Now the- - the transaction logs and the paperwork for all of' em's in the red notebook right there in that duffel. 
So are we free to go? 
I could still take you in for picking up a hitchhiker. 
Oh, that's my uncle. 
I called him, and he picked me up. 
Get outta here. 
So what is with all the guns... uncle? 
Oh, I like the indoor fireplace. 
It's very snazzy. 
What's that? 
You're not... 
taking drugs, are you, John? 
I only ask because of the strict zero-tolerance policy you've enacted. 
I wouldn't want you to have to start punching yourself in the face. 
Yeah, I know. 
I get it. 
You're gonna go in your little magic hut, and I'm gonna stand out here in case you devolve into a monkey. 
" Don't come in." Okay. 
Okay. 
I get it. 
Hi, John. 
It's good to see you again. 
What's that, John? 
Oh. You're sorry. 
That's okay. 
I was the sacrifice the island demanded. 
Don't worry. 
You'll speak when you have something worth saying. 
I'm here to help you find your way again, so you can bring the family back together. 
Come on. 
I want to show you something. 
John... you're gonna need that. 
John, someone in this airport's in serious danger. 
You are the only one who can save them. 
Not them. 
They'll be fine... for a while. 
I think Sayid's got it. 
Next, please. 
Not Hurley. 
Forget it. 
He's helping himself. 
There's nothing you can do for them, not yet. 
First you have to clean up your own mess. 
Clean up your own mess... first you have to clean up your own mess. 
Clean up your own mess. 
Come up here, John. 
Clean it up, John. 
They've got him. 
You don't have much time. 
John. 
What happened? 
Are you all right? 
What are you doing? 
I'm going to save Mr. Eko's life. 
- Eko's cross. 
- He was dragged this way. 
- Dragged? By what? 
- By the polar bear. 
Sawyer killed the polar bear. 
He killed a polar bear. 
What's that, John, blood? 
I'm gonna go on alone, Charlie. 
You go back to Claire. 
Well, I'll take my chances. 
You don't want to go with me, Charlie. 
Bad things happen to people who hang around with me. 
Hey, Bobby. 
What's that? 
That, Eddie, is our sweat lodge. 
A what? 
Anybody who wants can go in there and light a fire and get it nice and hot and meditate. 
Then what? 
And then you're supposed to figure out what to do with your life, you know, what direction to take. 
Go on in there and figure out if you're a farmer or a hunter. 
So which are you, John? 
- Hey, John. 
- Hey, Mike, Jan, this is Eddie. 
He's looking for some logging work, but I convinced him to come home and have supper with us first. 
- Nice to meet you, Eddie. 
- Nice to meet you. 
Any friend of john's is a friend of ours. 
John's a very special guy. 
Grab a spot. 
So you like Geronimo Jackson, huh? 
Uh, yeah, yeah. 
They're all right. 
It's one of my dad's old shirts. 
Your dad has excellent taste. 
Listen up, people. 
John brought a guest to supper. 
So, everyone, this is Eddie. 
Hi, Eddie. 
Eddie, this is everyone. 
Nice to meet you. 
John, you want to say some grace? 
Yeah. 
Thank you, Lord. 
Thank you for the food and the friends, and thanks for the rain today, so that Adam will stop grumbling about the droughts. 
And for me, thank you for helping me stop being so angry, and... and for... 
helping me find a real family. 
Well, because they're a hell of a lot better than the one I used to have, so let's eat. 
Amen. 
- Amen. 
Let's dig in. 
- Ah, potatoes? 
- Thank you. 
Thank you. 
- Is that the hatch? 
- What's left of it. 
What happened? 
Hmm. Looks like it... imploded. 
What is that? 
It's an active kill, meaning that whatever was eating this is coming back for more. 
If you want to say polar bear, you can just say it. 
All right. 
Polar bear. 
Run! 
Dude. 
They kept Jack, Kate and Sawyer, and they sent me back to tell everyone else that we can't ever go over there. 
Oh, and that dude we had in the hatch- - Henry? 
He was there. 
He's, like, their leader. 
So... what do we do? 
Do what they told you. 
Go back to the camp and tell the others. 
You're not gonna do anything? 
I am doing something. 
Go back to the beach, Hugo. 
Wait. 
Where are you guys going? 
The island told locke he has to save Eko. 
Save him from what? 
Well, apparently a bear's got him. 
It's just made an active kill. 
You may want to hustle. 
Bear? 
What bear? 
What's that, more fur? 
This way. 
When I used to get high, 
I'd watch nature programs on the" beeb." 
Polar bears are meant to be quite clever. Very clever. 
They're like the Einsteins of the bear community. 
- She likes you, man. - Shush. 
- Oh, yeah, she does. 
- She does not. 
Yeah, she does. 
She's like half my age, man. 
You'd be better off with her. 
Unh-unh, no. 
Lizzie's too granola for me. 
What she really wants is a daddy, like everyone else here. 
You should take advantage of that. 
That's not real funny, Eddie. 
It was a joke. It was a joke! 
I'm sorry. 
How come you never talk about your dad, John? 
Nothing worth talking about. 
What's going on in that greenhouse over there? 
Maybe they need a hand with that fertilizer. 
No, no, no, they're okay. 
They're okay. 
Come on. 
We got orchard duty. 
What's the big secret, John? 
Sorry? 
The greenhouse. 
What do you guys got in there? 
What are you hiding? 
'Cause every time I go near it, you and everyone else acts all weird. 
Look, you're a guest here. 
These things take time. 
I've been here for six weeks. 
- Eddie, nothing's- - 
- I'm not blind, man. 
Did you forget that you had a duffel bag full of guns when you brought me here? 
Mike and Jan welcomed you here with open arms. 
They feed you. 
They give you a place to stay- - 
And Mike and Jan fold their hands every night before chow and talk about how we're family, but your family's got too many secrets. 
Now I see the fertilizer going into that greenhouse. 
I know what's going on... and I want in. 
In on what? 
Whatever you guys are trying to blow up. 
What's so funny? 
Nothing. 
I'll talk to Mike and Jan. 
You really think Eko's in there? 
Let's hurry up and do this. 
Maybe the bear's out finishing his lunch. 
You're not going in there, Charlie. 
- What? 
- I'm gonna do this alone. 
You don't get to tell me what I can't do. 
If I want to go in there, I'll go in there. 
- Why? 
- What? 
Why do you want to go in there? 
- I don't need a reason. 
- Then go back. 
Go back? 
You don't have a good reason to go in there, either. 
I'm going in there because I'm supposed to go in there. 
If it all goes to plan, we probably won't even see the bear, will we? 
Hopefully he won't smell us. 
Hair spray? 
Now I hate to be the one to point this out to you- - 
It's not for me. 
Bear? 
Is that you? 
Who's there? 
Are you alone, brother? 
Uh... yeah. 
Whoa, dude. I'm not alone. 
The beach camp's right over there. 
Can you get me some clothes? 
What happened to yours? 
I woke up in the jungle like this. 
So... 
like, the hatch... blew off your underwear? 
Fine. 
You wanna discuss this in great detail right now, let's do it. 
No, no, that's okay. 
I think I got something in here. 
How do you feel about tie-dye? 
Hey, Kim. 
Hey, Mike and Jan in? 
Yeah. 
They were looking for you. 
Good, good. 
Good timing, then, huh? 
Go on in. 
You got all the cash? 
- In the bag. 
- Which bag? 
The one with the mey in it! 
- What about the bank records? 
- Leave' em. 
Shouldn't we sort out what they can trace? 
There is no time, Mike. 
- What's going on? 
- What does it look like? 
I don't... 
Yyou screwed up, John. 
You blew it big time. 
What are you- - what... what... 
Wh-what are you doing? 
Are you leaving? 
Why? - That is why, you idiot! 
- John, your friend's a cop. 
You know how much jail time we'd get for this much weed? 
Nice picture, huh? 
Got him fresh out of the academy. 
No, he was- - he was hitchhiking. 
He told me he was going to Eureka. 
He was waiting for you, John. 
He has been here for six weeks gathering evidence because you brought him here. 
No, Mike, that's impossible. 
He played you for a sucker. 
Now it's over. 
No. 
Wait. Wait. 
No, wait, wait. 
Stop! 
We don't know what he's told' em. 
He hasn't even been in here yet. 
If he's still gathering evidence and trying to make a case, 
- then it's not too late. 
- Not too late for what? 
To protect us. 
To protect all of us. 
It's not too late to fix this. 
I can fix this. 
How are you gonna do that, John? Huh? 
Eko? 
John... 
Is he okay? 
He alive? 
Is he all right? 
He's alive. 
Turn him over, turn him over. 
Charlie, we gotta get outta here. 
Okay. 
Let's get him up. 
When you say" turned a key," you mean, like, a key key? 
- It was a failsafe key. 
- That seems kinda convenient. 
I'm sorry? 
I'm just saying, if you had this magic key the whole time, why didn't you, like, use it? 
I didn't know what would happen. 
So what did happen? 
Well, the failsafe key must have detonated the electromagnetic anomaly, made the hatch implode. 
But you didn't implode. 
No. 
You're not gonna, like, turn into the Hulk or something? 
so is that what made the blender noise and the sky turn purple? 
Afraid I missed that, brother. 
Right. 
You were failsafing. 
Well, F.Y.I., the whole island vibrated, and Kate and Jack and Sawyer saw it, too, right before they had bags pulled over their heads- - 
Don't worry. 
Locke's gonna go after them. 
He said so in his speech. 
What? 
What speech? 
All he said was he was gonna save eko and kill bears. 
Right. 
Right, of course. 
I'm sorry. I... 
I'm just, uh, a bit shook up. 
I burned that bear pretty good. 
I don't think he's gonna be coming after us. 
Now that we've survived this suicide mission, do you wanna tell me what you saw? 
- What I saw? 
- In your spirit tent. 
- I saw Boone. 
- Boone? 
What did he have to say for himself? 
He told me I had to clean up my own mess. 
Well, dead as he may be, I agree with Boone. 
After all, if you kept pressing that button like Eko told you to- - 
We wouldn't have had to save him in the first place. 
Yeah, Charlie, that's what cleaning up your own mess means. 
Spoken like someone who's had a few too many messes to clean. 
- No deer, huh? 
- Nope. 
- You talk to Mike and Jan yet? 
- Yeah, sure did. 
Yeah? 
What'd they say? 
They said that I should bring you by the greenhouse tonight after supper and that they would explain everything. 
Cool. That's great. 
What, did you see something? 
John. 
What are you doing? 
Did you know it would be me? 
- What? 
- In the truck. 
Did you know it would be me driving? 
Did- - did they choose me? 
They? 
John, I have no idea what you're talking about- - 
I didn't load that one. 
So how about you just answer the question, Eddie? 
Yeah. 
They chose you, John. 
Why? 
Because you hadn't been here long, didn't have a criminal record, and the psych profile said you would be amenable for coercion. 
A-amenable for coercion- - 
Hey. Lower the gun, John. 
Okay? 
This isn't personal. 
Oh, it's not personal? 
Stop, stop. 
I'm sorry, John, but you're not gonna shoot me. 
You're not a murderer. 
You're a good man. 
You're a farmer. 
Nope. 
I'm not a farmer. 
I was a hunter. 
I'm a hunter. 
I'm gonna walk away now, John. 
Hey, John. You hear something? 
- It sounds like a stream. 
- Yeah. 
Let's put him down. 
Maybe if we getsome water in him... 
I'll go. 
You stay here. 
I'm sorry. 
Sorry I ever doubted you. 
Sorry I gave up on my faith in the island. 
I messed up. 
Now our people are captured and... if I'd just listened to you, you know, if I'd just let you... keep pushing the button... 
I could've gone with them, protected them. 
I could've saved' em. 
You can still protect them... 
You can still save them. 
I don't even know where they are. 
You will find them. 
After all... you are a hunter, John. 
You say something? 
He's awake. 
Eko? 
Eko. 
Maybe we should just... get him back, John. 
Yeah. 
- You all right? 
- Yeah. Just keep walking. 
- Hey! 
- John? 
Charlie? 
- What happened? 
- We got him. 
- Is he alive? 
- We need Jack. 
- Take him in. 
- Jack's not coming back. 
They've got him. 
What? 
What are you talking about? 
Jack's gone? 
I don't understand. 
Okay, when were you planning on telling us, Hurley? 
What do you mean," they"? Who's" they"? 
" They" are the others, and yes, they've taken Jack... and Kate and Sawyer. 
How? 
What happened? 
Well, what about sun and Jin and Sayid? 
Are they okay? 
I don't know. 
I'm gonna find our friends. 
I don't know how yet, but I will. 
We're gonna find them- - all of them. 
And then we're gonna bring them home. 
But first things first. 
We've gotta look after Mr. Eko, so, 
Paulo, Nikki, bring towels and water. 
Claire, we gotta clean him up, so bring all the first aid supplies you can find. 
Okay. 
Not a bad speech. 
" Whoa," what? 
Just got hit with, you know... déjà vu. 
Okay. 
Well, when that wears off, can you get... bandages? 
From the kitchen? 
Previously, on Prison Break... 
I need the number from sundown hotel, please? 
Got one in gila, new mexico. 
6-3, Tomorrow. 
Who is this? 
I think you already know. 
But if I buried someone in my own backyard, I'd think about it all the time. 
Let me and my family disappear and in return, I'll keep your little secret. 
I know it's not how you wanted this to play out. 
Sometimes things happen that are just... out of your control. 
I'll see you soon, michael. 
It just may be sooner than you think. 
You can't be here! 
Where's your sister? 
I need to see maricruz. 
The wedding's at 2 : 30.

I've arranged for us to get to panama. 
We're meeting up with my brother tomorrow. 
Wait.That's your plan? 
To run away to panama with the two most wanted men in america? 
Michael, I came here because I thought you were going to have real answers for me. 
This is an answer. 
And, right now, it's the only one we've got. 
Running away into the sunset with the man who lied to me? 
Really? 
I mean, did you know about the other guys? 
Did you know that I would be putting t-bag back out on to the street? 
I never meant for that to happen. 
I was doing what I needed to do. 
My brother was going to die. 
Well, my father's dead. 
I am sorry about your father. 
I'm sorry for a lot of things. 
For what I did to you. 
I have many, many regrets, but that's the biggest. 
it does not help me right now 
I'm sorry for that, too. 
I didn't expect you to, uh... 
I didn't expect you forgive me. 
But I don't want you, to, uh...

Give me my credit card. 
What did you get me? 
What did you get? 
Prune juice, smokes, a little dip, and a bag of sliders. 
What do you want first? 
Looks like a chew guy to me. 
No spitting. 
He's had worse things in his mouth. 
what do you want, fernando, from the future? 
Would you run if I said you? 
Would you chase me if I did? 
we got to get back to my car. 
It's too far. 
If we go now, before he gets more people... he's not gonna call for backup. 
he wants his privacy. 
Why? 
He's not trying to catch me. 
He's trying to kill me. 
Your grandfather. 
He was the reason I was set up in the first place. 
He used to work for the people who wanted me dead. 
This is all just to get to him. 
Your father should be arriving any minute. 
Jane, right? 
Sorry. 
Don't worry about it. 
You know my dad? 
Well? 
Well enough. 
We used to work together. 
Ah, the company. 
Yeah. 
But that was a long time ago. 
And now I work against them, just like he does. 
So I guess you walked out on your family, too. 
No explanations, no good-byes. 
I don't have a family. 
Lincoln, he really wants to see you and your brother. 
He hasn't seen michael since he was ten years old. 
They're here. 
Wait here. 
let's go 
Where are we going? 
Michael never met your grandfather. 
Dad. 
I don't want to get trapped in here. 
There's got to be an exit on the other side. 
You go on. 
Michael. 
i'll be right behind u.Go. 
the news is not good. 
Burrows was intercepted before I got here. 
It is a setback, but we're not that far behind. 
Paul, paul, calm down. 
It'll be all right. 
Someone will take care of it. 
Someone... who? 
Bill, tell me you're not bringing someone else in on this. 
You didn't think you were alone on this, did you? 
You're a soldier. 
There's an army. 
Tell me, what do you have on sara tancredi? 
What does that have to do with this? 
Go back to your original assignment. 
Bill, I'm here now. 
I can do this, and then... the girl. 
We need to know what her father told her. 
When you find out, give me a call. 
This is agent kellerman. I need that rental car information on sara tancredi. 
Yeah, this is it right here. 
75-foot twin diesel azimut, flybridge, panoramics, you pull up in a boat like that, you're somebody. 
- Let me see. 
- Get off. 
how ya doin', bagwell? 
Get the stool. 
- What stool? 
- The stool. 
It's from one of them lockers in a bus station. 
I'll try not to think about where it's been. 
911 Calling... no, no, no, no- - don't do that, now. Come on. 
Hey, there. 
Send the police. Some scumbag broke into my house. 
Yeah, 1505 marberry hill. 
- Is he still there? 
- Yeah, you better come quick. 
let's hit it, roy. 
Come on, now, please don't do this. 
Don't- - just don't leave me like this, okay? 
I can take you right to the money, I know right where it is. 
So do I. Adios. 
I'm begging you, don't do this. 
Please! 
Geary, come on, we can make a deal, man. 
Come on, come on. 
No deals. 
You just crapped out your last bargaining chip, pal. 
Please! 
I wouldn't do that if I were you, alex. 
You smell that? 
It's propane. 
It's filling the room. 
And if you pull that trigger, we both die. 
I'll do it. 
I'll do it! 
Maybe. 
But before you do, let me ask you a question, alex. 
Do you think you're still one of the good guys fighting the good fight? 
Because I think we both know you've crossed over. 
You're on the wrong, side chasing the wrong guys. 
My brother is innocent. 
He never killed anyone. 
Oh, thanks for opening my eyes. 
Okay, alex, shoot. 
We both know what will happen. 
The propane will kill me anyway, what difference does it make? Might as well do it right now. 
That's a good point. 
there. There! 
That'll give you some time to think about what you're doing. 
But first, a word of advice : 
Stop. Because when you get close, I will win every time. 
You think? 
- I'm not the one in the cage. 
- No, you're not. 
There's one big difference between you and I, michael. 
And you just proved it. 
You can't kill. 
And that's what it's gonna take to stop me. 
'Cause I don't have the same reservations. 
I can'T. 
So whether it's today in gila or tomorrow in albuquerque or two months from now... in panama. 
I will get you. 
I don't have a choice. 
I bought us some time. 
You okay? 
You're bleeding. 
Yeah, let's go. 
Your seatbelt. 
TRIBURE.KANSAS 
Here. 804. 
Move. 
Ain't that the most beautiful thing you ever seen? 
All that green. 
It's prettier than the grand canyon. 
You know, roy, this is a monumental moment for both of us. 
Hand over the bag, bellick. 
Put down the pounder, grandma. 
Hey, hey. I am not kidding around. 
Well, you think your pansy ass... 
Next time, you pick through the crap. 
Okay, first-aid kit, disposable phones, couple of toothbrushes. 
What about the motel? 
They charge by the hour, so they didn't ask for id. 
- Do you have the keys? 
- Yeah. 
Sorry, we're not home. Leave a message at the beep and we'll get back to you. 
Listen. Is message is for maricruz. 
I was right there waiting for your call, but the cops showed up and i couldn't pick up the phone. 
I know probably that's the exact reason why you may not want to be with me. 
Listen to me. 
My aunt idalyz, she lives outside mexico city, in the mountains, on a farm, with... 
with a llama for the baby to ride. So, next week, when you fly back home, when you go to the airport, I'll be there. 
In the airport. In ixtapa I'll wait for you. 
I promise you, marita. 
I love you, mari.I love you more than anything and I can't live without you. 
I just know I can make it work, baby. 
This is, uh, in case you run into trouble down the road. 
I have a way. 
- Where is she? 
- Who? 
Maricruz. She wasn't home and she's not at work. 
Well, she's not here. I don't know where she is. 
You want problems, kalinda? 
Don't lie to me. 
She went to mexico, didn't she? 
And on our honeymoon. 
Paid for with my money. 
This isn't gonna feel good. 
I have a high tolerance for pain. You know that. 
You do. 
And you're not a diabetic, are you? 
All right. 
Michael, tell me something. 
You think there's a part of you that enjoys this? 
Peroxide in an open wound? 
I mean escaping from prison and being on the run and the danger and the fear and the rush, all that. 
It, uh... it feels to me like... chasing a high. 
And... and I know what that's like and... 
I should know better by now. 
I never thought about it like that. 
I know you've heard this before, but it won't always be like this. 
From everything you've told me, it's just getting worse. 
They can't chase us forever. 
The guy who caught up with us today, he stops at the border, and that's why we have to get across. 
And I have the people in place to help us do that. 
We're meeting them tomorrow. 
One more day, sara. 
One more day. 
That's all I'm asking. 
You can go get cleaned up. 
Keep this dry. 
Sara. 
I'm glad you came. 
- this is him. 
- Lincoln, jr. 
- You named him after yourself. 
- I wasn't gonna name him aldo. 
Lj, this is your grandfather, aldo burrows. 
Waited for this for a long time. 
I've arranged a safe place for both of you to go to. 
Well, thanks for bailing us out, but, uh, we got to meet michael. 
Where is he? 
Down by the border, a place called bolshoi booze. 
- I can go alone and get him. 
Things are different. 
There's some evidence. 
We just need a little more time, and we can blow this whole thing wide open... but there is no time. 
I trust michael he has a plan to get us to panama. 
You don't understand. 
You don't need to go to panama. 
You don't need to run anymore. 
Tell me good news. 
I got burrows- - the trifecta. 
- Take care of them. 
- What about scofield? 
They're gonna meet him. 
It doesn't matter. 
Do it now. 
sara? 
hi, sara.

Don't worry, New York! 
We will save you! 
Come on, boys. 
Honey, we're home. 
How's my girl? 
Daddy! 
Hey, boys, come here. 
Anything interesting happened while we were gone? 
Nope, everything was... unbelievably ordinary. 
Wait'll you see what I got you guys. 
What do you think it is? 
Paris is cold this time of year, so here's a nice warm coat. 
Brown Wool, 
It's not flashy, but it's fashionable. 
Now let's talk about gloves. 
I'll let you two say good-bye. 
You can't leave. 
I have to. 
At least until the election's over. 
I found you in Odessa. 
We save each other, you end up being my niece. 
This isn't just random, okay, this is destiny. 
My father sacrificed himself so that I could have a life, not a destiny. 
You can't save me, Peter... not this time. 
And Nathan can? 
Nathan can keep me safe. 
Safe? ! 
You can't get hurt! 
You're here to save the world. 
How? 
! 
I'm sorry, I can't go around chasing some fantasy. 
It's not some fantasy, okay? 
I explode. 
I see it. 
I wipe out this whole city. 
You, Nathan, everyone. 
You explode? 
Yeah. 
Like a nuclear bomb. 
Nuclear? 
Like Ted. 
Ted? 
Who the hell is Ted? 
- I told you no phone calls. - It's my wife. 
If we're going on a suicide mission, 
I'd like to call her and tell her I love her, say good-bye. 
You think I don't want to talk to my wife? 
That I don't miss my son and my daughter? 
We're doing this to protect the people we love. 
The company has a new tracking system. 
Now, this Walker System doesn't rely on Isotopes and Satellites. 
It just finds you wherever you are. 
So we've gotta play this smart. 
Switch cars, stay to the back roads. 
Fine, we go to New York, we wipe out the Walker System. 
Exactly. 
Ted. 
Yeah, almost done. 
Let's go.. 
That man. the glowing hands. 
He's the exploding man. 
I'm going to take his power. 
I'm going to explode? 
Is this my future? 
Is that what you saw, Isaac? 
Hello? 
Mohinder, I need your help. 
Sylar? I think I'm gonna do something bad. 
You're a murderer. 
You don't get the luxury of regret. 
You don't understand. 
I think I'm gonna kill a lot more people. 
A lot more... 
I understood it before... the killing. 
I had a reason. 
To take what others didn't deserve. 
It was natural selection. 
What are you talking about? 
An Apocalypse. 
A Massacre. 
Half the city gone in an instant. 
They mean nothing. 
They're innocent. 
There's no gain, so why would I do it? 
What possible reason could I have for killing so many? 
Wait, listen. 
You don't have to. 
If you're truly repentant about what you've done,... turn yourself in. 
I can hear you dialing 911. 
It was a mistake to call. 
No, wait, Sylar... 
Sylar! 
Where's Micah? 
A car from the Corinthian Casino picked him up. 
That's Linderman's casino. 
What aren't you telling me? 
Linderman said that, he needed Micah for a job. 
A job? ! He's ten years old, and you let him go? 
! 
Of course not. 
I told him no. 
- What have you done? 
- Me? It was Linderman. 
No, this is your fault! 
Your responsibility. 
I'm done with you. 
I'll get Micah my damn self. 
Don't let him go. 
You're the one that can save Micah. 
He's gonna get killed if he goes alone. 
Please. 
Wait. 
Two-pointer for Vladimir Radmanovic. 
Everything's under control, Mr. Linderman. 
He's a good kid. 
Not that I mind the babysitting, but don't you think this is a waste of my talent? 
Thanks. 
No, I appreciate that, I do. 
I will. 
Who was on the phone? 
It was Mr. Linderman. 
He wanted to make sure that you were ready for tomorrow. 
Isn't that nice? 
Mom, I don't like Mr. Linderman. 
Well, why not? 
I don't know, He smells funny. 
Mom, I don't like it here. 
I don't want to do this. 
Micah... 
I want to go home. Mr. Linderman helped us, and now we have to help him. 
That's the last that I want to talk about it, okay? 
But, Mom, I just don't... 
Micah, that's enough. 
You know that I would never let anything bad happen to you, right? 
Give me a smile. 
It's good to see you again, Professor. 
So, have you thought about my offer? 
Are you ready to come to work for us? 
As far as I can tell, you're all a bunch of untrustworthy Gundas. 
Is that a NO? 
No, I'm not going to work for you... you're going to work for me. 
You're going to show me everything you do, everything you know, and I'm going to use it to help me stop Sylar. 
And why would I do that? 
You raided my father's office in Chennai, planted Eden as my next door neighbor. 
You want what I have... the formula. 
I can find more of them. 
You're the one who needs me. 
Some people died because you led Sylar right to them. 
And now you blame yourself, so you become a vigilante. 
Hmm, that's cute. 
Is that a" NO"? 
What choice do I have? 
Come on in. 
What is this place? 
There's someone you need to meet. 
Molly Walker. 
Does the name ring any bells? 
Yeah, she was on my father's list. 
That's right. 
Your father led Sylar right to her. 
He slaughtered her parents, then attacked her. 
How did she survive? 
Well, luckily, we got to her. 
That's what we do. 
We find people with abilities, help them, protect them. 
And she's sick, isn't she? 
How can you tell? 
Her nucleotides are decomposing. 
You need to get her to a doctor. 
A doctor can't help her. 
I'm thinking maybe you can. 
I'm a geneticist. 
I wouldn't know the first thing about this. 
Molly's virus is very rare. 
It's destroying her nervous system. 
Prevents her from accessing her ability. 
There's been one other case. 
An Indian girl, 1974. 
My sister. 
Shanti died. 
Yes, we know. 
Sadly, your father developed a cure months too late. 
Unfortunately for Molly, our people can't figure out what that cure is. 
Cute, huh? 
You're trying to manipulate me? 
Showing me this poor girl, preying on Shanti's memory. 
Sylar is out there, and he's planning a slaughter. 
Everyone is in danger, and this... none of this is going to help. 
You just don't get it. 
Molly is the only one who can stop Sylar. 
It's me. 
I know it's been a while, but I've been thinking about things. 
Thinking about the future- - my future. 
I know it's last minute, but if I could just come talk to you. 
Can I come over? 
Great. 
I'll see you soon. 
I can hear you. 
Whoever you are... come on out. 
You do that again, I will kill you. 
You're lucky I didn't leave your ass stuck in the wall after what you've done. 
What the hell is this place? 
It's where Linderman restores his art. 
He usually hangs out in here. 
What's that? 
Is that supposed to be... 
Micah? 
Where is he? 
I don't know, New York, maybe? 
Her fourth grade report card. 
Niki's immunization records. 
School photos and medical files. 
He's tracked our entire life. 
This finally makes sense. 
No. 
No, this is crazy. 
Nobody does what you and I can do... what Micah can do... 
Nobody. 
My life. 
Me and Niki, everything we had, it was... it wasn't real. 
It was all Linderman's science experiment. 
All this time Linderman's just been playing with our lives. 
What are you doing? 
Linderman obviously isn't here. 
We're wasting our time. 
If Linderman knows this much about us, he must know something about Micah. 
Where he went, what he's doing. 
Linderman went to New York. 
Some note about Petrelli on election day. 
We find Linderman, we find Micah. 
Let's get Micah the hell out of there. 
Hi, Molly. 
I'm Dr. Suresh, and I need to take some blood, if that's okay. 
Molly, I want to stop the man who hurt your family, and who tried to hurt you. 
You can't stop the Boogeyman. 
He sees into your soul, and then he eats your brain. 
Well, you know who can stop the boogeyman? 
You. 
I hear you have an amazing ability. 
It's not so amazing. 
They ask me where people are, and I find them. 
You find them? 
Anywhere in the world? 
Yeah, I just think about them, and then I know where they are. 
But it doesn't work right now. 
Well, that is a very special ability, Molly. 
Because the boogeyman, he likes to hide. 
But if you can tell us where he is, we can make sure he never comes back again. 
You're different from the other doctors. 
You're much better at this. 
Thanks. 
You're telling me, this guy Ted Sprague blew up your house? Yeah, pretty much. 
Don't you see this, Nathan? 
Maybe I'm not the bomb. 
Maybe this guy Ted Sprague is. 
Maybe we can stop him. 
You said you had a dream that you blew up New York City. 
Yeah, I also dreamed that I could fly. We know how that turned out for you. 
You can fly? 
That's cool. 
The election is tomorrow. Pick up the phone, call the FBI. 
We need to find him. 
Nathan... trust me. 
I'll make a few calls. 
Claire. 
You've been through a lot. 
You're very brave. 
I just want you to know that I admire that. 
Mr. Linderman, we have a problem. 
Oh, thank you, Lord, for bringing my Gabriel home safe. 
Hi, Mom. 
Huh? 
Thank you, Lord. 
Oh... Come in, come in. 
If I'd known you were coming, I would have straightened up more. 
Um, I brought it from Texas. 
It's... For your collection. 
perfect! 
One more, and I have the continent. 
I'm just missing Oregon. 
I hear it's beautiful there. 
Green everywhere. 
The clock's broken. 
Oh, that old thing, 
I should have thrown it away years ago. 
It was Dad's. 
It's junk. 
It's a beautiful piece. 
It just needs a little attention. 
I can tell you how proud I am. 
I haven't done anything. 
You've traveled the world. 
Some of us only get to see it in snow globes. 
I'm tired of traveling, I think I might stay here. 
In Queens? 
Why would you ever come back? 
If I stayed, maybe I could stop. 
Maybe I wouldn't have to... 
What? 
Gabriel. 
I'm gonna make you a sandwich. 
You want tuna fish? 
Please don't, I'm not hungry. 
Well... if you insist on staying... 
You should call Mr. Bilger... that man from Smith Barney. 
You fixed his Rolex. 
Why would I call him? 
Because he said you should. 
He said you were very talented, and very special. 
Maybe he could get you a job. 
I have a job. 
I fix watches. 
That's a hobby. 
Investment banking is a very lucrative field. 
I can't be an investment banker. 
You could be anything you want. 
Mom, he wouldn't even remember who I am. 
Who could forget you? 
You're not even listening to me! 
I am listening. 
No. 
You're making a tuna sandwich. 
So? 
I asked you not to. 
I made a mistake. 
I'm sorry! 
Mom... 
Mom, don't. 
Don't, it's just... maybe I don't have to be special. 
That's okay to just be a normal watch-maker. 
Can't you just tell me that's enough? 
Why would I tell you that when I know you could be so much more? 
If you wanted, you could be president. 
What are we doing here? 
Shouldn't we be looking for Ted? 
The FBI and police aren't going to believe us. 
They'll take Nathan seriously, though. He can evacuate the people. 
Wait. 
What? 
What, what, what.... what is it? 
That man. 
That's the man my father works for. 
He's the one I've been running from. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. 
We don't know what's happening in there. 
Linderman doesn't have a grasp on the situation, Thompson. 
All the pundits think I'm gonna lose. 
And this morning my brother tells me about a fella named Ted Sprague--ring a bell? 
We know all about Sprague. 
I don't appreciate being kept in the dark. 
Especially not today. 
Oh, God, I can't believe I've been so stupid. 
My father took a bullet to keep me from that man, and now he's with Nathan. 
It can't be what you think. 
Why do you keep running back to him? 
'Cause he's my brother. 
The truth is, you have no idea what's gonna happen. 
You're nervous. 
Nervous? 
You want to blow up half of New York. 
Yes, we do. 
- You're scared. 
- Yeah, I am. 
I'm terrified. I have to find a nuclear man, and I don't know if I can contain all that power. 
Then run the other way. 
- I can't. 
- Why not? 
Because if we save ourselves, who's gonna save everyone else? 
Why are you asking me to make this sacrifice? 
For the best of reasons. 
You're not alone, Claire. 
You coming? 
No... this is crazy. 
I'm getting out of here. 
Micah, I'm gonna go hop in the shower. 
You gonna be okay? Mm-hmm. 
Hey, Mom, I'm sorry that I talked back to you earlier. 
I know that you just want what's best. 
Thanks. 
Now I got ya. 
Put' em up or I'll blow you to bits! 
Okay, you asked for it. 
Who are you? 
How'd you do that? 
I can make you see anything I want. 
Makes it kind of hard to get away, huh? Now I got ya... 
Where's my mom? 
Look, I don't want to hurt you. 
I like you. 
But if you don't listen to what Mr. Linderman says, well, I'll show you things that'll seriously mess you up for life. 
So you need to behave. 
Okay? 
What if I told you that I can be special? 
Important. 
But to do it, I'd have to hurt a lot of people. Should I? 
You? ! You can never hurt anyone. 
There's a lot of things that I can do that you don't know about. I have something to show you. 
What are you doing? 
I know how much you love snow globes. 
How... how did you... 
Gabriel? 
Gabriel? 
I'm sorry, Molly. 
I didn't mean to frighten you. 
You can't help me either. 
It's okay. 
No, actually, my father did find a cure. 
It's called an Antibody. 
Unfortunately, we don't know where or what it is. 
It's hiding, like the Boogeyman. 
Exactly. 
Who's that? 
It's my sister Shanti. 
She's very pretty. 
This is the first time I've ever seen her. 
She died before I was born. 
Am I going to die? 
Molly, my father did everything he could to save my sister. 
He was just a few months too late. 
I won't be, I promise. 
What's this? 
It'll protect you from the Boogeyman. 
Thank you. 
Please. 
I'm sorry I scared you, just come out and talk to me. 
Please. 
Mom? 
I saw a vision of the future... and I'm gonna kill a lot of people. 
Tell me why I would do that. 
Mom? 
I'm leaving. 
And when I get back, I expect you to be gone. 
Don't say that, Mom. 
- It's me... it's Gabriel. 
- You're not Gabriel. 
You're damned, and I want you out of my house. 
Mom... 
Let go! 
Get away from me! 
Mom, calm down. - Get away! 
- Calm down. 
I want my son. 
What did you do with my son? 
Give me back my boy. 
Mom, please, it's me. 
It's me, Mom, please... 
No. My Gabriel... 
- Mom, stop it, stop it! 
- You're not... you're not! 
- Stop, stop. 
- You're not, you're not! You're not... 
I'm sorry. 
Hyah! That heartbeat... 
You were in the loft. 
Why are you following me? 
I must stop you. 
Then do it. 
Do it! 
Kill me! 
You can't, you coward. 
Now I'm gonna have to kill you. No! 
Hiro! 
You did it. 
You found the cure. 
Where was it? 
It was in me. 
Sometimes... when a mommy and daddy have a sick child, they have another baby. 
A healthy baby with healthy antibodies. 
And if we're very lucky, the healthy baby's blood will heal the sick baby. 
Unfortunately, I was born a little too late to help my sister. 
But I'm not too late to help you. 
You weren't even going to say good-bye? 
Good-bye. 
I think I figured a way for you to save the world. 
A gun? 
That's how I save the world- - that's your plan? 
I can handle Ted. 
But if I lose it, you're the only one who can get close enough to stop me. 
Right through the back of the head. 
You know the spot. 
Same place you pulled the piece of glass from. 
My destiny is not to shoot you. 
The universe cannot be that lame. You cannot run away from who you are, Claire. 
This bomb is happening. 
How can you be so sure? 
Because I can draw the future. 
I met a guy who can do it, now I can do it, you see? 
Someone's gonna blow. 
Me, Ted... 
It doesn't really matter. 
It's happening around the election, unless you stop it. 
That's Ted. 
You drew Ted. 
Are you sure? 
I'll never forget that face. 
That's Kirby Plaza, Midtown. 
Ted is here in New York. 
Don't you see, Claire? You're part of this. 
But you have to do this. 
Thank you, Benjamin. 
What are you doing here? I didn't think I'd see you till later tonight. 
A mother can't be worried about her son on the most important day of his life? 
I was just working on the speech... some details of the concession. 
I'm not talking about the election. 
Linderman called me. 
He said you're getting cold feet. 
It's natural to feel ambivalent. 
Nobody expects you to feel otherwise. 
So I wanted to give you perspective. 
You know about Linderman's plans? 
Yes. 
Well, they're not just Linderman's. A lot of people put time and care into making this a reality. 
Myself included. 
You? 
Yes, you don't know everything about me, Nathan. 
But I do know everything about you. 
And I know what you're capable of. 
Do you think I'm a mass murderer? 
Important men make impossible decisions. President Truman dropped two atomic bombs on Japan to end World War II. 
Killed thousands to save millions. 
That was different, Ma, we were at war. 
I can't accept this. 
That is your one weakness, Nathan... you have no faith. 
So how could you possibly believe this bomb could actually heal the world if you have no faith in the idea of destiny? 
Your destiny, Nathan, is to set the course of history after this unspeakable act has occurred. 
The people will look back on what you do as the freshman congressman from New York, and they will thank you. 
For your strength, for your conviction, for your faith. 
In my day, we called it Being Presidential. 
Can you believe? 
Can you be the one we need? 
That's my boy... 
You were right, Mom. 
I am meant to be special, just like you wanted. 
I can be anything. 
I can even be President. 
There's no sign of him. 
What's wrong? 
I'm not normal. 
I tried to pretend that I was, and I just... hurt everyone. 
My mom, my dad. 
I ruined everything because of what I am. 
I hated it. 
But you... 
When I met you, 
I finally felt like I was a part of something. 
That's funny. 
I felt the same thing when I met you. 
Dad. 
Dad! 
Claire! 
I love you, Claire Bear. 
Claire? 
What's he doing? 
He's absorbing your ability. 
He's gotta make it stop.

- Yes for now but I'm thinking of quitting. Why? It's a great restaurant. 
Well, they gave me the old heave-ho when I told them that I was taking an hour in a interview with the pediatrician. 
It is speackable. 
They act like they support your choice and the as sooner it affects them. They turn on you. 
It is that the truth sister. 
Are you in luck? 
Like just happen that I'm in charge of all the food and beverages at the Montecito. 
Really? 
Sam, I really don't know what you do so I... all right kind of shadow you. 
Shadow me? 
Because a 6.44 ( feet ) man hovering over me in black suite such of this is... ah... spookie. That's a bad idea. 
Why? 
Why. 
I don't care my suite is spookie. 
Keepin' call you" the undertaker".

LAS VEGAS 
Mr. Green welcome to Montecito. 
I've been gone under the Rio for over ten years... Understand that this is just a test? 
Of course I understand. 
I'm a creature of head but I go where I'm confortable and frankely I'm not confortable of many places. 
Well I promise you are going to be comfortable here infact 
I think you were noticed how comes a lot more generous over the Rio. 
Try to get tables? 
Okay, great. 
I had a few things that I've set up for you, I just... 
I think there's something you're gonna be really interesting right on here Mr Green. 
I cant' believe you didnt' tell us.... 
Good for once you can. 
Well I'm telling you now! 
You may have noticed to string a bad look I've been having a woman so 
I just wanna take it slow this time. 
Ok it's full everything. 
- What's her name? 
- Carly... - When do we meet her? 
I do want you to meet her but... 
At lunch? 
- I like lunch. - Yeah. 
Well I kind of had a earlier lunch... 
Then you want to seat? 
All of... we get some table. 
I want it like a little girl... 
Pay attention Piper. 
I like this one much better than the last. 
- Hallo... 
- It ain't gonna happen! 
Why this are nervous, a new casino? 
No, he's a freak. 
All whales are strange. 
Normal people don't have crazy amounts of money without being crazy. 
Except for you of course... sir. 
- Cooper. - Cooper... 
Actually in many ways Ari's being the perfect whale, he shows up seven time a year. 
Cause usually had about two hundred to three hundred on the ground and always pays up before he cheks out. 
Turns up he's not the highest to high rollers but is consistent. 
And he always comes back, even he loses, It's fascinating. 
Of course, he came back, they all come back. 
Like sex, drug, or shopping. 
- It's hide together from Rio. 
- I can't tell you that. 
- Hi... 
- I'm going back to The Rio. 
Oh, of course you're not. Your luck is about to turn. 
Look at this dealer changed. 
I don't like being followed around by people walking over my shoulder. 
My host at the Rio didn't hover. 
Of course not I don't hover, I never hover! 
I linger... just in case you might need something. 
He hovers. 
He stalk and he hovers. 
And he's really spookie. 
Try to run over. 
You know Mr. Green, ah... 
- Excuse me. 
- Yes. Fascinating... 
First time I met Mike, I don't know. He was renting" The Fast and The Furious" n.1, 2 and 3 
I tought to myself" Handsome but not exactly my type". 
I'm not gonna apologize." The Fast and The Furious" is incredible. 
Number one it's a classic 2 and 3 not somewhat meanwhile Carly was holding" The spanish prisoner", so I made up a reason to talk to. 
He ended at dumping the fast and the furious and we watched" The spanish prisoner" together. 
- Can you blame me? 
- Can't sure this. 
Carly, why did you leave Indianapolis? 
Nothing was keeping me there and you can teach almost anywhere. 
- Someone attitude? 
- Nine. 
I love the kids. All of them. Age can be difficult... 
Too cool for school, their hormons are raging. 
(... ) 
I've immediately been a little bit. 
- A little? 
- Danny! 
It's so great having a baby. 
Yeah we are excited. 
You know Mike is gonna be the 
- godfather. - you don't tell me that. 
School practise, for... when it's time for me to start my own family. 
I wanna have a hole house full. 
Me too. 
Honey this is terrible... I know. 
I know, but I'm stealing a new pastry chef from the Winn. 
All right, I want her to come here. 
Why d'you wanna meet her? 
Because, it's our policy. 
I mean, no one's hired or fired without. Department head and presidential approval. 
Did Cooper tell you he was firing Wolfgang? 
No, because he didn't fired him, he quit. 
I shouldn't have to tell you when I hire a new pastry chef. - It's... 
It's... - Why just... Can't you trust my judgement? 
I trust your judjment. It's not... It's not personal, it's just policy. 
You're making it personal for no power, trippy. 
Ok, you know what? This is... It's, it's... 
Great.' Cause she's here. 
I gotta run. 
- Nice to meeting you. 
- You too. 
- Bye Honey. 
- Bye. 
Hey Gretchen. 
You're all set? 
You've had resources, locker, ID? 
I am officially a Montecito employee. 
Can we talk about equipment and supplies? 
Unmotivated topic. 
I picked up everything myself. 
I was afraid of that. 
Uhm, frankly, kitchen is... so poor. 
So poor? 
I mean I would have thought twice about taking the job if I'd known about it's conditions. 
I'm gonna need to bring in some of my own personal equipment and the allow to do shopping on my own. 
Excuse me? 
I spin magic out of sugar, it's my art. 
There is no second best in my world. 
No, no, I know. 
It's just I have no money left in the budget for new equipment, Gretchen, you're gonna need to live whit what's here. 
You're not gonna let the budget affect the quality of the food? ! 
- No! 
- Oh,' cause that's what it sounded like. 
- I... - I thought so. 
Look at you! 
Oh man, fantastic work, she is... 
Hot! 
- Yeah, she's great... 
- Delinda loves her. 
I just feel strange. 
You don't want this normal, you're gonna go through that at first, 
Delinda and I went through the same thing. 
- She's perfect. 
- Yeah, Delinda? 
- I mean, Carley. 
- Right. - We're talking bout Carley 
Hey Piper what's up? Nothing? 
C'mooon! 
Delinda fought the flowers Danny, what the man find glasses I just I wan't see anything. 
Don't even start with thinking this one. - Ok? 
Just go with it. 
- Alright. - I will. 
- I never thought you had it in you. 
I'm proud of you. 
Would jury on this one. 
" LAUDER CARLEY : Deceased" 
This has got to be a joke. 
* I'm gonna make love so sweet * 
* Pour little sugar on me * * Oh yeah! 
* 
* Pour little sugar on me honey * 
* Pour little sugar on me baby * 
* I'm gonna make love so sweet * 
* Pour little sugar on me honey * 
- * You are my candy, girl * - Gretchen. 
- * And you got me wanting you * - Gretchen! 
Gretchen! 
What are those? 
Lemon bars. 
But the dessert is supposed to complement the Halloween special, 
I thought we agreed on Halloween cupcakes. 
You may have agreed on cupcakes, but I didn't. 
What? 
Cupcakes are for children's birthday parties, Lemon bars are not. 
- But I like cupcakes. 
- Not my problem. 
The head chef and I determined the menu, it's not open to interpretation. 
Yeah, well, your head chef would no good at cooking if you hate it. 
That's not the issue, you're undermining my authority. 
I'm just an artist trying to do the best work that I can do. 
It's like I'm the painter, and you run the gallery. 
So let me hang my beautiful paintings on your expensive walls. 
Delinda, let 
ME hang them. 
Okay... 
- Where is everybody? 
- They all quit. 
What? 
Hello. 
I'm sorry about your whale. 
Ok. 
It's that it? 
You're upset with me. 
I costed you a client, affected your budget. 
Oh, I'll get over. 
Are... This are your lemon bars? 
Yeah they're a gift from the new pastry chef. 
Have one. 
This are amazing. 
I wanna make it up to you. 
- That's not necessary. 
- Oh it is necessary. 
Put me in your private poker game, and you're missing a player, and, uhm, just thinking" you know". 
If you really like to make it up to me, that you should probably also step my buy-in. 
You know how to play poker? 
I'm great at poker. 
Ok, my suite, eight o'clock. 
I hope you are something Piper. 
Oh, Damnit. 
Please don't tell me you had thought you've tell me something on your new girlfriend. 
I did. 
Did something happened? - Yeah. 
- Since lunch? 
- Did a background check on her. 
- Yeah, and let me guess, you found something. 
Well, only that she doesn't exist. 
She did, 1965. 
But she died at birth. 
You obviously looked at the wrong Carley Lauder. No. 
There's gotta be a mistake, or... 
Some kind of explanation. 
We both know that the only people who steal identities are scammers and thieves, she probably targeted me. 
Head of surveillance and security, make sense. 
Ok, ok before you jump to the conclusion, maybe you should TALK to her. 
I'm gonna break it off, with this, but not with you. 
Where did you get that? 
Mmh? 
Oh, Cooper's office, he had a gift basket. 
I can't believe that Bess told her to do all that lemon bars behind my back.. 
Yeah it sound like a serious problem but guess what? 
Cooper invited me to play poker with him and his rich friends. 
- Cooper invited you? 
- Mmh-mmh, private game. 
Are you for that? 
Doesn't really matter because he's gonna step my buy-in. 
Best-case scenario, is that I win a bunch of money, worst-case scenario is that I loose all his money and walk away. 
Why would they invited you for a game if you weren't sleeping with them? 
Oh, out of guilt,' cause he owes me. 
Not as intresting, but i believe you. 
- Wanna bite? 
- Never. 
Never will these lemon bars touch these lips. 
Ah, ok, well, you stick to those conditio-HEY! 
How' bout a little loyalty? 
Hi Piper. 
Come on! 
- I don't feel anything. 
- Yeah, put your hands a little low. 
Guys? 
Hey? - Wake up! 
- Oh there it is. 
Oh my God that's amazing. 
I never felt a baby move before, it's so cool! 
- Hey baby! - What's going on? 
- Oh I'm just letting Danny feel the babies' kicks. 
Do you know that she's having two boys? 
Oh and she's brought these, lemon bars, have one, they're really good. 
- See? 
- I see! 
Could you excuse us? 
Sure. I need to get back to the... anyway 
- Danny it was so nice to meet you. 
- Me too. 
There they kick again. 
What? 
You're late. 
I was totally thinking you stood me up. 
I'd like we should end this. What? 
Ahah! Trick or treath, this is a trick. 
I thought everything was going so well. 
It was. 
It's just not gonna work out. 
Ok, if that's what you want? 
- Did I do something wrong? - Yeah. 
Yeah you did, you lied to me. 
You don't have to come back for that one? 
Another lie, the pal on the first one, maybe? 
No? 
Hey baby! 
Now who the hell are you? 
Who the hell are YOU? 
I'm her husband. 
- I'm disappointed, Katie. - Katie? 
I've been looking for you all this time and you're not happy to see me. 
- Hold on. 
- Talking to my wife, I'm not talking to you. 
- Tell him, Kate. 
- He's my husband. 
Time to start packing. 
- I said go pack, vacation's over. 
- Hey, Hey! 
You touch her, you have to deal with me. 
Are you protecting a lying, cheating whore? 
I suggest you leave. 
I'll be back later, alright? 
You got till ten, anything you don't pack, we leave. 
It would be a major mistake, to come between a man and his wife. 
And I DO mean major. 
- An alias? 
- Yeah Mike just called. 
- I'm sure there is an explanation. 
- She's obviusly hiding something. 
I had a good feeling about her. I had a good feeling about her. - Me too. 
- This is the 2th time my instinct fail me today. 
- The 2th time? 
- Gretchen. 
- She's so fired. 
- What? 
Because I touched her belly? No, no, it's not that. 
Otherwise, I hate. 
God, it's just... She's awful. 
I can't work with her, Danny, she's obnoxious. 
Baby, you just hired her. 
And she's pregnant, have you any idea how bad this gonna make us look? 
I'm gonna find her doing it. 
A pregnant woman firing a pregnant woman. It's only balance! 
Hey, you're her boss. 
You need to sit down and talk to her. 
Employer to employee, explain to her exactly what she's doing wrong and what she needs to do to change. 
Ok, give her a chance to make things right, that's what a good boss does. 
She is a good cook. 
- Does he feel that? 
- Give it up, McCoy. 
Get out of my face, Piper. 
- What are you supposed to be? 
- A plaguer! 
A big... plaguer! 
it's all right I give up. 
So I bet them, and I've been raising speedballs ever since. 
Wow, that's impressive. 
Say that after you see him in play. 
Okay. 
Famous five cards draw, gots to open thousand dollar, any no limit, yellows are thousand reds five... 
Blue is ten, we got it. 
Just to you. 
Those nineteen all five play it alls wider or a pews to home. 
Well, I happen to be carrying my 1895 Morgan's silver dollar. 
- For luck. 
- A' 95 Morgan? 
Where d'you get this? 
A whale left it to me and it's well to read the bad. 
Hundred thousand dollars. 
What about twenty give her take. 
Oh, bets to you, Larry. 
Hell... I fold. 
He always folds the first hand. 
Doesn't make any different so long as I win the last one. 
Yeah, well I bet two grand. 
I see your two grand. 
may you should ten. 
Bold move out of the gate. 
Uh, you know some people like to tip tap toe on the water. I jump at first. 
I'm out. 
Yeah, get off. 
Nice job. You... a solid looser like casher with a shark. 
This game was luck. 
I'm sorry. 
I was just trying to start over but I guess that's not gonna happen now. 
There's an outside who observe, let me set on think you shouldn't go anywhere with him. 
And Tim never gives up. 
Last time it comes eight months to find me, this time it was only four. 
I'm sorry I drag you into this. 
No one drags me anywhere, 
And no one drags you anywhere either. 
- You will stay at the Montecito. 
- You should not get involved in this, Micheal. 
You'll have protection 24 / 7. 
And that will give us time to restrain all this out. 
Us? 
Mike, I lied to you. 
You had a pretty good reason. 
Thank you! 
- Too sweet for me. 
- Yeah, me too, bitter sweet. 
I raise you two. 
I'll see your two. 
- I'm raising you, twenty. 
- All at the warm times. 
Boy, I guess you gonna be sorry to miss this one. 
- Bets to you, Sam, you in? 
- I have a good feeling. - So do I. 
- You're bluffing. 
No shame on fold, Sam. 
Look to play another day. 
I fold. 
You did the right thing here, nobody bets when he's on the street. 
- Yeah, well, I need a refresh here. - Yeah, me too, I got to go to the can. 
What do you say we take a break? 
- Could we a little beater was. 
- Nothing, I was bluffing. 
Gretchen? I need to talk with you. 
Sure! 
Are you feeling okay? 
Me? 
I'm great. 
This is about you. 
Look, I know you're very good at what you do, and clearly everyone loves your lemon bars, but 
I don't know why you disobeyed my orders againg and, frankly Gretchen, I don't like your tone. 
I mean I'm sure you don't really meant to be so offensive but... 
Oh dear... 
What? 
Well, it's been a couple of months, but I do remember that hormonal surge. 
I'm not hormonal, Gretchen! 
I'm giving you a sincere evaluation of your work. 
You need what you need? 
A lemon bar. 
I don't need a lemon bar! 
Oh my God... 
She's so good. 
I hate her... 
I hate her. 
Mitch. 
Oh, I was just checking a zone since crazy Halloween... 
What said that door anyone goes around you call me gone to immediate light, you understand? 
Yeah, you'll got. 
- What's going on? 
- Talk to Carley, her real name's Katie. 
- And? 
- She's on a run. 
Abusive husband. 
- That's not good. - No. 
It's not good that he found her tonight. 
So I put her in a room, checked-in on a different name. 
Ok, how long you plan to keep her here? 
How long to takes me to take along her husband. 
Uh Mikey, this is a domestic situation, you can't put the Montecito in the middle of... 
He beat her, Danny! 
Alright. 
Alright, how can I help? 
This is my problem. 
I said that's your first and last warning. 
Get out of Vegas. 
Forget about Katie. 
You did this to the wrong guy! 
You heard me? 
You did this to the wrong guy! 
I'm coming up to you! 
And you don't coming up to her! 
I hate her, but I ain't hate anybody this woman I hate. 
Right. 
Who? - Gretchen! 
- Gretchen... 
First Danny wouldn't let me hire her and now wouldn't let me fire her! - Mmm... right. 
- Terrible. 
Yeah I think he's a bitch like me at the poker table, he blow tonight felt for it. 
Good news is I know his tell. 
Can I get a water? 
Can I get a double shot of espresso and a lemon bar? 
- You gettin' a lemon bar? - Mm-hm. 
- Right in front of me? 
- Yeah. 
Can't open I need it. 
Can I borrow some money? 
What for? 
What you mean" for"? 
five back into the game I just got to tell you, you know, I know Cooper's tell. 
You're eating a lemon bar and trying to borrow money from me at the same time. 
- Figure it out. 
How's that? 
- Better. 
- If I'll give you the money I want something to return. 
- Name it. 
Tell me how to get ready Gretchen technically fired without sabotaging the restaurant. 
That's easy, find her a better job somewhere so nothing lets can deal with her. 
- Simply but brilliant. How much money? 
- Seventy five. 
- Thousand? 
- No, cents. 
- Seventy five thousand dollars? 
- Yes, please. 
- Who is it? 
- It's Mike. 
- You scared me. 
- I taked care of it. 
I don't think your husband's gonna bother you again. 
You didn't do anything crazy? 
Well let's just say I give him an ample motivation to leave you alone. 
You don't know Tim like I do. 
He'd do anything to get to me, I don't think he's ever gonna give up. 
Did you ever go to the police? 
To press charges? 
I did once. 
They held him over night, and then they released him next morning. 
And when he got home... 
- I don't want him to hurt you, Mike. 
- Don't worry about me. 
Just stay here, enjoy yourself. 
Let me take care. 
What is it? 
It's a signal business, I shouldn't take you home what did your room service, got your satellite Tv, six ond the thread... sheets. 
Uh, nice bottle of wine in the minibar. 
You relax, don't worry about the thing. 
- Okay? 
- Okay. 
He asked for her to the registration desk, they told him that she wasn't a registered guest here. 
Where is he now? 
We passed on the lobby for ten minutes then he made his way over the sportbowl. 
I fear I ask you to leave. 
Wh? 
I'm doing anything, I'm just having a beer. 
This's private property, we can refuse service to anyone, for any reason, out! 
But I ain't done with my beer. 
- You problem? 
- No. Just throwing out some trash. 
- Yeah a fight your own bellows. 
- I'm not scared of a man to beats some women. 
Well it's a tougth talk coming from the guy who jumps people in the dark. 
Better let them out take it easy, Fella, I wasn't really an idiot. 
It's under control. 
- Six here to call, Sam. 
- I'm gonna sure. 
How you're sure? 
- About 40 grand? 
- Call it forward. What's it gonna be? 
How about my car? 
Blue book is 55. 
I drive American. 
You should fold. 
Sam... 
That coin's worth a lot more than your bet. 
I think you should fold. 
I bet you do. 
Lucky coin is in. 
Oh, four ladies! 
Straight flush to six. 
I guess it's my lucky coin now. 
Mike, if this is getting out of hand, I need to know about it. 
It's not out of hand, I got it under control. 
Kitty can't stay in this hotel room forever. 
Eventually she's gotta leave. 
- And then what? 
- I don't know. 
You need to go to the police. 
I've done my research on spousal abuse Danny. 
A restraining order is only piss guys off more. 
Why don't you get out of here. 
Take the rest of the night off. 
I have thought about it. 
Does a magicician give away his tricks? 
I mean, does an artist explain how they turn a lump of clay into a sculpture? 
It's just pie. 
Just pie? Is it Marie Callendar's people? 
Hey guys, It's Delinda. 
Listen, I hear you guys are opening a new restaurant next month. 
I know the most amazing pastry chef. 
This is a tangerine meringue chocolate souffle. 
What do you mean you heard she's crazy? 
No honey, she's as sweet as lemon bars. Hello? 
Hello? 
Is Lil' Flower in? 
Hey, man, I don't want to talk about it, alright? 
Tomorrow I need my money man. 
Oh, baby! 
- What's up Lil' Flower? 
- Long time no see, Mike. - What's goin' on, man? 
Hold on man why you don't... 
- It all depends if you got what I need. 
- If I got... 
What you need? 
I got I-pod, I got a new I-phone. I'll give it to you for 400 dollars. 
It's all bargain over here. 
I need a gun. 
- You, you need a gun? 
- You got a problem with that? 
No, man, it's just... it's just very rare that I sell a gun to a pretty clean cut like yourself man. 
I mean, I got hand-guns and machine-guns, you give me a couple of days and I can get you a brand new RPG. 
I need it now. 
Let me see your gun man. 
C'mon man, why are you acting slow, what's up? 
Yo, man, this is the best I can do for you right now.

Ok, nice doing business with you Mike. 
You make sure you keep this between you and me. 
- We're clear? 
- Crystal, man. 
- Like the champagne, right? 
- It's Cristal. 
Hi Mike, I love you darling. 
Stay safe for me. 
Come on, men, get to work. 
What's up baby? Whacha you do, noboby uses VCR no more! 
- Hey wife beater. - What do you want? 
I'm all alone, nobody to back me up, are you man enough... to take on somebody who is back. 
- Bring it, bitch. 
- Yeah, I'll bring it. 
I saw it in the dining section of the paper and I just wanted to say congratulations. 
What a great opportunity, Craig... 
Oh, well, thank you. 
Danny and I are really excited. 
Listen... I just wanted to send you a little something. A congratulations gift. 
I know this amazing pastry chef... Okay. 
You too. 
Bye bye. 
Go, like the wind. 
That's really got her, right? 
Is that all you got? 
Come on! 
Where's that bitch wife of mine? 
Somewhere you're never gonna find. 
I see why you fight with women... 
You hit like a girl. 
Hey how is this? 
Police, put the gun down! 
Put the gun down! 
Put it down. 
Put the hands on your head. 
Get down on your knees, now. 
You're dead. 
That bitch is too. 
Thanks for coming all this way. 
I had one hell of a time. 
Yeah, let's do this more often. 
Yeah, and if you don't mind, we would love to come back to Vegas. 
Oh, yeah, Larry got himself a phone number. 
Oh, then anything can happen. 
You seeing anyone? No. 
Yeah, well, in due time, don't rush it. 
Hey, uh, what about Sam? 
Anything going on there? 
Absolutely not. 
No kidding. 
What a shame. 
I wonder if she likes speed boats. 
Listen, there is a limo waiting for you guys downstairs to take you to the airport. 
Well, you take care Cooper. 
So long, big guy. 
Take care. 
He planted a gun on me, why don't you take my statement? 
There are people out there taking his statement. 
Why won't you take mine? Why won't you take my statement? 
He was at the Montecito earlier I don't remind. 
I was driving home after my shift and I noticed someone was following... 
So I pulled over, turned head and that was him. 
I know where you're at... 
And he started beating me and he pulled the gun. 
- I guess he was mad... at the Montecito. 
- He does have priors. - Spousal abuse. 
- Really? Wow. 
- Hey, you ok? 
- Yeah. - Yeah, I'm fine, man. 
Don't worry about it. 
- Alright Mr. Cannon, I'll keep in touch. - You'll run for questions? 
- You know where find me. 
What happened? 
What had to happen. 
You know, he's only gonna do a few years at most. 
And he's gonna come after her again. 
I know. 
I really hate to leave you alone, but, I can't pass that Casey call me personally. 
Gretchen, don't apologize. 
It's a much better opportunity. It's better everything. 
I mean, no offence. 
None taken. 
- So... Wish me luck. 
- Break a leg. 
- Literally. 
- She just quits? 
Craig fisics stole her away from me. 
Go figure. 
- Didn't you use to date him once? - Yeah. 
Sure I did. 
And there's nothing he deserves more than Gretchen. 
Go change into your costume. - Hey guys. 
- Piper? 
Nice costume. 
When in doubt, dress as a hooker. 
These are my street clothes. 
Sorry. You look hot. 
I don't know how you did this. 
All you need to know is that Tim is going away. 
For how long? 
Probably years. 
But he'll come after me when he's out. 
You need to disappear. 
But I don't wanna disappear, Mike. I wanna stay here with you. 
I know someone who can help. 
- Please Mike, don't make me do this. 
- You won't have to run anymore. 
- Promise? 
- I promise. 
I love you. 
I love you too. 
Hello, the car is waiting. 
You're doing the right thing, Mike. 
I know this doesn't help much, but... 
I know how you feel. 
Desto Presented Las Vegas S05E06 
Previously on Las Vegas... 
Your uncle Luke. 
Never heard from the guy in like 25 years. He suddenly shows up out of the blue? 
I've been clean and sober for over two years now. 
Run a background check on my uncle Luke, will you? 
You think he's up to something? 
I happen to be carrying my 1895 morgan silver dollar. 
One of my high rollers left it to me in his will. 
Lucky coin is in. 
I guess it's my lucky coin now. 
All right, there's three whales who need my attention. 
Guys who actually spend money. 
And instead, he has me babysitting some redneck from Texas. 
Suck on this... 
Till I get back. 
People are entitled to be treated with decency and respect. 
You're fired. 
Danny boy! 
Bob Casey. 
How you been? 
Smell that? 
Yeah, it smells like oranges. 
Danny, what's goin' on? 
They're gassing' the casino. 
All clear. 
Pull' em off, boys. 
Stay down. 
Least till the docs get a look at you. 
Where's Luke? 
I'm okay, Danny. 
How long was I out? 
Everybody down here's been out at least 40 minutes. 
I smelled something'. 
It was like orange. 
I think that it was fentanyl. 
I'm guessing the same thing. 
- I'm gonna have to call metro. 
- They're already here. 
So is the ATF, FBI, ICE, HSA, and every other Fed with initials in their name. 
We've got approximately 1, 000 down on the casino floor. 
They're all regaining consciousness. 
No fatalities. 
- You okay? 
- Yeah. 
Just stay down a minute. 
Let him get up if he wants to. 
You okay? 
What'd they get? 
Everything we had on the floor and in the cage. 
Give or take $ 30 million. 
I should get back there. 
Thank god they made you come home, Danny. 
I mean, you could been killed. 
Nobody got killed, Dee. 
Are you sure you're okay? 
Yeah. 
I'm fine. 
What about tomorrow or the next day? 
W... 
As far as I know, Fentanyl doesn't have any lasting effects. 
If just feels like a-A hangover. 
That's all. 
What about uncle Luke? 
Considering a hangover's been his natural state for the last 20 years, I think he's fine. 
God. 
This is all so crazy. 
What about poor Sam? 
I mean, first Cooper kicks her to the curb, and now this. 
There's not gonna be any jobs in this town. 
- What do you think she's gonna do? 
- I don't know. 
I can hear you. 
- Coach is like two feet from your bed. 
- Sorry, Sam. 
Let me tell you guys something. 
Sam Marquez is like a cat. 
You know what that means? 
You know what cats do? 
Cats land on their feet. 
- Why are you talking in the third person? 
- I'm very tired. 
Let me tell you something else. 
You two are the ones I'm worried about. 
Do you want to know why? 
Because you work at the Montecito. 
And the Montecito just happens to be in big trouble. 
You think people are just gonna show up at the Montecito tomorrow and act like nothing's happening? 
And I don't really give a crap, because I'll have a better job than this in like 24 hours. 
Watch me. 
Las Vegas S5E10" The High Price of Gas" 
- = D e S t o Production = - 
Vic Jacobs. 
Special agent in charge. 
FBI. 
- You're clear to reopen. 
- Thank you for making it happen so quickly. 
KellI rome. 
Homeland security. 
Uh, have a seat. 
So you think this might be terrorists? 
We don't know what to think yet. 
Well, as far as I know, Al-Qaeda kills people. 
They don't put them to sleep and rob them. 
Look, we're not ruling out anything at this point. 
You were the only one to come into direct physical contact with the perpetrators. 
Surveillance video indicates that you grabbed at one of' em before you went down. 
Yeah, I grabbed one, but all I got was his arm. 
How do you know it was a man? 
Because it was. 
And if it wasn't, it was the hairiest girl's arm on the planet. 
I-I-I think that I saw somethin' on his forearm. 
A scar? 
A tattoo maybe? 
Yeah, I can't remember. 
It just happened so quick. 
- Then the gas got you. 
- Yeah. 
Everyone else on the floor was already out. 
Casino security was down. 
It's impressive you got as far as you did. 
Yeah, well, when I see these guys again, trust me, they're not getting away. 
I can understand why you might take this personally. 
But here's the bottom line. 
We'll find out who did this. 
So you don't have to. 
Do we understand each other? 
Yeah, if I remember anything, you're the first number I'll call. 
Our federal friends found no fingerprints or DNA anywhere on the truck. 
- These guys were very careful, very deliberate. 
- A vin number, engine number, anything? 
They're there, but they don't match. 
Looked like the truck was cobbled together from junkyard parts. 
And no rentals matching this description have been reported missing anywhere in the country. 
This is where they disabled the ventilation system. 
Well, they knew exactly where to hit us. 
What about the planning commission or building and safety? 
Somewhere to get a... A blueprint. 
Already checked. All this was built after the Montecito was remodeled two years ago. 
They're not even on file with the county. 
- You're still trying to figure out what you saw on that guy's arm? 
- This is bad, Mikey. 
Really bad. 
- You think we shoulda seen it coming? 
- Well, we got money. 
Bad guys want money. 
- It was bound to happen somewhere. 
- Why the Montecito? 
Because we got the best security on the strip, and nobody thought somebody's gonna try something this big and get away with it. 
- But they did. 
On my watch. 
- On our watch. 
They're disaster junkies. 
Oklahoma city. 9 / 11. 
Katrina. 
They want to be the first on the ground where the bad thing happened. 
How'd they get here so fast? 
Well, my people are tapped into the blogosphere 24 / 7. 
- Getting the word out to niche markets like this. 
- Really. 
They spend on average 40 % more per visit than your typical guest. 
I don't want this clientele in my casino. 
You paid me to manage a crisis. 
And the first thing we have to do is repopulate the hotel. 
Not everything we do is gonna be a homerun. 
I'm checking in today. 
Liz Barrett. 
Hello, Ms. Barrett. 
You must be Steve's wife. 
I'm Piper. 
I apologize for the chaos around here. 
Things are just starting to get back to normal. 
You know, Steve always said," Liz, the Montecito is just like cheers." 
Where everybody knows your name. 
Let me get this bag for you. 
" Always someone to help you there, Liz, just like family." 
- Wow, you didn't carry this all by yourself, did you? 
- Well, I figured I should. 
There's a million dollars in there. 
Will Steve be joining us later today? 
No. 
Steve's dead. 
Thanks, it means a lot. 
All the owners have pledged their support. 
They've also agreed not to hire Samantha Marquez. 
I can't let her take our biggest customers to the competition. 
Yeah, I heard you made a few phone calls regarding Sam. 
I also heard you hired a disaster consultant. 
Ted Leandros, he's supposed to be the best. 
Look, Mike, I know she's a friend. 
This is business. 
So I need a list of her whales, and I'll call them all personally. 
Actually, there is no list. 
That's ridiculous. 
You're telling me the Montecito doesn't have a list of its biggest gamblers. 
Well, casino services may have a few business numbers and some banking information, but traditionally, only the casino host has direct contact info. 
Well, get me what you got. 
George Maloof, please. 
Sam Marquez. 
Uh, George! 
Hi, it's Sam. 
This is your lucky day. 
Mike Cannon? 
Ted Leandros, A.J. Cooper retained my services to help manage the event. 
How'd you get in here? 
Oh, uh, Cooper gave me a all-Access pass, so to speak. 
Yeah, I know who you are." The master of disaster." 
Not a moniker I'd choose for myself, but, eh, appropriate, I suppose. 
Well, now that we have all the pleasantries out of the way. Can we talk about the elephant in the room? 
- I'm sorry. 
- Al-Qaeda. 
Everyone's thinking it, but no one's saying it. 
There's absolutely no evidence that this is terrorism related. 
Yet. 
As chief of security, you need to get the FBI or homeland security to say just that. 
Publicly. 
Today. 
All due respect, Mr. Leandros, I'd like to help you manage the public relations of the situation, but I'm kinda busy right now. 
What you don't understand, Mr. Cannon, is that in a post-Disaster environment, perception is reality. 
Uh, my perception is Mr. Cooper would like me to find out who did this, and quickly. 
Someone's gonna get caught. 
Someone always does. 
And I really don't give a rat's rectum who it is. 
You see, my job is to restore the perception that the Montecito is once again open and a safe place to come gamble and lose your money. 
But if those same nice folks think that terrorists did this... 
Well, you can just pass out hundred-Dollar bills like christmas candy, and you would still have no takers. 
This hotel will stay empty. 
And you will go back to parking cars. 
Most likely at a skin joint up in Henderson. 
If you're lucky. 
Now, are you gonna help me, or not? 
What's the latest from the FBI? 
They got nothing. 
- Don't ever say" nothing" to the press. 
- Wha... 
It's the truth. 
No, the answer is that we have persons of interest on our radar. 
We're confident that an arrest is imminent. 
Well, we don't. And it isn't. 
Let's be careful about using words like" imminent." 
In the absence of any credible lead, I think less is more. 
Copy that. 
We'll go dark on the investigation for 24 hours. 
What about the gas residue? 
Uh, fentanyl dissipates within minutes. 
There isn't any. 
I didn't see a phd in gaseous diffusion on your resume. 
I was down there. 
I'm not an idiot, I... 
You're both professionals. 
I expect you to act like it. 
Call a press conference, I wanna make a statement. 
First of all, I'd like to thank the people of Las Vegas for their prayers. 
And I'd like thank the owners of the major properties for their help and support. 
Next, I would like everyone to know that the Montecito... 
In fact, this entire city, is open for business. 
Mr. Cooper, do you have any suspects? 
This is Danny McCoy, our president of operations. 
Danny! 
Danny! 
Uh, Montecito security is working hand in hand with those local and federal agencies. 
Mr. Cooper just mentioned to bring... 
To bring the people who did this to justice. 
We understand you've got no leads at all. 
What's your response to that? 
Uh, you're absolutely right, Ted. 
We have no leads. 
We understand there have already been hundreds of lawsuits filed against the Montecito. 
- For what? 
- Negligence. 
And now you say you don't have a single lead on the people who gassed and robbed your casino? 
The Montecito has the finest security on the strip. 
Our doors are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. 
And we do everything... 
Everything that we can within the law and within reason, to keep the people who stay here, to keep our guests completely safe. 
Now, in a free society, it's easy for bad people to do bad things. 
So if any of those people are watching right now, hear this : 
We're coming for you. 
So I video iq'd these guys from every angle and we still can't see through their masks. 
Anything new on prints or DNA? 
Well, I struck up a collegial relationship with the FBI evidence tech, Alexandra. 
- I'm glad you've still got your priorities straight. 
- Well, on the qt, she said no prints, no hair, no fibers. 
So they got nothing. 
Go back to the video, follow Danny. 
Double speed, reverse. 
Okay, so here he is with his uncle Luke. 
Stop. 
Luke made him go back in. 
We're coming for you? 
- Yeah, it was a little much. 
- You think? 
Heard you wrecked the press conference, McCoy. 
Bet that spin doctor almost crapped his $ 2, 000 suit. 
We're gonna need some data. 
Everyone who's checked in and out of this hotel since the remodel two years ago. 
We've already run that. 
There were no patterns, nothing stood out. 
You think they didn't need a hotel room because they were local. 
You don't mind if we do our own analysis, though, do you? 
Absolutely not. 
Would you like a hard copy or flash drive? 
Both. 
Well... knock yourself out. 
- Hey, George. 
- Hi. 
- Heard Cooper put a bowling alley in his suite. - Yeah. 
Where do you think he got that idea from? 
Well, we've had the basketball suite a few years. 
Yeah, well, the Montecito is so... 
Yesterday, and the Palms is so clearly... 
Tomorrow. 
A.J. Cooper called me and told me not to hire you. 
Quite frankly, Sam, he scares me a little. 
I think it'd be a good idea to let this whole thing just blow over. 
I am so, so sorry for your loss. 
Steve loved you, Mike. 
He used to pick you up in a big bear hug whenever you opened his door at the valet. 
You were a valet? 
Well, he loved everyone at the Montecito, Liz. 
Do you mind me asking, uh, how it happened? 
He was base jumping at angel falls in Venezuela. 
- Oh, my gosh. 
- Oh, no. 
No, he made it. 
When he was returning his parachute, he got hit by an ice cream truck. 
Steve wanted to be buried here. 
Well, there are several beautiful cemeteries nearby. 
Piper will be happy to help you with that. 
Oh, no, no. 
Here. 
At the Montecito. 
This was his favorite place in the world. 
In the hotel. 
- Uh... 
I'm not sure if that's even legal. 
- I'll pay a million dollars. 
Let me look into that. 
- What about green valley ranch and red rock? 
- No and no. 
Cooper's blackballing me all over town. 
Gotta hand it to him, though. 
He's playing the sympathy card for this gas attack thing for all it's worth. 
Smart. 
- Maybe you should just apologize, Sam. 
- Apologize. 
Fat chance. 
It doesn't even matter. 
The Montecito's over. 
No one's gonna want to go back there. 
Every... I'm just saying that, you know, wherever I land, 
I'll put in a good word for you and Danny and Mike, and everything's gonna be just fine. 
Wait. 
Wait. 
What about that new place downtown? 
- Downtown? 
- No, not... 
Not hooters. 
Um... a lotta kids go there late after mystique. 
Shooters? 
- Cancellations are at 50 % at my place, and rising. 
- Mine too. 
The airport's a frigging ghost town. 
I'm telling you, if this turns out to be Al-Qaeda, we're all sunk. 
It's not Al-Qaeda, Barry. 
Nobody got killed, for crying out loud. 
I like these panels. 
What is that, walnut? 
Now, normally I know you'd all be looking for a way to kick us when we're down, but we're all in this together, right? 
That... 
Is rapidly becoming you. 
So I called the presidents of operations from every major hotel on the strip here today because I have an idea, but I-I just need your help. 
- What do you want us to do? 
- Eat breakfast. 
Well, I wanted to thank Mayor Goodman and my fellow hotel and casino operators for their support, so I invited the entire city down to have breakfast with us. 
Mr. Mayor, are you prepared to tell america that it's safe to come back to the Montecito? 
The Montecito is not only safe... 
It's delicious. 
How did you get the Mayor? 
Old friend. 
You and Cooper seem to be hitting it off. 
Yeah. 
How much did they take you for? 
- Come on. 
You can tell me. 
- I could, oscar. 
But I won't. 
Insurance cover any of it? 
- Not a dime. 
- Welcome to Las Vegas, Mr. Cooper. 
* you rock it out until the end of time * * you get too tall' cause you know you're fine * 
* tv feels... 
- Sam? 
- Hey. 
Todd beederman. 
Wow, you are beautiful. 
I'll tell you that again tomorrow morning when you wake up next to me. 
Welcome to shooters. 
I know... 
Sounds a lot like shooters. 
For a reason. 
Somebody slurs the word hooters in a cab, half the time, they end up here. 
- Smart. 
- Let me tell you something about shooters, okay? 
It's new, it's hip, it's nonstop. 
You know, I'm sorry. 
I have to be honest with you. 
I'm not exactly sure if my, uh, clientele is gonna be a natural fit for this place. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
Pull over.' Cause I got more high rollers than I know what to do with, okay? 
I got hedge fund guys, I got silicone valley geeks. 
I got trust fund preppies. 
I just need somebody to keep' em all happy, all right? 
And word on the street is you're the best. 
I'm gonna tell ya something else, okay? 
A.J. Cooper called me. 
He told me not to hire you. 
But you know what I am? 
I'm a contrarian. 
Somebody tells me not to touch a hot stove, 
I will burn my hand until it's a hunk of sizzling flesh. 
- That's quite a metaphor. 
- What's a metaphor? 
- Where was I? 
- Contrarian. 
Right, some rich guy is gonna tell me not to do something? 
What do you think I'm gonna do? 
You're gonna do it. 
You're hired! 
Great! 
Boom. 
Todd beederman. 
Remember it. 
You're gonna be screamin' it later. 
When we started talking about an inside job, it got me thinking. 
What if the one person most able to stop this thing was somehow put in the worst possible place? 
- Who? 
- You. 
On the casino floor, sure to get gassed at the very moment this whole thing went down. 
So? 
That was a coincidence. 
Now, did your uncle say something to you to get you to go back inside? 
Yeah. 
He wanted to go back in to buy something for Delinda. 
Did you volunteer to wait for him, or did he ask you to go with him? 
What difference does it make? 
We both went back in. 
Did you know Luke kennedy's unit in the gulf war specialized in weaponized gas attacks? 
Mike, we both got gassed. 
You trying to tell me my uncle Luke had something to do with this? 
I'm just saying he shows up out of nowhere after 25 years. 
He's got the operational experience. 
Tell me you never thought of it, but don't say it doesn't make sense. 
Hey. 
- Where's Luke? 
- He said he was gonna call you. 
- I thought we were all having dinner. 
- He packed a bag and took off. 
Said he didn't know when he was coming back. 
We've been waiting for you to come to us with this. 
Your uncle's been a person of interest since two hours after the robbery. 
Why didn't you say something? 
If you hadn't brought up Luke Kennedy, we'd be looking at you right now, McCoy. 
- Are you kidding me? 
- Mike Cannon too. 
The foxes guarding the chicken coop... 
Wouldn't be the first time. 
Okay, look, all I know is that he packed his bag and he hit the road... 
That's it. 
We've got every cop in the western U.S. looking for him, so it's just a matter of time. 
All right, well... 
I heard you guys were lookin for me... 
What's up? 
Where the hell have you been? 
Well, I went to purge the snorkel, so to speak. 
You went... 
What? 
I went to pahrump. 
To the cathouse. 
Luke Kennedy, you're hereby being held as a person of interest in the gassing ahd robbery of the Montecito resort and casino. 
Is it some kind of joke, Danny? 
* first night that I got out of jail * * lips red and your skin was pale * * you were the one that I wanted to nail * * yeah * 
* I asked you for a table dance * * you came over and put your hand in my pants * 
* I ain't lookin' for no wild romance * * by the way, you got a smoke? 
What are you doing? 
- Need you come home. 
- No, no. 
I-I love it here. 
It's the best. 
I feel like I forgot what it was like to have fun. 
50 gees on think. 
50 gees on grownd. 
Hey, hey guys. 
What you betting on? 
Her nipples. 
Ahh. 
Her nipples. 
Sam, this isn't you. 
- Whev are you talking about it's genius. 
- All you have to do this apologies. 
Oh never! 
Mr. Leeezma I'm A.J. Cooper, the new owner of the Montecito. 
and I'like to personaly invite you for the weekend. 
This weekend, huh? 
Yeah, I don't know. 
Well, I could have the Montecito jet in tucsoin an hour. 
Jet, huh? 
Well, I tell you what, before you go down to the blackjack table, about I send up a pitcher of mojitos and uh, some surf and turf to your suite? 
we... At the hell, Mr. Cooper. 
I'll see you tomorrow afternoon. 
I'm looking forward to it. 
Piece of cake. 
You're not married, are you? 
Please... 
I have a time keeping a boyfriend. 
Always seem to be better at people's relationships than my own. 
You know, most people will tell you that the secret to a happy relationship is compromise. 
Pretty much every won I know says that. 
They're wrong. 
You gotta do what make you happy. 
And then you gotta find at mate. 
who his greatest joy from see' you at way. 
That's pretty profound. 
- I know the Feds want you to hold back on this one. 
- Don't. 
We gotta accomplish two things, Mike. 
Not just catch the guys who did this. 
We gotta recover the bulk of the money. 
You got about week's operating and cash left. 
Maybe I'm not as rich as you think I am. 
What you got, Piper? 
- Basically, sir. 
- Cooper. 
Steve Barrett loved this place so much that he wants to spend eternity here in the Montecito. 
It's the ultimate in brand loyalty. 
No dead people in my hotel. 
Well, there is an historical precedent, not to mention revenue stream. 
It's an all cash offer, $ 1 million. 
- How did he die? 
- Got him by an ice cream truck. 
All licenses and permits already been fast-tracked. 
We get have them within 24 hours. 
- How much do build out the chapel? 
- $ 100,000. 
Okay. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
What are you doing? 
Mr. Leeezma, I'm A.J. Cooper. 
I'm here to welcome you. 
Why'do you open the driver side door? 
The last one someone open uhe driver's side door. 
- When I shod up here, I lost $ 4 million. 
- I'm sorry, sir. 
Where is Sam Marquez? 
She knows. 
Passenger side, front door, I climber the seat. 
- Sam is no longer with us. 
- Yeah, what's your problem, bud. 
Driver's side rear. 
What's the matter with you? 
Henry, get me the hell out of here! 
Let's go! 
u... you want to shoot the door? 
Yeah, thanks. 
Thanks a lot. 
You really think I will come back. 
After all this time and you like this, Danny. 
I really know you, Luke. 
So what'd they do, put a wire on you? 
See if you could get me to confess? 
I wanna know why you brought me back to the casino. 
Cause I wanted to get something nice for Delinda. 
That's all. 
- I don't believe you. 
- Yeah, never done Feds. 
Tell you what? 
This whole thing blows over, they catch the guys who did this, and you come back to me to tell me that you're sorry, don't. 
We just call it even. 
Just show me an arm. 
- What for? 
- Your owner arm. 
Why? 
Pull up you slee and show me your right forearm. 
That's mom. 
Is that what yow want to see, ki? 
Did you sick? 
- For you, sure. 
- Sam wants to apologize. 
Danny. 
Jill, how are you? 
- Oh, good. 
- So they keeping you busy over here? 
- I just go tumped up to homicide. 
- Wow, criminal murder. 
I am four body tonight already in the southwest. 
Probably four more. 
Every tweaker in the valley's crawling the walls. 
All of a sudden body's making meth. 
So where am I going to my meth? 
Heh, anyway, it's nice to see you. 
I gotta run. 
Sam! 
- Thanks. 
- Oh, everytime they say," thar she blows," 
- Everybody does a shot! 
You can't do a shot. 
- You see me drunk. 
Hey hey hey! 
Who is your friend? 
It's Delinda. 
Well, line up some shots somer here. 
I'm pregnant. 
Get her a beer. 
O / ~ wanna plant some sugar kisses o / ~ o / ~ on yo hairy double chin yeah 
o / ~ thar she blows o / ~ 
- Hey. 
- Hey! 
Gonna come home tonight? 
No, I wanna sleep, I think right here on the bar tonight. 
Until my next shift. 
Isn't awesome? 
Yeah! 
It's awesome. 
You hate it, huh? 
Hmm, yes. 
I hate it. 
That's why I'm drinking. 
Cooper wants to apologize. 
Really? 
Yeah. 
Okay. 
I was thinking, since Liz and Steve have been to the Montecito over 5 times, we must be them on surveillance all over the propery. 
Ah, you wanna make greatest hits video for Liz a keepsake? 
- Yeah, I know it's a crazy time for you guys. 
- No, that's a really sweet idea. 
I'll have somebody in surveillance do it. 
- You were such a romantic? 
- Everybody. 
We're all here. 
Okay. 
Well? 
- I've got things to do. 
- This is ridiculous. 
Both of you, sit down. 
Cooper! 
Sit! 
Now, I love this place. 
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let it go under because you're both too stubborn to reach a simple compromise! 
You two better get symbiotic... 
And you better do it quickly. 
Do you bowl? 
No. 
We've got over 50 trysts documented so far. 
No wonder Steve loved the Montecito so much. 
I know. 
Sometimes he got busy with multiple women on the same date. 
Damn, Steve was a pimp. 
Well I didn't know that was physically possible. 
Oh, yeah, you just have to stretch out your hamstrings a little bit. 
Poor Liz. 
You know, what are we gonna do with all this playback? 
What playback? 
Bikers, street gangs, professional thieves. 
None of these guys are sophisticated enough to pull off a caper of this magnitude. 
Yeah, I'm not sure about Luke. 
What, you don't know if he was involved or you don't know if you should have dimed him to the Feds? 
Hey, I just ran into Jill Harris on the way to metro. 
- She still working vice? 
- No, homicide. 
She said something about how there's no meth left in Vegas and now all the tweakers are killing each other. 
- No meth? 
- Yeah. 
What, are they making something else? 
Fentanyl? 
You remember that white dude, tall guy, with the zz top beard. 
Used to come in spreading money around? 
Uh, Wayne Squirek. 
He was one of the biggest meth camels. 
That's it. 
- Are you getting enough calcium? 
- Yeah. 
You sure? 
Honest, I'm fine. 
'Cause you really need to take those tums things. 
I mean, whether your tummy hurts or not. 
You know, Delinda, my life, it might be 20 miles of bad road, but you, Danny... 
And that beautiful baby you got inside of you, you're the only family that I got. 
Just look me in the eye and tell me you didn't do it. 
I had nothing to do with any of this. 
I know he loves you, uncle Luke, but... 
Nobody knows more than me that it'll take time. 
I got plenty of that, right? 
The customer confidence surveys are not tracking it the way we hoped. 
I'm not paying you to take polls, I'm paying you to change minds. 
Ah, hear me out. 
This is important. 
We ask past Montecito customers about their intent to return. 
General consensus was, they wanted the people who did this to be caught before they came back. 
Surveys don't measure logic, they measure feelings. 
So how do we change those feelings? 
You've got the reputation as a loyal guy. 
To a fault sometimes, as I understand. 
You gotta make a clean break from this event. 
Get to the point, Ted. 
Fire Danny McCoy and Mike Cannon. 
Put this whole thing behind you. 
- You hear that? 
- What? 
Listen. 
- Run. 
- Go go go go! 
Maybe you can tell us why Wayne Squirek was already dead before the trailer exploded. 
- We thought... 
- You thought. 
You thought what? 
That today moses was gonna come down from the mountain top, turn you into police? 
Outside of that casino of yours, you're not even licensed to help an old lady across the street! 
Hey, get these two behind the yellow tape. 
And if they as much as look back over their shoulders lock their asses up for obstruction. 
See how she was looking at me? 
It's called angry love, Danny. 
Hey. 
Look at this. 
This must have blown clear over here from the trailer. 
Oranges. 
You were right. 
It's a local crew, for sure. 
Still can't figure how your uncle fits into all this. 
I like the tattoo. 
Did you design that yourself? 
Nah, had it since I was probie. 
Almost all of us got' em. 
I know, but I'm telling you Casey had the means, and he had the access. 
- What about motive? 
- 31 million bucks? 
- You need to be sure about this. 
- I am sure. 
I heard there's a suspect. 
- Possibly. 
- Fabulous job. 
Just great, really. 
We're looking at the fire captain... 
Bob Casey and his men. 
Potential red flag there. 
We have to be very careful taking down a firefighter. 
Post-911, they're untouchable. 
- I would recommend keeping our fingerprints... 
- Ted, you're fired. 
Go get' em. 
What are you doing here? 
The Feds have nothing on me, so they cut me loose. 
Where you goin'? 
Bob Casey and his men were the ones that pulled off the heist. 
- You're kidding me. 
- No, I'm not. 
That makes sense, though. 
Look... 
I just want to apologize. 
What'd I tell you before? 
I have to go. 
I'm going with you. 
- The hell you're coming with me. 
- Hey, look, I know Bob Casey from the old days. 
Believe me, you do not want to do this alone. 
This place looks great. 
We've had a dozen other inquiries already. 
This is gonna be huge. 
Look it, look it, look it. 
What is this? 
Steve would want this to be brief. 
So I've only got a few words to say. 
Steve loved you all, and he loved the Montecito. 
And why not? 
He got laid in practically every room in this hotel. 
Didn't see that one comin'. 
Farewell, sweet prince. 
At least I know where you'll be sleeping tonight. 
Uh, Mrs. Barrett will be receiving visitors at the Montecito buffet on the lobby level. 
You know how to bowl, don't you? 
No, no. 
That's just a little beginner's luck. 
You won this fair and square. 
No, I want you to have it. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. 
I'll bet you $ 10, 000 you can't throw another strike. 
You just crossed the line. 
Ah, here we go. 
You didn't mean that apology, did you? 
- You just brought me up here to humiliate me. 
- No, I didn't. 
Your foot... crossed over the line. 
It's a foul. 
In the spirit of detente, we'll count the strike. 
But I might have to owe you the $ 10, 000. 
Danny boy. 
Luke Kennedy. 
You haven been here since you were a little kid. 
- I don't remember that. 
- Yeah? Well, I do. 
While you were doing Cannonballs in my pool, your old man was giving me $ 2, 000 to forge the fire inspection papers on a condo project over on Maryland. 
What are you talking about? 
It was the wild west back then. 
Almost everybody was into something. 
Is that true? 
Tell him, Luke. 
Is that true? 
Where's the money, Bob? 
Okay. 
I got $ 3 million. 
Right here. 
You two are welcome to it. 
The rest is back at the firehouse, but that's for my guys. 
Take it easy, son. 
We're just talking, right? 
Let me get you fellas a couple of beers 
- while we figure this out. 
- There's nothing else to talk... 
Danny! 
Get an ambulance in here! 
We got two down at the location. 
- Get an ambulance here now! 
- Hey, look at me. 
You stupid son of a bitch, what were you thinking? 
Hang in there. 
Come on. 
Come on, hang in there. 
What do you say, kid... 
Are we even? 
All those kids and their hipping and their hopping. 
Pull up your damned pants, you morons! 
Second Comedy Central special, it's gonna be great! 
I don't want to wear the pink bow. 
He even does this in his sleep. 
What a freak! 
Would you idiots give it a rest? 
Would you like to see my stick? 
Thank you! 
Thank you. 
Thank you so much. 
You can't fool me. 
I know it's all for the little guys in the suitcase. 
Thank you for coming out tonight. This is such a pleasure. 
Before we start, I must say it is a true honor to be in this theater with you people, in the capital of the greatest country in the world the United States of America. 
In driving around the city the last couple of days - 
I couldn't help but realize that here in D.C., like everywhere else gas prices suck! 
My wife and I live in L.A., and we were owners of 2 big SUVs. 
We decided to do the economically and ecologically right thing. 
We got rid of one of the big, giant SUVs and got a Prius. 
I don't know why you're laughing, it's a great vehicle. 
You jump on the freeway and punch it, it goes : 
When you can drive underneath an 18 - wheeler and go : That's really dirty, and drive back out... 
That is just too damned small. 
It's cool at the gas pump. 
On one tank you've driven 2 or 3000 miles. You fill up and go : 
Oh, all done! 
I'll be damned. 
That's amazing! 
The one vehicle I refuse to get rid of, I've had it for 10 years. 
I love this thing. I've taken good care of it. 
It's not politically correct to drive it. I don't care. 
H-1 Hummer. The real one, the big one, the military version. 
I love this thing. It has a 38 gallon tank. 
Gets 7 miles to the gallon. 
Diesel, where I live, at its peak was $ 3.84 per gallon. 
I went to fill it up that week, it wasn't even empty. It cost me a hundred forty - eight dollars. 
I pushed the vehicle home. 
As I rolled it into the driveway, I told my kids : 
Girls, look at our new front yard ornament. 
Get in the Prius. 
You suck, Dad! 
I used to pick Priuses out of the grill of my Hummer. 
During the holidays last year, we took the Hummer in for maintenance. 
Then we were driving home and my wife is behind me in the Hummer. 
I'm in front driving the Prius. 
I was tricked somehow. I don't know how that happened. 
She calls me on the cell phone, laughing. Let me explain why. 
Our Prius is not a black Prius. 
It's not a red Prius, it's a blue Prius. 
But not really blue. It's more of a... blue... 
It's pretty. 
Sparkly! 
I did that a little too well, didn't I? 
While I'm driving, I'm holding in my arm, my wife's 3 - pound Chihuahua. 
You have to hold it while you drive or it'll fall down between the seats. 
Where the hell is this dog? 
Oh, there you are! 
Let me put down the parking brake, that'll hold you, you bastard. 
I've got to shift... 
That was your head? I'm sorry. 
I thought it was the shifty thingy. 
Leather, fur, I don't know the difference. 
I thought I was grinding the gears. 
Thanks for laughing at that. 
That's the stupidest joke I tell all night. 
That morning, I don't know why I didn't see it my children had taken vinyl window holiday decorations and put them all over the back window of the Prius. 
Christmas trees, Santa Claus. 
Snowflakes. It was so pretty. 
My wife calls me, laughing hysterically. 
What's so funny? 
You're driving a powder blue Prius, holding a 3 - pound Chihuahua. 
There's pretty Christmas decorations all over your car. 
And you make a living with dolls. 
And I'm like, Bitch! 
That's my wife's idea of a family pet. 
The dog I picked out is Bill, our Golden Retriever. 
He's 80 pounds. 
Now that is a dog, ladies and gentlemen. 
I named him Bill because I got him when Clinton was in office and as a puppy, he was humping everything. 
When it comes to dogs - 
- I have criteria for what is and is not a dog. 
Here is what is not a dog : 
anything that bounces when it barks. 
Not a dog : anything I can easily drop - kick over my back fence. 
Not a dog : anything that is regularly terrified by a running leaf. 
That's not a dog, that's a yapping Beanie Baby, that's what that is. 
It's the Richard Simmons of canines, that's all I'm saying. 
Honey, what was that? I don't know! , 
Bill's sitting next to me : I don't know either! 
You're a genius, do it again! 
Size does matter in the canine brain. 
Bill, Golden Retriever, very smart animal. 
If he pooped on the living room carpet, I stuck his nose in it. 
Three times later, he figured out : 
I'm not supposed to crap here. 
Next two dogs, same thing. 
Now the brain - dead Chihuahua comes along. 
She poops on the carpet, I stick her nose in it three times later she thinks, I'm not supposed to crap, ever. 
And that's why they shake. 
Another way Chihuahuas prove their lack of intelligence : 
Most dogs know when you find a stick in the yard and you run with it you put the stick in your mouth sideways. 
I am not kidding. 
This little idiot dog found a stick as long as she was and she stuck it in her mouth straight out the front. 
This is all true. 
We're on the couch watching TV. 
She runs through the house, as fast as she can, stick straight out. 
As she runs across the carpet she decides to quickly look down. 
Stick in the carpet, crammed down her throat. 
With momentum, she actually pole - vaulted over the stick. 
Of course my wife and my girls are all... 
I couldn't breathe, I was laughing so hard. 
I thought, Damn, if she'd been going a little faster - 
- I'd have a new puppet. A Chihuahua on a stick! 
My wife started going nuts with the Chihuahua thing. 
She named her Chihuahua Darby. 
After a year and a half my wife decided it was time to breed the dog. 
My wife got on the internet and found the 3 - pound... stud... 
I don't know how you call anything that's 3 pounds' a stud'. 
We picked up little Jake. The owner wanted to get rid of him. 
So Jake came to live at our house. 
He was full grown, ready to go. Then Darby came in heat. 
Not long after that we had three tiny little Chihuahua puppies. 
The two larger ones my wife gave away. 
The runt of the litter... The runt from two 3 - pound dogs we decided to keep. 
Rusty is now full - grown, at a whopping 1.8 pounds. 
The cool part is he and 80 - pound Bill are best friends. 
I don't know how you can be best friends with someone who is the same size as your poop. 
My kids question whether I'm funny or not. 
I pointed that out in the backyard to them. 
I'm a comedy genius now! 
The cool part is little Rusty picked me over everyone else to bond with. 
He likes me best, we don't know why. I kinda like it. 
I come home, he runs to the front door, I pick him up take him to my office. 
I have a stuffed car, he sits in that car. 
If he sits just right, it looks like he's driving around my desk. 
People walk in my office, It's a rat! 
The bond between Rusty and me has gone beyond just companionship. 
There's an emotional bond. 
This has happened 5 times. It can't be coincidence. 
The three Chihuahuas sleep in the bed with my wife and me. 
My wife and I will get into an argument, go to bed angry. 
You're not supposed to do that, but we're tired. 
Rusty hears the argument, knows we're not happy with each other. 
But he takes my side. At 3 or 4 in the morning he will wake up, and pee on my wife. 
I am not kidding. 
It's the greatest thing ever! 
I have the satisfaction of knowing if I go to bed angry with my wife, it's gonna be taken care of. 
This is all absolutely true. 
I had to get up early for an East Coast flight, about 3 : 30. 
My wife and I had argued, I wake up still mad at her. 
4 am, I'm ready to walk out the door, but I still love her. 
I go to kiss her. I walk over and put my hand on her... 
Rusty, my man! 
It's still warm, she hasn't woken up yet. 
I lean over, I love you honey, see you later, Rusty pissed on you. Bye! 
Rusty's at the end of the bed just wagging his tail. 
I'm at the front door, I hope he doesn't teach Bill to do that. 
We have three daughters. They are 9, 11 and 15 years old. 
They've had normal childhoods. 
Most things have been great. Some things have been different because of the ventriloquism. 
For example, their Barbie dolls actually speak. 
Not when Mommy's around. 
Ken, you smell like beer and cigarettes. 
I'm a lot of fun at Toys' R' Us around Christmastime. 
Boys run to their parents, Mommy, know what that G.I Joe said to me? 
They will never catch me. 
We try to take family walks as often as possible. 
On these walks, we let one kid pick out one dog. 
One evening we let Kenna, the 9 - year - old, choose. 
Kenna seems to have a real twisted sense of humor. 
We don't know where that came from. 
We have a leash. One of those big self - retracting leashes. 
You push the button and it quickly retracts. 
Don't beat me to the funny part. 
I walk out the front door and think I'll be the first one there. Kenna is out front and has Darby hooked up to that leash. 
She's 2 feet away. 
Kenna keeps pushing the button and letting it up. Darby is going... 
I ask Kenna, What are you doing? 
I'm trying to make her heel automatically. 
I say, Kenna! It doesn't work. 
I already tried it. 
High five. 
We're out for a walk and Kenna has the dog at full extension. 
30 or 40 feet on the leash and she hasn't given up on what she's trying. 
As we're walking she's pushing the button and letting it up. 
Looking at the dog, looking at the leash the wheels in her head turning... 
What is this twisted little child going to do? 
As we're walking, she pushed the button. Quickly and on purpose dropped the leash. 
Do you see the brilliance here? 
The leash then began to chase the Chihuahua. 
A big hunk of black plastic skimmed across the pavement. 
The Chihuahua stopped. She heard a new noise. 
She looked behind her. Here comes the leash. 
At this point, the Chihuahua is smart enough to know that now would be a good time to panic. 
She took off like a bullet down the street running as fast as she could. 
But the leash was slightly faster. 
I'm standing there, Where's the video camera? 
We can win 10,000 bucks! 
Of course my wife and my two oldest girls... 
Kenna and I are rolling in the lawn. 
I'm high-fiving her, telling her she's a genius. 
Mommy turns around, sees us laughing. 
Crap! Don't look her in the eye. Look down. 
Rusty will piss on her later. 
Ladies and gentlemen, you're an awesome audience. 
How about we get to the people you came to see tonight? 
The first guy, I think audiences enjoy because everyone knows someone like this. 
In your own family or where you work. 
Please help me welcome my old friend, Walter. 
Get a life. 
- How you doing, Walter? 
- What happened to your hair? 
Looks like you were in a fricking car wreck. 
- They said it makes me look hip. 
- I think it makes you look homeless. 
Been in D.C. for two days and you're already fricking homeless. 
Holy cow. 
- Come on, Walter, do you like D.C.? 
- Oh yeah. 
There's nothing quite like being mugged in our nation's capital. 
There's a lot of excitement that goes on in Washington, D.C. 
Yeah, what happens in D.C. stays on YouTube. 
So you don't like being in D.C.? 
No, I like it. 
I get screwed on my taxes every year. So it's fun to come visit the source. 
- What did you do for fun today? 
- Stood in front of the IRS building. I just flipped them off. 
- Did you go to the White House? - Oh yeah. 
That's where the most powerful man in the free world lives. 
Oprah? 
- What's wrong with you tonight? 
- I don't know. 
- I don't want to go home. 
- Why not? 
I think my house is haunted. 
- Why do you think that? 
I walk in the front door and all I hear is, Get out! 
You got in another argument on the phone today, didn't you? 
- You heard that, did you? 
- Oh yeah. Hung up on her. 
She called right back, Did you hang up on me? 
I said, I don't know, did it sound something like this? 
- Did that make her angry? 
- I felt a disturbance in The Force. 
You ever made her that mad when you're standing in front of her? 
My mother told me if you're in a jam and don't know what to do you should think, What would Jesus do? Yeah. 
So I tried to turn her into a fish. 
I stood there going, Begone, Satan! 
Hello, Shamu! 
Well, at least Shamu has only one blowhole. 
Aw, screw you. That was funny. 
Look, it's the CIA. 
I see you. 
We can all see you. 
You know, the show looks a lot better from the front. 
Is the director drunk? What the hell? 
Holy crap! 
Wait, come back. Let me see in there. 
This is Comedy Central. 
I can see Kenny. 
Oh, he just got killed. 
You've been married a long time. 
Ups and downs in any marriage. 
Ever been to marriage counseling? 
- Yes. - What did that do for you? 
Look at me. 
I'm happy! Come on. 
What were the results of the counseling? 
At the end of it all, there were two folks who thought I was an ass. 
And I'm paying both of them. 
- But you are happy to be here? - Oh sure. 
Better than last week. 
Last week? 
Fort Lauderdale, Florida. You didn't like that? No. 
Everyone in Fort Lauderdale, Florida looks exactly like me. 
I swear, it's like one giant nursing home. 
Ft. Lauderdale is where they tape those Girls Gone Wild videos. 
That's during Spring Break. 
The rest of the time it's Girls Gone Saggy. 
Or it's Girls Gone Senile. 
And then it's just Girls Gone. 
- You didn't like the weather either. - Oh my God. 
Even in the middle of winter, it's humid as hell and hot as hell. 
We got there, I took a shower on Monday. 
Friday, still not dry. 
I swear, I have moss on my ass. 
You said the weather changes too quickly. 
I know it changes fast everywhere, but in Florida, it's ridiculous. 
- What are you talking about? 
- I was standing on the beach. In the sunshine, having a little iced tea. 
I looked over and go, Ooh, look, a little cloud. 
About three minutes later... 
Holy crap! 
The locals are hanging on to the palm trees. 
You dumbasses! 
I say, leave it to the Cubans and get the hell out! 
Alright, so you want someplace a little cooler. 
Remember, we went to Green Bay, Wisconsin. 
Yeah, in February! 
It was negative 20 with a negative 30 wind chill. 
I'd get on stage every night and say, You people are idiots. 
Did you know the borders are open? 
Pack up your Suburban and get the hell out! 
Another thing. 
Green Bay Packers stadium, what's it called? 
- Lambo Field. 
- Lambo Field. 
No roof. Hello! 
How many football season weekends have good weather in Green Bay? 
That would be... none. 
Note to self : build a fricking roof. 
We have the technology. 
Yeah, you talk to the locals in Green Bay, what do they say? 
We love it here. 
We're a hardy people. 
A bunch of frozen dumbasses, is what you are. 
Walter, you don't like humidity, you don't like extreme cold. 
You want someplace warmer and drier. 
- Well in August, we were in Phoenix. 
- August in Phoenix, Arizona. 
Your agent is a moron. 
It was 112 for three days in a row. 
What do all the locals say? 
But it's a dry heat. 
Screw you. 
A bonfire's a dry heat. 
You don't see me sticking my ass in one of those, do you? 
Your ass is on fire. It's a dry heat! 
I was in Florida, I gotta burn off the fricking moss! 
- Did you enjoy New York City? 
- Oh, I love New York City. 
It was great. 
Do shows in Manhattan, about midnight get back to the hotel. 
At 1 a.m., I'd lay my head on the pillow and listen to the sounds of the city. 
Oh my God. 
- The city that never sleeps. 
- Well, it needs a fricking nap. 
You've eliminated every corner of the country. What about where we live? 
People love the weather in Southern California. 
At least with Florida and hurricanes, you get a little notice. 
You turn on the news : 
You have three days to get the hell out! 
- In L.A., we've got earthquakes. 
One morning, you could be sitting on the toilet and all of a sudden... 
There's crap flying around the house. 
We love it here! 
You're a dumbass, too. 
- Remember that last big earthquake? 
- Sure. 
- Bad timing on that earthquake. - How's that? 
Not two seconds before it hit, I told my grandson to pull my finger. 
He pulled it, I farted and half the neighborhood fell down. 
That kid hasn't come near me since. 
The other day I cracked my knuckles and he dove under the couch. 
- What was that? 
- We're in D.C. That was a veto. 
Walter, I'm listening to you and I get the feeling we travel too much. 
Oh, you think? 
- Why don't you like airplanes? 
- I'm your carryon, for God's sakes. 
I go in the x - ray machine. 
I could have cancer tonight! 
- Tell them what happened at O'Hare. 
- We're going through the airport. I come out the other side of the x - ray and hear the guy say to Jeff : 
Sir! 
I've got to look inside your suitcase. 
I'm lying there thinking, Aw crap, here we go. 
Jeff's standing there, the guy opens the case, I pop up and go : 
Hey! 
Scared the crap out of the guy. 
Then I thought about it a second and said : 
I do not want to go to Los Angeles. 
- And what happened? 
- We were detained. 
Them bastards have no sense of humor. 
They have to be tight on security these days. I know. 
The terrorist threats and all that crap. 
There's one group of folks I don't understand at all. 
Damned suicide bombers. 
Good God, what the hell is this? 
Well, way to go, habib. 
Bet you can't fricking do it again. 
Dumbass. 
Walter, those guys believe that if they martyr themselves there will be 72 virgins waiting for them in Paradise. 
Well, April Fool, dumbass! 
If there are virgins waiting for you, it'll be 72 guys just like you! 
Oh no, this is not what Osama said it would be. 
72 virgins? 
Why not 72 slutty broads who know what they're doing? 
He had a longer fuse. 
I wonder if they pull that joke on each other every once in a while. 
What joke? 
What the... 
Did you see Jamil's face? 
It's gone now, but did you see his face? 
72 virgins. 
Sounds like a punishment to me. 
I gotta teach 72 women how to have sex? 
Oh my God! 
I hope there's no Viagra in heaven. 
Impotence is God's way of helping a man like me to' just say no'. 
If I take Viagra, it's just to help me keep from rolling out of bed. 
- Did you get that one? 
- She got it! 
- It's a kickstand joke. 
- Will you stop? 
What're you shaking your head at? 
You got a good love life? 
- Sure. Yeah. 
- Good sex life? 
With your wife? 
- Good for her, too? 
- Yeah. 
- How do you know? 
- What? 
- How do you know? 
We're waiting! 
Well, sometimes she calls me The Hurricane. 
- The what? - The Hurricane. 
Yeah, I get it. 
Exciting at first, then it ends in disaster. 
You know, maybe she should call you FEMA. 
Now what does that mean? 
Slow to respond and not a lot of satisfying results. 
You should know. How long have you been married? 
- 47 years. - That's amazing. 
I know it. 
That old bitch will never die. 
- How long you been married? 
- 17 years. 
That's pretty good. How do you do it? 
I learned a long time ago that every couple argues. 
I learned that when we're in the middle of a big argument - 
- I just think of something completely different. 
That takes my mind off it, and I don't stay angry as long. 
So you think of something completely different? 
Like what? 
Oh I don't know. Like if you choke a Smurf, what color does it turn? 
- Choke a Smurf? - Right. 
Is that what they're calling it now? 
What the hell happened to the chicken? 
Let me get back to marriage. You've been married a long time. 
- Do you still really love your wife? 
- Of course I love her. 
- Told her lately that you love her? 
- Why not? - She knows it. 
- How does she know it? 
- I smile a lot. 
- Have you ever cheated on her? - No! 
Dammit. 
- Marriage is supposed to be forever. 
- And this one's taking too damn long. 
- Marriage is an institution. 
- So is Alcatraz. 
You can't compare marriage to prison. I guess you're right. 
The warden doesn't max out your credit cards. 
The other day she got me some of that spray - on hair crap in a can. 
- Did you use it? 
- Yeah. 
Turned it into a Shi - Tzu. 
Your birthday wasn't too long ago. Did your wife get you anything? 
- She got me a book on reincarnation. 
- Do you believe in reincarnation? 
- Hell, I don't know. 
- Who would you come back as? 
I'd come back as my wife and leave me the hell alone. 
- You pick on her all the time. 
- Yeah, I know. 
Maybe one day, I'll be reincarnated and come back as a sensitive guy. 
Driving a blue fricking Prius. 
- That is the saddest little vehicle. 
- It's a great car! 
You ever heard it when you're driving by? 
It goes, IIIII'm gay. 
IIIII'm gay. 
When it idles it goes homohomohomohomo... 
- Is that a new watch? 
- No, I've had it a long time. 
A long time ago you had a rubber, plastic ugly funny name thing. 
That was years ago when I was in college. 
They were popular and might be coming back. 
It's called a Swatch. 
What in the hell is a Swatch? 
A company in Switzerland invented that watch, so they called it Swatch. 
Good thing they weren't in Croatia. 
What time is it? , I don't know, let me look at my Crotch. 
Sorry I'm late, but my Crotch is a little slow. 
- It's like the Timex, it takes a... 
- Walter! 
That's Walter, there we go! 
Thank you. 
As we all know, there's a big mess in the Middle East right now. 
When it comes to the terrorists most of us don't understand their extremist views and beliefs. 
I was thinking, how would it be to sit and talk to one of those guys? 
We have that opportunity tonight. 
Please help me welcome - - Achmed, the Dead Terrorist. 
- Good evening, Achmed. 
- Good evening. 
Infidel. 
- So you're a terrorist. - Yes. 
I am a terrorist. 
- What kind of terrorist? 
- A terrifying... terrorist. 
- Are you scared? 
- Not really. No. - And now? 
- Not really. 
No. 
- How about now? - No. 
Goddammit. 
I mean... uh... I mean, Allahdammit. 
Silence! 
I kill you. 
- So, Achmed. 
- No, no. Is Achmed. 
- That's what I said. 
- No, you said Achmed. 
Is Achmed. 
Silence! 
I kill you. 
- How do you spell it? 
- How do you spell your name? 
- Oh let's see. A. C... 
Phlegm. 
Silence! 
I kill you. 
As a terrorist, I suppose you have some sort of specialty. 
Yes. 
I am a suicide bomber. 
- So, you're finished. 
- You've done your job. 
- No, I haven't. 
- You're dead. 
- No, I'm not. 
I feel fine. 
- But you're all bone. 
- Is a flesh wound. 
Silence! 
I kill you. 
What the hell happened to my feet? 
Son of a bitch. 
What the hell? 
What are you trying to... 
Stop touching me! 
I kill you! 
- We'll fix this. 
- What are you doing? 
Holy crap! 
I'm in the air, wait wait. 
Something is backwards. 
I need some ligaments. 
- Just sit still. - Okay. 
I will not move my ass. 
You idiot, you don't have an ass! 
- Is that Walter? - Yeah. 
He scares the crap out of me. 
Please, do not put me back in the same suitcase. 
- Why? 
- He has gas! 
Saddam's mustard gas was nothing compared to a Walter fart. 
It's not funny. 
He will kill us. 
Listen, I have something to tell you. 
- What? 
- You really are dead. 
Are you sure? 
I just got my flu shot. 
- You really are dead. 
- Wait, if I'm dead... 
That means I get my 72 virgins. 
Are you my virgins? 
- I hope not. - Why? 
There's a bunch of ugly - ass guys out there. 
If this is Paradise, I've been screwed! 
Did they say it would be only female virgins? 
Holy crap! 
Wait! I can have Clay Aiken. 
I told a joke. 
- Achmed, where did you come from? 
- Your fricking suitcase. 
I told another one. 
If you've been in my suitcase how have we been getting through airport security? 
That's easy. 
They open the case and I go, Hello! 
I told another joke! 
I can do this crap too. 
Here's another one. 
Two Jews walk in a bar... 
- No. 
No. 
- What? 
You don't let Jews in your bar? 
You racist bastard. 
What I mean is, I don't want racist jokes in my act. 
Okay. How about if I kill the Jews? 
I'm kidding. 
I would not kill the Jews. 
I would toss a penny between them and watch them fight to the death. 
Yes, yes. 
I did the same thing with two Catholic priests and a small boy. 
Yes, yes. And the winner had to fight Michael Jackson! 
Achmed, stop doing this! 
- You can't tell jokes like that. 
- Why not? I'm killing, so to speak. 
You can't tell jokes like that. 
It offends people. 
I'm dead, what do I care? 
What do you want me to do, knock - knock jokes? 
- It would be better. 
- Okay, knock - knock. 
- Who's there? 
As a suicide bomber, did you have training? 
Of course. 
We had the suicide bomber training camp. 
- Is that a nice facility? 
- It used to be. 
- What happened? 
The idiot tried to practice. 
- What did you guys learn from that? 
Do you have a motto, like... 
We're looking for a few good men. 
We're looking for some idiots with no future. 
- Where do you get your recruits? 
That was dark, was it not? 
What exactly happened to you? 
What happened? 
If you must know, I am a horrible suicide bomber. 
- What happened? 
- I had a premature detonation. 
I set the timer for 30 minutes, but it went off in 4 seconds. 
You know what that's like, right? 
Mr. Hurricane. 
Achmed, what exactly happened to you? 
I was getting gasoline and I answered my cell phone. 
Can you hear me n...? 
At first, I thought it was because I went over my minutes. 
It's okay, I took that Verizon bastard with me. 
What's it like to die? 
Do you see a white light? 
If you're dumb enough to watch the explosion, yes. 
Some people say when they die they see a white light. 
What did you see? 
I saw flying car parts... 
What was the last thing through your mind? 
My ass. 
Walter told me to tell that joke. 
- You never saw a white light? 
- No, but I saw a blue Prius. 
Do you really have one of those vehicles? 
That is not a car. 
Did you know, when you're going down the highway in a Prius - If you put your hand out the window, the vehicle will turn? 
- You did this for a bunch of virgins? - Are you kidding me? 
I'd kill you for a Klondike bar. 
- So, I guess you are Muslim? 
- I don't think so, no. 
Look at my ass. 
Made in China. 
Walter says I'm just a stinking Halloween decoration. 
- Do you like being in D.C.? 
- I think some idiots must live here. 
- The Washington Monument. 
- Yes? 
- It looks nothing like the guy. 
It looks more like a tribute to Bill Clinton. 
- What do you think of Bush? 
- Oh, I love bush. 
Oh, you mean the President. 
That's Achmed, the Dead Terrorist! 
Thank you. 
There's never been a better time than right now to introduce a brand new superhero. 
We have that very thing this evening. 
Please help me welcome the superhero... 
H... h... Hi! 
- Good to see you, Melvin. 
- Thank you. It's nice being here in our nation's capital. 
So, you're a superhero. 
What is your most outstanding feature? 
My costume. 
- It's a very nice costume. - Thank you. 
- What does the' D' stand for? 
- Oh, that's my theme song. 
- What's your theme song? 
- Where did you get the costume? 
- That is a superhero secret! 
- EBay? 
- Dammit! 
- How did you deduce that? 
- A tag on the back says EBay. 
It's as plain as the nose... 
Okay, so you're a superhero. 
Do you fight crime? 
- Yes, of course! 
- What kind of crime? 
Bad kind. 
- So what have you done lately? 
- Today, I was battling a terrorist. 
- Achmed? 
- Yes. 
- And what kind of battle? 
Every time I'd get a king, he'd blow it up. 
- So what did you do? 
- I issued a verbal threat. And then Walter gassed him. 
- Melvin, do you have any powers? 
- Yes! 
- Like what? 
- I can fly. 
Really far. 
- How far? 
- How far can you throw me? 
- Do you have other powers? 
- X - ray vision! 
Can you see through something practical, like clothes? 
Oh, you're sick. 
Yes. 
I love looking at boobies. 
That's a beautiful pair, isn't it? 
I'm glad I'm wearing loose shorts. 
Oh, I forgot. 
What? They're good. Those are super - hooters. 
If she had a theme song, it would be Ta ta - ta taa! 
If she had a costume, she'd have two Ds on her chest. 
- I can look but I can't touch. 
- Why? 
I'm lactose intolerant. 
You can fly and have x - ray vision. 
Those are the same as Superman! 
- Can you stop a speeding bullet? 
Shut up! 
It hurts like hell. 
Can you leap tall buildings in a single bound? 
Why the hell would I do that? 
There's not a lot of call for that. 
- Superman does that. 
I can't curse. 
think the President should. 
- The President? - Yeah. 
Think about it. 
We had the A - bomb, the H - bomb. 
It's time for him to drop the F - bomb. 
He could go, Hey, terrorists! 
So, like Superman, do you change clothes in a phone booth? 
What? 
- Superman does that too. 
- He's got issues, doesn't he? 
My wife met Lois Lane once. 
She said she acted like an H 
You mean a W - H - O 
- E. 
Is that like a Klingon? 
So you're married. 
Does your wife have any powers? 
- Like what? 
Once a month... 
She becomes evil. 
And I cannot defeat her. 
Our children run in terror. Our big dog cowers under the couch. 
- You have a big dog? 
- Actually, I borrowed your Chihuahua. 
Superman has a dog, Krypto. 
He has all the same powers as Superman. 
That's ridiculous. 
If Krypto sniffs your crotch he'll suck your lungs out your ass. 
- Do you have an arch enemy? 
- Do you have a weakness? 
And porn. 
What? Not at the same time. 
I need a free hand. 
So, when there's a problem, how are you summoned? 
I'm making a deal with the Commissioner to light up the sky with a spotlight of my symbol. 
- What's your symbol? 
- A big nose in the sky. 
Trouble is, sometimes it doesn't exactly look like a nose. 
It's not a cupcake, either. 
Are you friends with other superheroes? 
- How about Aquaman? 
I like Aquaman, he can breathe underwater and talk to fish. 
Yeah, great. 
He has all the same powers as Sponge Bob. 
- How about the Hulk? 
- Why do you like the Hulk? 
The angrier he gets, the stronger he gets. 
Yeah, like every white trash guy on Cops. 
- I like the Flash. 
- He has no powers! 
He's on Meth. 
- I used to date Cat Woman. 
She gave me something I had to take medicine to get rid of. 
And boy, does it itch. 
And now it burns when I fly. 
Son of a bitch! 
It's the terrorists, I tell you. 
I look like Lex Luthor. 
- Can you put it back? 
- Sure. Here we go. 
- How's that? 
That kinda sucked. 
- Do superheroes date each other? 
- We date mortals sometimes, too. 
Did you know that Superman was dating Rosie O'Donnell? 
- I did not know that. - He had to quit. 
Because she got too big. 
He took her on one flight and threw out his back. 
Embarrassing when you're flying a girl around Metropolis and your feet are still dragging the sidewalk. 
This looks like a job for Slim - Fast! 
- One last guy, how about Batman? 
- Oh. 
A grown man in a rubber suit, running around with a young boy? 
I don't have to have x - ray vision to see what the hell's going on there. 
You have five men in a suitcase. 
And one of them's on a stick. 
Who is sliding down the proverbial Bat pole now? 
If you had a theme song, it would be La la - la laa. 
- You know, I have a wife and kids. 
And that's Melvin the Superhero. There we go. 
Thank you so much. 
If you've seen my show before, you'll recognize this next guy. 
Please help me welcome my buddy, Peanut. 
- How you doing, Peanut? 
- Pretty good, how are you? 
- I'm fine. 
- That's good, that's gooooooood. 
- So, you like it here? 
- Oh, I love being in D.C. 
And I love this theater, the Warner Theater. 
It's fantastic. 
And they've got a cool website. 
- The thing that... 
What? 
The hell is wrong with you? 
We cannot talk at the same time! 
I talk, you talk. 
I talk, you talk, that's it! 
Focus. 
I am so sick of this crap. 
- I have tried going solo. 
- What happened? 
I kept falling off this fricking thing. 
Why did you interrupt me? 
- You mispronounced my last name. 
- I know. - It's Dunham. 
- Not when you look at it. Dun - Ham. 
Haaaaaam. 
You're the other white meat. 
Don't confuse everyone. 
It's Dunham. 
It says Dun - ham ham ham ham. 
Jeff Dun Ham. 
Dot Com. 
Jeff Dun Ham. 
Dot Com. 
And when you think about it for 30 seconds, it's Jefa Fa Dun Ham. 
Dot Com. 
Jefa Fa. 
You're using an unneeded' F'. 
Jefa Fa. 
Dun Ham. 
Dot Com. 
Am I pissing you ofa fa? 
Jefa Fa? 
Dun Ham. 
Dot Com. 
The weird part is, I am actually pissing him off. 
And he would like to kill me. 
But he will not because that would be a form of suicide. 
- You want to kill me. 
- No, I don't. 
Yes, yes, yes. 
Search your feelings, Jefa Fa. 
Dun Ham. 
Dot Com. 
- What? 
- Dude, you need a Tic 
You know what your breath smells like? 
Done ham. 
Dot Com. 
What the hell was that? 
- What? 
- What did you just do? 
- I didn't do anything. 
- You picked your nose. 
Did you see that? 
- Oh my God. 
You fricking picked... your nose! 
- What? 
- You didn't do a very good job! 
- There's still something there. 
- Cut it out! 
- You gotta get it. 
It's wiggling. 
- Stop it! 
Oh wait! 
You're a ventriloquist. 
That'd be funny as hell! 
Only give it a French accent. 
Bonjour! 
I would like to come out of your nose! 
Stop it. 
Holy crap, you're quick. 
It's like you know. 
You do that now, you just go... 
- That's always been your thing. 
- You do it. 
Short one, long one. 
Do it! 
Do it. 
What the hell was that? 
You sound like some anemic French guy. 
German : jawohl! 
Chinese : 
Gay guy : 
Wait, wait. A guy driving a blue Prius : 
You know what would be funny as hell? 
When this gets on Comedy Central, if the show is sponsored by Toyota. 
And they have no idea. 
One night they're watching this like, Hey! 
He making fun of our cars! 
He say our car is gay. 
It not gay, he gay. 
Let's get Godzilla to kill him. 
- It's a tiny little car, isn't it? 
- It's small. I bet to get in and out, you gotta use a lot of lotion. 
- That's not funny. 
- Does your wife drive that car? - The Prius? 
Oh, sure. - Good. 
How's she doing? 
- My wife? 
She's fine. 
- Oh, good. 
How's the family? 
- They're fine. 
- Oh, good! 
I was just wondering. 
- Thanks a lot. 
- Everything's fine? - Everything's fine. 
I just want to make sure. 
Because I'm your pal. 
- Thank you. 
- So I'm concerned. 
- About what? - I was just thinking the other day. 
We're on the road a lot. 
You're away from home a lot. 
And your wife's at home alone. 
- Okay? - Yeah. 
- She's not exactly bad - looking. 
She's hot. 
And her prime is now. 
Yours was 20 years ago. 
And she's home. 
Are you sure? 
- Yeah. 
- How do you know? 
I trust her. 
What if she's been with someone else? 
Like... me! 
Oh, come on. You go purple, you never go back! 
I really don't think my wife has slept with you, Peanut. 
Well, think about this for a second. 
In a twisted kind of way - All five of us on stage have slept with your wife. 
When you're wacky and having a great time, that's me! 
When you're pissed off, lying there thinking why did I marry this broad? 
, that's Walter. 
When you're so angry you want to kill her, that's Achmed. 
So what is Jose Jalapeno on a Stick? 
You're a sick man! 
And here he is, Jose Jalapeno on a Stick! 
- Good evening, Jose. 
- Hola, Senor Heff. 
- It's good to see you. 
- Gracias, Senor Heff. 
- Excuse me! 
Who the hell is' Heff'? 
- That's Jeff. 
- No, he said' Heff'. 
- It's the same thing. 
No, it's not. 
- Jose, what did you say? 
- I say Senor Heff. 
What the f... 
Now he said' Cheff'. 
- It's all the same. 
- Didn't you watch Sesame Street? 
Jeff is Jeff, Heff is Heff and Cheff is Cheff. 
One of these things just doesn't belong here! 
Tonight's show is sponsored by the sound chhhhhh. 
- I'm sorry, Jose. 
- Is okay. 
He's an idiot. 
You're on a stick. 
Stica ka. 
I have a question for Josie. 
My name is Jose. 
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought we were in America, speaking fricking English. 
But I didn't see the little... over the' e'. 
Which magically changes Josie into fricking Jose. 
And I didn't see the... over the' n' which changes jalapeno into jalapeno. 
So a... over the' n' and a... over the' e'. 
Two keys I can never fricking find on a fricking keyboard. 
Apparently it's a secret known only to the Mexicans. 
So, Jose, when you're typing... 
Oh! I'm sorry. 
Talk about' hunt and peck'. 
- I'm sorry, Jose. - Is OK. 
I'll hire Achmed to kill him. 
So, what's your question? 
And be nice. 
- You're a jalapeno. 
- Si, senor. 
On a stick. 
- You're a Mexican jalapeno. 
- On a stick. 
Are you a legal Mexican Jalapeno? 
- What? 
What did I say? 
- This is not the appropriate time. 
Too late! 
So, Jose, are you legal? Are you legal, legal, legal, lega...? 
- What? 
- I know the answer to the question. 
Jose? 
Are you legal to be in this country? 
Si, senor. 
I have my green card. 
- Where is your green card? 
- Did you know he had another stick? 
- I had no idea. 
You know what that means? 
That means that one comes out! 
Oh my God! 
I thought it was just stuck up his ass. 
- What's wrong? 
- He doesn't have an ass. 
- It's just a jalapeno. 
- On a stick. 
I know! 
- How did he get on the stick? 
- I don't know. Probably a horrible pogo accident. 
Jose, immigration is a big topic in the country right now. 
Would you mind if I ask a few questions? 
There are more National Guard on the border between USA and Mexico. 
- Does this concern you? 
- No, senor. 
- Why not? 
- He's already here! 
You really are an idiot! 
Jose, are you here on a temporary visa, or on a work visa? 
He's here on a stick. 
- Do you enjoy being in this country? 
- Sometimes I'm afraid for my life. 
- Why? 
- Taco Bell. 
- Jose, do you have a new girlfriend? 
- Si, senor. 
- What, a fricking pickle on a pencil? 
- Stop it! 
- Peanut, are you prejudiced? - No! 
A bunch of my best friends are on sticks. 
Peanut, I meant are you prejudiced towards Mexicans? No. 
My mother's Mexican. 
Okay, I meant New Mexican. 
She's like Jose, just... fresher. 
- Jose, you speak English very well. 
- Gracias, senor. What were some of the first phrases in English that you learned? 
Will you help me push my car? 
- Does this ID look real? 
- Will you s... 
- Where's the nearest Home Depot? 
- Stop it! 
Actually, the last one was true. 
I'm sorry about this, Jose. 
I'm happy to have you in the act. 
- Just make sure he's legal. 
- He's legal. 
Why are you concerned? 
- Are you not concerned? 
- Why should I be concerned? 
- He works for you! Some of those laws pass and he's not legal, it's your ass thrown in jail. 
And trust me, you would not do well in prison. 
- Why not? - Come here, puppet boy! 
Make your daddy talk. 
That's nice. 
So you're pretty sure I'd soon become someone's... 
- Bitch. 
On a stick. 
You guys have been an awesome audience. 
Take a sample of her blood and then get rid of that. 
The Umbrella Corporation thought they'd contained the infection. 
Well, they were wrong. 
Raccoon City was just the beginning. 
Within weeks, the T-virus had consumed the United States. 
Within months, the world. 
The virus didn't just wipe out human life. 
Lakes and rivers dried up, forests became deserts and whole continents were reduced to nothing more than barren wastelands. 
Slowly but surely, the Earth began to wither and die. 
What few survivors there were learned to keep on the move. 
We avoided major cities. 
If we stopped anyplace too long, they would be drawn to us. 
Only a few at first, but then more and more. 
A never-ending army of undead. 
For those of us left staying on the road seemed the only way to stay alive. 
This is KLKB. 
We have seven people here in need of urgent medical attention. 
We need help. 
This is KLKB. 
Can anyone hear us? 
Can anyone help us? 
My baby. 
Please. Please help my baby. 
You bitch. You dropped my baby. 
" We're surrounded. We need help. 
Can anyone hear us? - Can anyone help us? Please." 
Let's see what else she's packing. 
I wouldn't do that. 
Shut your mouth! 
- Relax! - Just show the bitch. 
Eddie! Eddie! 
Jesus Christ! He's dead! 
Think you're pretty smart, huh? Well, you'll see. 
There you go, bitch. 
I wouldn't want it to be over too fast! 
Open the cage! 
Let them loose. 
That was a juicy one, huh? 
Hey, Carlos, this is Claire. 
- You got any smokes? - No. 
Like I'm supposed to believe that. 
Claire, would I lie to you? 
- L.J. 
- Claire Redfield, how can I help you? 
- Got any smokes? - No can do. 
How about alternate? 
Sorry to say we're out of that too. 
You gotta be shitting me. Otto? Sorry, campers. 
Smoked the last of it back in Salt Lake. 
Damn. - Yeah, people... 
- Damn it. 
... It really is the end of the world. 
- Anyone else? - Paris facility. 
Food supplies down to 50 percent. Six casualties. 
Biohazard numbers increasing. 
London facility. 
Food supplies down to 28 percent. Seventeen casualties. 
Biohazard numbers increasing. Gentlemen. 
Dr. Isaacs. 
How good of the science division to join us. 
Chairman Wesker. I've been busy. 
On the subject of the biohazard, what is the science division's report? 
Well, we now know conclusively that they have no real need for sustenance. 
They hunger for flesh but do not require it. 
My research indicates they could remain active for decades. 
We're to be trapped underground for decades? 
What news of Project Alice? 
Using antibodies from her blood I will develop a serum that will not just combat the effects of the T-virus but potentially reverse it giving back these creatures a measure of their intelligence their memories, thus curbing their hunger for flesh. 
You're confident you can domesticate them? 
They're animals, essentially. 
We can train them, if we can take away their baser instincts. 
They'll never be human but would provide the basis for a docile workforce. 
We can return to the surface. 
After months of experiments, you have nothing to show. 
- We are left to rot underground. 
- Without the original Project Alice progress has been difficult. 
I've been forced to replicate her using cloned genetic models. 
It's laborious. 
The results, unpredictable. 
Project Alice and the subject of domestication is of the highest priority. 
You will concentrate on this to the exclusion of all other research. 
We expect an updated report in a week. 
Simply demanding results will not guarantee them. 
Then perhaps we should place someone else in charge. 
Someone who can give us the reassurances we require. 
Continue with your research, doctor while it still is your research. 
This meeting is adjourned. 
Sorry about this, Stevie. 
This is Claire Redfield's convoy. 
Location, the Desert Trail Motel. 
Broadcasting for any survivors. ls there anybody in there? 
Broadcasting for any survivors. ls there anybody in there? 
Keep trying, Mike )' ls there anyone alive in there? 
Please respond. 
- Seems quiet. 
- Yeah, don't they always? 
Claire. Looks clear. Shall we go in? 
It's your call, boys. 
- Come on. 
Let's go. - Let's do it. 
I'm gonna get me a room. 
I'll take a waterbed, a Jacuzzi and I'm gonna rent me a porno. 
What happened? 
You two okay? 
Yeah. It's all clear. 
Somebody need my help? 
It's nothing. But if you insist... 
That's right. 
So sit back and relax. 
Spread out. Look for anything of use. Gas, food, ammo. 
You like playing rough, huh? 
- Oh, I've had worse. 
- I'm sure. 
But you've always been gentle with me, Betty. 
Oh, God. 
I'm leaving. 
So, what do we say, dinner at my place tonight? 
Oh, I'm there. 
This is amazing. 
He knows what it is. 
Camera. 
You try. 
Stand your ground. 
- My God. 
- Unbelievable. 
He has memory and reasoning skills. This is incredible. 
The serum works. You've domesticated them. 
You've done it. Congratulations. 
No, no, doctor. Please, no! 
Pork and beans. I'll get some peaches for the little one there. 
There you go. 
- It's asparagus. 
For you... cat food. 
Just kidding. It's pork and beans. - Hey. 
- What's this, huh? 
- Soup. Cream of mushroom. - Bullshit. 
- I think that's pork and beans too. 
- Thanks, man. - I'll be damned. 
- Asparagus. - How do you do that? 
- Just one of my skills. It's a dying art, unfortunately. 
This is the last of it. 
- I think it's some kind of fruit. - Thanks, Otto. 
Sorry, that's all we have. 
- Did you check out the gas station? 
- Yep, it's bone-dry. 
Well, how we looking here? 
Well, Claire, if we can run these trucks on rust we're looking pretty good. 
All right. 
Hey, sweetheart. 
Perimeter up yet? 
It's almost done. 
- Who's out there? 
- Olivera. 
- Hey, Carlos. 
- Claire. All that smoking is slowing you down. 
Get your ass in gear, old man. 
I want my perimeter up. 
Last sentinel in place. 
Perimeter's up and running. 
All motion sensors online. 
Cameras 100 percent. 
Refried beans. Fruit salad. 
Oh, my favorite. 
Storm's coming! 
Let's start packing it up and move it inside. 
Get back in the bus. Put this fire out. 
This is Claire Redfield's convoy. Location, the Desert Trail Motel. 
Lat. 35, long. 114. 
Activate Number 87. 
Shit. 
- Dr. Isaacs. 
- What is it? 
My sensors have detected a peak in psionic activity. 
Both alpha and beta wave. 
From Number 87? 
No, the activity's not from one of the clones. 
It occurred outside the complex. 
- That's not possible. 
- My sensors were quite clear. 
Massive psionic activity was detected 15 minutes ago centered on a desert location. 
- Claire! 
Oh, God. 
- Carlos. 
- I see them. 
Everybody stay in your trucks. 
What's going on? 
Everyone just stay in your trucks. 
Roll up the windows and keep quiet. 
Okay, close the windows up. 
What's wrong with their eyes? 
They've been feeding on infected flesh. 
- Fire it up. Let's get out of here. 
- That's a hell of an idea. 
Lock and load. 
- We're stuck! 
- Hell, no, let's get out of here. 
Let's head for the bus, come on. 
Come on! 
Go! Go! Come on, get in! 
Claire! 
Damn it. 
Mikey, Carlos, we have to evac the bus. You got it. 
Come on! 
Go! 
Go! 
Go! 
Get out of here, Betty! Go! 
- Move! 
Move! 
Move! - Go! 
- Betty! Betty! 
- L.J., hurry up! 
No! 
Betty! 
Go! Go! 
Dr. Isaacs. 
Another spike in alpha and beta waves detected. 
Forty-five percent probability that this is Project Alice. 
Triangulate. Find her location. 
Impressive. 
If it is her, her development is extraordinary. 
Her powers would appear to have grown at a geometric rate since her escape from the Detroit facility. 
You've made 10 trips to the surface in the past 24 hours. All unauthorized. 
Any trip to the surface, especially to gather specimens, puts my men at risk. 
Why do you need so many all of a sudden? 
Isaacs! 
My research has intensified. 
Don't worry. They're perfectly secure. 
You're supposed to be domesticating them. 
Sometimes aggression has its uses. 
What could you possibly need these things for? 
Dr. Isaacs. 
Specimen 87 has reached the final stage of the test grid. 
Perfect. Put her on the screen. 
Good girl. 
Is Chairman Wesker even aware of this? 
He knows what he needs to know. 
You've overstepped your mark. 
My research will change the face of everything. 
If you pick a side be sure it's the right one. 
Hi. 
H9 )' - 
This belong to you? 
I gave it to you last night. 
For luck. 
Thank you. 
What's your name? 
K-Mart. 
It's where they found me. 
Claire and the other... 
A few years back. 
Do you have another name? 
Never liked it. 
Everyone I knew was dead so seemed like time for a change. 
Anyone want to say something? 
Alice, this is Claire Redfield. 
She's the one who put this convoy together. 
Thank you so much for your help. 
Claire! 
Excuse me. I have things I have to attend to. 
In the last six months, she lost half of the convoy. 
Pretty soon there'll be more of us dead than alive. 
Alice, what happened to you? 
Why did you leave after Detroit? 
I didn't have a choice. 
They were using me. 
What do you mean? 
They were tracking me. 
I couldn't be around you. 
Any of you. 
- I would've gotten you all killed. 
- That's why you disappeared? 
Broke into an Umbrella facility and hacked into their computers downloaded the satellite trajectories and stayed off the grid. 
And after the world ended? 
Why stay out there alone? 
It's just safer if I'm not around people. 
Why'd you come back? 
Damn! 
What time is it? 
Chase, what time is it? 
Well, Carlos, it is 12 : 14. 
Why? 
You got somewhere you gotta be? 
Guess I'm just being paranoid. 
Welcome home. 
Got a minute? 
Yeah. 
Everyone is grateful for you helping us out. 
But how long am I gonna stay? 
Don't get me wrong. 
We really are grateful. 
They're all talking about what you did. And they're scared. 
I don't blame them. 
People have a habit of dying around me. 
Not just you. 
You're positive it's her? 
Sixty-two percent. Too great a chance to pass up. 
If it is Project Alice, she's been evading the satellite grid for years. 
I've re-routed the remaining satellites. 
We can reacquire the subject. She'll be unaware of surveillance. 
I can have a strike team ready within the hour. 
No. We'll establish a positive identification first. 
One hundred percent. 
The group she's with include known associates. 
The original Project Alice is vital to my research to the whole process of domestication. 
Her blood her genetic structure, is the key. 
The longer she's out there, the greater chance we lose her. 
- I can't risk that. 
- That decision isn't yours to make. 
Take no action until this matter has been discussed by the committee at the next scheduled meeting. 
And, doctor that's an order. 
These transmissions are the best indication of life we've seen in months. 
- Alaska? 
- We have to check it out. 
We can't just ignore it. 
Any idea what kind of journey that would be? - Yeah. A long one. 
- And at the end of it, what? 
You have no guarantee there's even anyone alive up there. 
- These transmissions say that- - 
- They're dated six months ago. 
How many radio broadcasts have we responded to? 
How many times have we got there too late? 
The transmissions say that there's no infection up there. 
It's isolated. 
Safe. 
This convoy trusts me with their lives. 
These people don't need pipe dreams. 
Maybe that's exactly what they need. 
Look at them, Claire. 
Six months ago, there were 50 of us, then 40, now there's less than 30. 
They're starting to give up. 
They need some kind of hope. 
We have a decision to make. 
And it's too big, it's too important for me to make for you. 
There's a chance there are survivors. 
Where? 
In Alaska. 
There is a chance that the infection hasn't reached that far. 
But we don't know for sure. 
So we have a choice. 
We stay as we are or we try for Alaska. 
For Alaska. 
Alaska. 
I hope you're right. 
The food's virtually gone and the truck's running on empty. 
I've got half a tank of gas. That's it. 
- Chase? 
- Shit, I don't even have empty. I got enough for a hundred miles, tops. 
If we're gonna make this trip, we'll need to resupply. Yep. 
These are our options. 
The nearest, safest bet is right there. 
No, it's empty. I tried that. 
Then, well, maybe... 
- We could try this- - 
- Vegas. 
It's the only place we're sure to find gas and supplies. 
There's a reason for that. Vegas is too dangerous. It's crawling with them sons of bitches. 
We've drained every small town dry over the last six months. 
We have to hit a big city. 
She's right. 
Vegas, it's our only bet. 
We'll establish a positive identification. 
The committee authorizes immediate action. 
Release of vehicles and personnel under command of Dr. Isaacs. 
That's an order. 
Hey. You all right? 
Yeah, I'm fine. 
Them pork and beans, they lethal. I don't see how you cowboys do it. 
Years of practice. 
Oh, my God. 
What happened to it? 
The desert must have taken it back. 
Five years. No one to keep the sand back. 
It's empty - 
No undead. Nothing. 
Those birds must have moved through the city block by block. 
Picked it clean. 
I don't see any truck stops. 
Where are they? 
There. Valet parking at the casino up ahead. 
There's gas pumps in there. 
Now, how do you know that? 
I dropped two G's back in the day here. 
You lost $ 2000? 
Damn it. 
Spread them out! 
We're gonna have to move it. 
All right, Chase, I need a lookout! 
Up there. 
Great. 
Climb the Eiffel Tower with a high-powered rifle. 
A few years ago, that would've caused a stir. 
Well, let the good times roll. 
Let's get this done. Get the hell out of here. 
Mikey, get the winch. 
- Yeah. 
- Carlos. 
Wait. 
Get back! 
Just get to the back and stay quiet. 
Get down! 
She really is magnificent. 
When she's dead, make sure you move in fast. 
I need a sample of her blood while it's still warm. 
That won't be a problem. 
- Satellite in position? 
- Yes, sir. 
Then shut her down. 
Mikey! 
Mikey! 
She's fighting the conditioning. 
Boost the control signal. 
Climb! 
Give me your hand! 
What is it? Satellite. 
Some kind of malfunction. 
HOW long? 
New feed coming online in 15 seconds. 
Online in three, two... Now. 
Where the hell is she going? 
Shut her down! 
She's still coming! 
- Now! 
- Oh, shit. 
You son of a- - 
Back to base! 
The anti-virus! 
Get me the anti-virus! 
Why didn't you shoot? 
Because we're not driving to Alaska. 
I want that helicopter intact. 
Let's go look at the computer, see where that chopper's headed. 
- How is he? 
- Under house arrest as you instructed. 
He's been quiet. 
How much of this have you used? 
Her blood increased the creatures' power. 
It also increased the strength of the infection. 
I needed it. 
You have no idea what this will do to you. 
Oh, I have an idea. 
You're out of control. 
Well, this ends here. 
Under executive order 1345, issued by Chairman Wesker for gross misconduct in the field I sentence you to summary liquidation. 
Liquidation? 
Just die. 
Take the body to the surface. Bring me the stats on Program Alice- - 
Sir! 
Good thing we like a challenge. 
Hold on. 
They have the anti-virus in there. 
Just hold on. 
It's too late, and you know it. 
Besides, you need a way to get in there. 
And I have an idea. 
- You keep them safe, huh? 
- You got it. 
Come here. 
Carlos, I- - 
Save it. 
You just promise me one thing. 
When you get down there... 
Consider it done. 
Wish I had a smoke. 
I'll be damned. 
L.J., you sneaky son of a bitch. 
Oh, hell. 
Get the kids out quickly! 
Take him! 
You're not coming? 
Take care of the others. 
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. 
- I am the artificial intelligence- - 
- I know what you are. 
I knew your sister. 
She was a homicidal bitch. 
My sister computer was merely following the most logical path... for the preservation of human life 
Yeah. Kill a few, save a lot. 
So, what happened here? 
Dr. Isaacs returned in an infected state. 
He was bitten by a creature that had been treated with a newly developed serum. 
A serum derived from your blood. 
The resulting infection has caused massive mutation. 
My blood? 
Your blood has bonded with the T-virus. 
Dr. Isaacs correctly deduced that it could be used to destroy the biohazard for good. 
You mean my blood is the cure for all this? Correct. 
So why are you helping me? 
Your blood is pure, and this facility contains all of the equipment you will require to synthesize a cure. 
- You mean this could all end? 
- Correct. 
There is, however a small problem. 
I have him contained in the lower levels... ... But I cannot hold him there for much longer. 
All right, let's go. 
Alice? Good luck. 
You can't kill me. 
I've told you I can't die. 
For so long, I thought you were the future. 
I was wrong. 
I am the future. 
No. 
You're just another asshole. 
And we're both gonna die down here. 
Yeah, you're the future, all right. 
All attempts to contact the North American facility continue to fail. 
How long have they been off the air? 
Seventeen hours. 
We must consider them lost. 
But our plans remain unchanged. 
All data will be transferred to this facility and the research will continue under my personal supervision. 
I expect results within one month. 
You won't have to wait that long, boys. 
Because I'm coming for you. 
And I'm gonna be bringing a few of my friends. 
... reckless sinful way throughout this life. 
The Lord has told me that the open gates of Hell are yawning up widely in our path. 
Yes, the flames of perpetual damnation are ever ready to grasp our souls. 
We know the way of the righteous man. 
Yeah, we know the prayer of the righteous man. 
I'm telling you that the Lord has spoken. 
Yes, the Lord has spoken to me. 
Hi. 
Mike Enslin. Checking in. 
Honey. 
Mr. Enslin. We were afraid you weren't going to show. 
Oh it's such an honor to have you here. 
- Terrible night out there. - If I could just get the key, I'll settle in and we can talk in the morning after... 
You probably want to hear all about our haunted history. 
Well, this staircase here, this is where the maid reputedly hung herself in 1860. 
- Oh. - There's a picture! 
- Can we do this in the morning? 
- Wait wait. It's printed in our brochure. 
- Did we send you one of these? 
- Uh, probably did. - Do you see her in the window? 
- Yeah, there she is. 
That's a photo that a guest took in 1986. 
In your letter you mentioned that the rooms with the most paranormal activity were in the attic. 
Could I have one of those rooms? That's right, because the attic is on the third floor which is the former servant's quarters. 
People say that all of Sylvia's children died up there of tuberculosis. 
- All of them? - Guests have reported strange sounds. 
At the stroke of midnight there's been weird noises. 
Now our best advice is to lock your door from the inside. 
- Isn't that right, honey? 
- That's right. 
You take care, you just lock it from the inside. 
I will. 
As soon as you give me the key. 
I'm so... right. 
Got it right here. 
- Number 14, you can't miss it. 
- Been a long drive. 
- All right, we'll see what the night brings. - Good luck. 
Mrs. Clark, the proprietor, says she hasn't slept a night since acquiring the inn and I believe her. 
No no no, I pity her. 
But in any case, the eggs Benedict are delicious and if you call in advance, Mrs. Clark says she will bake her famous flourless chocolate cake. 
On a Shiver Scale, I award the Weeping Beach Inn six skulls. 
Screw' em, five skulls. 
- Hi. 
- Oh hey. 
How's it going? 
Can I help you? Yeah, I'm here for the big event. 
All right. 
Cool. I'm Mike Enslin. 
Sorry? 
- Book signing. 
- Oh, right. Oh, that's you, yeah. 
I see the resemblance, yeah. 
- That's a good picture. 
- Thanks, man. 
All right, hold on. 
Um... attention, book lovers. 
Tonight we have noted occult writer 
Michael Enslin at the Author's Corner tonight. 
He's the writer of the best-selling ghost survival guides, um... with such titles as" 10 Haunted Hotels," 
" 10 Haunted Graveyards," 
" 10 Haunted Lighthouses." 
That's tonight, 7 : 00 pm. 
Anyway, so I really enjoyed writing it, and that's kind of a history of the book. 
And I hope you enjoy it, or enjoyed it. 
Uh, you know, stay scared. 
Right? Any questions? 
Where's the scariest place you've ever been? 
Scariest place I've ever been? 
Uh, I've never heard that question before. That's a joke. 
Well, all these places have very colorful histories. 
Um... I would say, if I had to pick a top one, 
I would say Bar Harbor, the site of the grisly McTeig wedding night murders. 
That's an intense place. 
Or maybe St. Cloud, Minnesota, where the crazed war widow threw her baby down a well. 
I mean, those all have a lot of... 
I mean, it's thick. 
- The air is thick. 
- What about poltergeists? 
Look, I'm a good researcher. 
I go into every gig locked and loaded. 
I travel with an EMF meter, full-range spectrometer, infrared camera. 
I mean, look, nothing would make me happier than to experience a paranormal event, you know, to get a glimpse of the elusive light at the end of the tunnel. 
So you're saying there's no such thing as ghosts? 
I'm saying I've never seen one, but they're awful convenient for desperate hotels when the interstate moves away. 
This thing has really gone off the rails. 
Who has a pen? - I do. 
- Which one? 
Uh, but seriously, Mike, if I want to see a real live ghost, where's my best bet? 
- Guaranteed? 
- Yeah. Haunted Mansion, Orlando. 
Awesome, thanks. 
- Stay scared. 
- Thank you. 
Hey, Ray, can you lock up? 
I got band practice tonight. 
Holy shit. 
What rock did you find that under? - Um, eBay. - eBay, huh? 
How much did it go for? 
Well, there weren't many bidders. 
I would think not. 
- Wow. 
- But it's, um... 
- an amazing book. - Oh. 
Um, so... unique and inspirational and honest. 
Thanks. 
What's your name? 
- Um, Anna. 
- Okay, Anna. 
Are you gonna write another one like this one? 
Nah, it's a different guy. 
Um... - can I ask you a question? 
- Sure. 
Um, the relationship in the book with the father and the son... 
it's probably too personal, - but, um, it's so authentic and... - Mm-hm. 
well-constructed, and... is it true? 
No. 
Well, thank you for this. 
I really appreciate it. 
My pleasure. 
Bye. 
- Yo, homey... Just a minute, Tiffany! 
Yeah, I'm just gonna tie it inside my suit here. 
Yo, Greg, check him out! 
Did you see what happened? 
Oh yeah. 
Are you okay, buddy? 
Hey, are you breathing? 
- No! 
- Serious as a heart attack. 
We got 325. 
That is back here, I think. 
Uh-huh. 
This is the one. 
Sign on the line, please, sir. Oh, you mean right here? 
- Have yourself a beautiful day. 
- Thank you. - Thank you very much. 
- Hey, man, you've been gone a while. 
- Hey, Jackson, what's up? 
- Oh by the way, dude, I read your last book... the" 10 Haunted Mansions" thing. 
Man, that's some scary shit. Cool. 
Later on, dude. - Hi. 
- Hi, how you doing? 
- Hi. 
- Good. 
Thanks. 
That's cute. 
Good evening, Dolphin Hotel. 
How might I direct your call? 
Yeah, hi, I'm calling about room 1408. 
One moment please, sir. 
How may I help you? 
Yeah, I'd like to stay in room 1408 please. 
That room is unavailable, sir. 
I didn't tell you which date. 
How about Saturday? 
It's unavailable. 
The following Tuesday? 
Unavailable. 
Next month? 
Unavailable. 
Next summer? 
Somebody, anybody, where's good Chinese near 48th? 
I got to have lunch with that idiot from Random House. 
Anybody? 
Sam, Mike Enslin calling from Los Angeles again. 
I'll take it in there. 
Clay, you got a sec for Mike Enslin? 
- Say yes. 
- Yes. 
Great. Now look, this guy tends to get a little morose, so try to keep the energy up. 
Otherwise he stews in his own funk. 
- Mike! 
- Hey, Sam. Hey hey, read the first five chapters last night. 
Spooky shit, couldn't sleep a wink. 
Great. 
Hey, did you take care of that thing? 
You'd better believe I did. 
And I got our top lawyer here right now. 
Mike, Clay, Clay, Mike. 
- Hi, Clay. 
- Mike. Talk fast, all right? 
This guy's $ 400 an hour. 
All right, Clay, what's up with the Dolphin? 
Yeah, the Dolphin. 
That stick-up-its-ass relic on Lexington. 
Too posh for a free plug, right? 
Well, you are gonna love what Clay's cooked up. 
He dug around and found you... 
are you sitting down? 
- a Federal Civil Rights law. 
Like somebody would discriminate against you, a well-to-do white guy. 
But the law's the law, right, Clay? 
Ergo, if the room's not occupied - they have to give it to you. 
- Really? 
Now look, the manager there's gonna put up a stink but he knows the drill. 
- Nothing you can't handle. 
- So, Mike... we'll book the room and if they refuse we'll rattle our sabers and file suit. 
- So it's all done? 
- Thanks, Clay. 
Get lost, all right? 
Bye, Clay. 
Yeah, Mike, are you there? 
Yeah, uh, on a more personal note, are you sure you want to come here? 
Yeah, of course. 
It'll make a solid closing chapter of the book. 
Yeah yeah, I know the routine. 
But, I mean, it's New York. 
All that happened... you really want to put yourself through that? 
- I'll be quick. 
- Are you gonna call Lily? 
No. I don't want to impose. 
In and out. 
Nobody gets hurt. 
It's just a job. 
Here you are, Dolphin. 
Hey! 
Taxi! 
It's a beautiful room, with fabulous views of the city. 
Pardon me, ladies. 
Thanks very much. 
Welcome to the Dolphin, sir. 
- Are you checking in? 
- Mike Enslin. 
One night. 
And how are we spelling that today? 
- N-S-L-I-N? 
- N-S-L-I-N. Yeah. 
Uh, would you excuse me for a moment, sir? Sure. 
Mr. Dempsey, Mike Enslin's just checked in. 
- Where is he? 
- He's over at my desk. 
That's fine, Marie. I'll take care of it. 
Okay. 
It'll just be a minute, Mr. Enslin. 
Good evening, sir. Can I help you with your bag? 
- No. - Very well. 
Mr. Enslin, I'm Gerald Olin, manager of the Dolphin. 
If there's anything that I can do for you while you're here... dinner reservations, theater tickets, maybe a Knicks game? 
Anything... just tell me. 
I am at your service. 
Well, if I can just get the key to 1408, I can get out of your hair. 
Oh, we were thinking of upgrading you to a penthouse suite. 
1408, please. 
Insistent, aren't we? 
Could you please humor me by coming to my office for a more private conversation? 
- Sure. 
- Excellent. 
Come in. 
Make yourself comfortable. 
1408 a smoking room? 
As a matter of fact, it is. 
Yes. Good, one less worry in the watches of the night. 
Care for a cigar? 
No thank you, I don't smoke. 
Oh this, yeah. 
That's... in case nuclear war breaks out. 
I gave it up a long time ago. 
It's part habit, part superstition. 
It's, you know, a writer thing. 
You do drink, don't you? 
Of course, I just said I was a writer. 
Le Cinquante Sept Deces, 1939. 
Exquisite. 
About $ 800 a bottle, when you can find it. 
I appreciate the bribe, but I intend on staying in that room. 
- How long? 
- How long? 
My usual is overnight. 
I see. 
No one's ever lasted more than an hour. 
Jesus, man. 
You ought to shave your eyebrows and paint your hair gold if you're gonna try to sell that spookhouse bullshit. 
Otherwise, you'll scare the children. 
Why are you mocking me when I am genuinely, to the best of my ability, trying to help you? 
No, you're playing a little game. 
You're selling the mystique. 
But eventually, we both know you're gonna give me the key and I'm gonna go up to the room and I'm gonna write my story and your bookings are gonna go up 50 %. 
Do you mind if my little friend records our conversation? 
I'll take that as a yes. 
Sir, you quite misunderstand the situation. 
Now, I know the Dolphin doesn't have the cachet of the Plaza or the Carlyle, but we operate at 90 % capacity. 
Always. 
And my concern here is not for the hotel. 
My concern here is not for you. 
Frankly, selfishly, 
I don't want you to check into 1408 because I don't want to clean up the mess. 
Now hotels are all about presentation and fertile creature comforts. 
My training is as a manager, not a coroner. 
Under my watch there have been four deaths... four. 
After the last one, I forbade any guest from checking into 1408 ever again. 
The last one was David Hide, orthodontist, manic-depressive. 
Slit his wrist, did a little self-surgery, turned himself into a eunuch, right? 
So you've done your homework. 
I'm a professional too. 
Well, grievously, in its 95-year existence, the hotel has seen seven jumpers, four overdoses, five hangings, 
- three mutilations... - Three mutilations... two stranglings. 
General manager Gerald Olin is well-versed in the hotel's tragic history, dryly reciting the docket of carnage like a bookkeeper discussing his ledger. 
Well, you think you're clever, don't you? 
I know the game. 
Well, during your investigation, did you discover the 22 natural deaths that have occurred in 1408? 
Natural deaths? 
Ah, didn't find out about them because the newspapers don't print anything about them. 
All told, there have been 56 deaths in 1408. 
56? You're shitting me. 
You don't know anything. 
The causes of death in 1408 range from heart attack, stroke, drowning... 
- Drowning? 
- Yes, one Mr. Grady Miller drowned in his chicken soup. 
That's hard to do. 
How... how did he do that? 
How indeed? 
Interesting. 
It's all in here. 
I will let you have this and give you access to my office. 
You can take notes, put it all in your book. 
My only condition is that you do not stay in that room. 
You'll let me look at all that stuff? Hmm. 
I never did get that drink. 
- Oh, that is good. 
- Here, keep it. 
Compliments of the house. 
- I'm still staying. - Damn it to hell! 
I'm sorry. 
All right here. Here, read the godforsaken thing. 
I guarantee you, once you've read it you won't want to stay in 1408. 
The first victim : Mr. Kevin O'Malley, sewing machine salesman. 
Checked into the hotel the first week it opened... 
- October, 1912. 
- Cut his own throat, right? 
Oh, that's not the horrific part. 
Afterwards, in a fit of insanity, he tried to stitch himself back together using an old sewing needle before he bled to death. 
Easy, man. 
Look, Mr. Enslin, you don't have to stay in 1408. 
You can take photographs of 1404. 
It has the exact same layout and no one will ever know the difference. 
- My readers expect the truth. 
- Your readers? 
Your readers expect grotesqueries and cheap thrills. 
" The headless ghost of Mr. Eugene Rilsby still walks his abandoned farmhouse." 
" The Barking Phantom of Mount Hope Cemetery." 
A direct quote... 
how'd you know that? 
Your books aren't hard to find. 
They're on the bargain shelves of any paperback novel store ; 
full of cynicism, written by a talented, intelligent man who doesn't believe in anything or anyone but himself. 
Guilty as charged. 
Hey listen, this meeting's over. 
Why don't you give me the room? 
Oh please, don't act like a hurt schoolgirl. 
- In fact, you surprised me. - Oh. 
You are not the hack-n-slash I expected. 
I rather liked the first one, the hardcover. 
What was it called? 
" The Last Walk..." 
" Long Road Home." 
" The Long Road Home," yes. 
I rather thought the father was a bastard. Yeah, he was. 
Look man, just give me the key. 
- Mr. Enslin... 
- Just give me the key! 
Listen, I stayed at the Bigsby house. 
I brushed my goddamn teeth right next to the tub where Sir David Smith drowned his whole family. 
And I stopped being afraid of vampires when I was 12. 
Do you know why I can stay in your spooky old room, Mr. Olin? 
Because I know that ghoulies and ghosties and long-legged beasties don't exist. 
Even if they did, there's no God to protect us from them, is there? 
So I can't talk you out of this? 
I think we've reached an understanding. 
Very well. 
Come with me. 
Most hotels have switched to magnetics. 
An actual key. 
That's a nice touch... it's antiquey. 
We have magnetic cards also, but electronics don't seem to work in 1408. 
Hope you don't have a pacemaker. 
General manager claims that the phantom in room interferes... 
I have never used the word" phantom." 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
Spirit? 
Specter? 
No, you misunderstand. 
Whatever's in 1408 is nothing like that. 
Then what is it? 
It's an evil fucking room. 
Please. 
Mr. Odin. 
Oh, oui. 
Tres bien. 
Why don't the owners just close the room? 
The Yasuko Corporation prefers to pretend there's no problem. 
Just as they pretend there's no 13th floor. 
The room, it's got to be filthy. 
I mean, the sheets haven't been changed in what? 
11 years? No no no, we're very professional. 
1408 gets a light turn once a month. 
I supervise, the maids work in pairs. 
We treat the room as if it's a chamber filled with poison gas. 
We only stay 10 minutes and I insist the door remain open. 
But still... 
A few years ago, a young maid from El Salvador found herself locked in the bathroom. 
She was only there for a few moments, but when we pulled her out, she was... 
- She was dead. 
- No, blind. 
She had taken a pair of scissors and gouged her eyes out. 
She was laughing hysterically. 
- Ouch. 
- Your floor. 
Well, this is where we part company. 
This is as close as I get to 1408 unless it's that time of the month. 
- See you tomorrow. 
- Mr. Enslin? 
Please... don't do this. 
I'll call you about those Knicks tickets. 
Stop it! 
Okay. 
It's okay, sweetie. 
We're home now. 
Here we go. 
This is it? 
You got to be kidding me. 
Round one goes to the hideous Mr. Olin for effective aggressiveness. 
I have to admit, he had me going for a moment. 
But where is the bone-chilling terror? 
Show me the rivers of blood. 
It's just a room. 
$ 8 for beer nuts. 
This room is evil. 
Olin said hotels are about fertile creature comforts. 
It's a good line, but I wonder whether they're really about reassuring platitudes, a prosaic sense of the familiar. 
" Yes, I've been here before. 
It's safe." 
There's a sofa, a writing desk, a faux antique armoire, floral wallpaper. 
Carpet's unremarkable, except for a stain beneath a thrift-store painting of a schooner lost at sea. 
The work is done in the predictably dull fashion of Currier and Ives. 
The second painting is of an old woman reading bedtime stories... 
a Whistler knockoff... to a group of deranged children as another Madonna and child watch from the background. 
It does have the vague air of menace. 
The third and final painfully dull painting is the ever-popular" The Hunt." 
Horses, hounds and constipated British lords. 
Some smartass spoke about the banality of evil. 
If that's true, then we're in the seventh circle of Hell. 
It does have its charms. 
The panorama is typically cramped New York City view of nothing : 
Dull, grey buildings all around ; 
Honking traffic below. The view of a... 
Holy shit. 
Bravo, Olin. 
That is very unsettling. 
That means someone's in the room. 
Hello? 
Hello! 
Whoa. 
That is bizarre. 
Finally I got something to write about. 
A ghost that offers turn-down service. 
All right. 
All right, let's Encyclopedia Brown this bitch. 
Started off the window, hear the music, nab my head. 
I turn around, go to the bed for the chocolate. 
Then I go into the closet which would have... my back was turned. 
It would have let 
Houdini have time to come in here do the paper trick... and he's in the living room. 
Out! 
Hello? 
You're gonna have to try harder, asshole! 
Nice and warm for you up there? 
It's hot down here, bubba. 
Come on. 
- Front desk. 
- Hello, this is Mike Enslin. 
- Guess which room. 
- Good evening, sir. 
- Good evening. - Are you ready to check out? 
Check out? 
No no no no no. 
Check out, check out, no. Why would I check out? 
Especially with this wonderful maid service. 
It's so discreet. 
No no no, I need you to send somebody to fix my thermostat. 
- Room's on fire. 
- Of course, sir. 
We'll send an engineer right up. 
- You will? 
- Absolutely. 
- Thank you. - You're welcome. 
How many thin walls have we put up with together, old boy? 
How many sarcophagal chambers? 
Hotel rooms are a naturally creepy place... don't you think? 
I mean, how many people have slept in that bed before you? 
How many of them were sick? 
How many of them lost their minds? 
How many of them... died? 
We came here to get the story, and we don't rattle, do we? 
It's not that what I'm seeing is not real. 
It just ain't as real as it seems. 
Hello? 
You got a problem with the temperature? 
Yeah. 
Come on. 
Is it too hot or too cold? 
What does it look like? 
Come on in. 
The box is right over here. 
It's stuck around 80. 
I said the box is right here. 
I know where the hell it is, but I ain't going in this room. 
You just have to walk six or seven feet. 
I said I ain't going in. 
You know what happened in here? 
Yes, I'm well aware of that. 
Look, I'll talk you through it. 
Any jackass can fix that thing. 
Just remove the panel. 
Okay, now above that coil is a little tube filled with mercury. 
That's supposed to activate the contact switch. 
But this hotel's so goddamn old, half the shit in here don't work. 
Just give the tube a little tap. Just tap the damn thing! 
Yeah, there it is. 
Let me give you... a tip. Oh, sir, you're a genius. 
A gentleman and a scholar. 
Thank you. 
Sir? 
Son of a... 
Nobody lasts more than an hour. 
Very effective. 
Oh fuck! 
Jesus! 
Oh, God. 
Ow! Son of a... 
Ow! Fuck! Agh! 
Ow! God! 
Hello? 
- Hello? 
- Sir, I'm afraid there was a miscommunication in the kitchen. 
There's going to be a 10-minute delay with your sandwich. 
Sandwich? 
What sandwich? I didn't order any sandwich. 
What are you talking about? 
You're welcome to substitute a side dish for your French fries. I'm sorry. 
We have cottage cheese, macaroni salad, 
- coleslaw... 
- Listen to me. 
You win. I'm checking out. 
I'm hurt. 
Do you understand? 
My goddamn hand is hurt. 
I understand. 
If you leave your dry cleaning out by 10 : 00 AM, we'll have it pressed and returned by 5 : 00... 
Shit, bitch! 
Call me a cab to the nearest hospital! I'm hurt! 
Do you comprehend what I'm telling you? 
Sir, I will not tolerate you speaking to me in that tone of voice. 
You're an idiot! 
I'm gonna sue your ass! 
I'm gonna take legal action! What's wrong with you? 
If you wish, I can connect you with our manager Mr. Olin. 
Good! Good good good good good! 
Put him on. 
Put him on. 
I'm gonna blitz the son of a bitch. 
Olin... good! 
Put him on now! 
When staying at the Dolphin, be certain to enjoy 
New York's finest dining at the fabled Sea Bream restaurant on our mezzanine level. Muscles tense? 
Then make an appointment to visit our deluxe spa on the Coral level. 
With full massage, facial and aromatherapy facilities, 
- it will leave you feeling relaxed... 
- Hello? and revitalized. 
Your call is important to us... You bitch. 
You win. You win. 
All right. 
Okay! 
Come on. 
Come on! 
Come on. Come on. 
Hey! 
Help! 
Help! 
Help! 
Help! 
Can anybody hear me? Help! 
You! Sir! 
Sir! 
Help! 
Yeah! 
Yeah, you! 
Help! 
Help! 
Help! 
You, sir! 
Help! 
Can you see me? 
Yeah! 
The Dolphin Hotel! 
Call the police! 
Help! 
Help! 
Hey! 
Look out! 
Hey! 
I'm losing my mind. 
I can see you, Dad. 
Daddy? 
Daddy, where are you? 
I'm gonna get you. 
Ready or not, here I come. 
Here you are. 
I see you, Daddy. 
Get ahold of yourself. 
You're running to places that aren't real. 
Get up. 
Get up. 
You're losing the plot. 
You're losing the whole goddamn structure. 
Daddy! 
Find me. 
Psychokinetic fibrillations. 
A tired mind among classic haunted-house powers of suggestion. 
Gaslit features, faded rugs, like that motel in Kansas. 
There's a reason for everything. 
Just think. 
What's that? 
What is that? 
Is that a spycam? 
Who is that? 
Are you enjoying this? 
Is that the sadistic owner of the hotel or is that Olin? 
Wait a minute. 
He gave me booze. 
He gave me booze. 
Did he take a sip? 
I can't remember. 
He dosed me! 
It was the booze or the chocolates. 
Never take candy from strangers. 
All right, all right. 
I'm just hallucinating. 
I'm just hallucinating. 
I've just got to ride this out. 
I've got to ride this out for four or five hours and I'm straight. Okay. 
You can do this. 
Oh, man. 
I'm gonna get you. 
You are finished. 
Come here. Come here! 
Dad! 
Sit down! 
You want me to sit down? 
You want me to sit down? 
- Yes! - Okay, hold on, hold on. 
Let me find a good... let me find a good frame here. 
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Most Ugliest Person Competition. 
Fifth and fourth place goes to Boris and Doris the goldfish. 
Ladies and gentlemen! 
Let's get a closeup of those guys. 
Let's have a closeup of Boris and Doris. 
Look at that. 
Those are some ugly fish. 
They're so ugly they're running from you. 
Third place goes to Mike Enslin. 
Surprise surprise. 
Right, how's this for ugly? 
Second place goes to Lily Enslin. That was good. 
That's kind of like Beowulf meets a redneck. 
- And first place goes to Katie Enslin. 
That is a terror. 
That is... oh, God! 
Don't show me that face! 
Oh, I can't look at it again. 
Whatever you do, don't turn around. Whatever you do, don't show us that face. 
Ma'am, can you hear me? 
Ma'am, I need your help. 
Please, ma'am, can you hear me? 
Kid, be quiet. 
Please, ma'am. 
Quiet! 
I... wish... 
I was dead. 
Where's my garden? 
I can't smell anything. 
I hate this place. 
How did I get here? 
Pop. 
Dad. 
It's Michael. 
As you are... 
I was. 
As I am... you will be. 
Maybe I'm not real. 
Maybe I'm just having a nightmare... an incredibly vivid lucid nightmare. 
When is the last time I remember going to bed? 
I flew in yesterday. 
Or was that... today? 
I can't remember. 
Was I on a train? 
I woke up somewhere and I had breakfast. 
Where was I? 
What did I eat? 
Here it comes. 
They say you can't die in your dreams. 
Is that true? 
The shock would wake you up. 
So you couldn't really die. 
All right, what are our options? 
Got the hallway, got guest rooms on either side, stairwell, fire exits. 
And that's the next window... the next room. 
How many feet across is that? 
One three, four, five, six, seven, eight... nine. 
Nine, nine... 
18 feet across. 
Okay. 
I can do this. 
If something should happen, if I should slip and fall, 
I want it to be known that it was an accident. 
The room... did not win. 
Okay. 
Okay, I can do this. 
18 little steps. 
Four... 
Don't look down. Five... 
Keep moving. 
Here we go. 
All right. 
Okay. 
Number nine... eight... six... 
Where is it? 
Where is it? 
Get ahold of yourself. 
You're running to places that aren't real. 
Hotel rooms are naturally creepy places. 
Strangely, the bedroom has no window. 
Dr. Edwards to Oncology. 
Please, please. 
No. 
No. 
Doctors don't know everything. We can get another opinion, look for other treatment. 
- You hear about... 
- Look at me. 
... miracle cures. 
- Lily. Oh God. 
Please, something. 
What kind of god would do this to a little girl? 
Katie. 
Daddy, I can't see you. 
Daddy, I can't find you. 
Daddy, I'm scared. 
- Katie. 
- I'm scared, Daddy. 
Help. 
Help me. 
Daddy, help me. 
Okay, how about the wireless? Come on. 
Give me a signal. 
Give me a signal. 
Good evening, Mike. 
Oh, yes! 
Mike? 
Mike, is that... 
is that you? 
- I can barely see you. 
- Yes yes. - It's like seeing a ghost. 
- No no no. 
Yes, it's me. 
- It's me. It's Mike. 
- This is a little bizarre. 
I mean, I haven't talked to you in a year and suddenly you pop up in a box on my computer. 
I'm sorry, Lily. 
Listen to me, please, quickly. 
Look, I'm at work, okay? 
So why don't you call me at home tonight? 
I'm trapped in this room, this place. 
Mike, you're always trapped in weird places. 
That's your job. No no, please, Lily. 
Listen to me. 
- Please. 
- Lily Enslin. 
- Hi. 
Yeah yeah. 
- Lily! 
- I've got those. 
I'll be right down. 
Lily! Lily, please! 
Call the cops. 
Send them to the Dolphin Hotel. 
I'll call you back. 
- You're in the city? 
- 2254 Lexington. - What are you doing in New York? 
I'll tell you later. 
The Dolphin Hotel, room 1408. 
- That's just perfect. 
- Please. 
You walk out, you disappear. Leaving me what? 
Not divorced. 
Separated? 
I don't know, it's not clear. 
- Suddenly you need me? 
- Lily, I'm in a real bad spot here. 
- I'm in danger. 
You understand? 
- Okay, Mike. 
Slow down. 
You're not making any sense. 
There's something trying to kill me right now. 
No, Lily! 
No no no! 
I've got a knife! 
That's the way out. 
Or that way. 
Or that way. 
All right, that's the way out. 
Lady, let me in! 
- Help! 
Help! 
- Please, sleep. 
- Lady, I'm coming through! 
- Mike! Mike, can you help me? 
Where'd you go? 
I got to get some cigarettes. 
You want something? 
Jesus Christ! 
I've got to go. 
I'll be in California. 
Mike, you can't do this. 
She needs you. 
She lost a kid too. You've got an amazing talent for stating the obvious, Pop. 
You think I don't know that? 
I'm trying to talk some sense into your head! 
- Don't put your hands on me, old man! 
- Mike! Talk? 
Why change what appears to be the habit of a lifetime, Pop? 
You were always great at passing judgment, but the problem is you never gave a shit. 
I never gave a shit because you're a bullshit writer! 
Shit! 
Hello! 
Kevin O'Malley. 
No. 
No no no no no no. 
I can't help you. 
I can't help you. 
No! 
It's good to be back. 
That's enough of that. 
Alcohol. 
I was just checking to see if the accommodations are exceeding your expectations. 
You know goddamn well they are! 
- What do you want from me? 
- No no no. 
What do you want? 
What do you want, Mr. Enslin? 
- You sought this room. 
- It was a job. I was doing the job. 
- I beg your pardon? 
- My job! I'm a writer. 
Oh, that's right. 
You don't believe in anything. 
You like shattering people's hopes. 
Oh, that's bullshit! 
Why do you think people believe in ghosts? For fun? 
No. 
It's the prospect of something after death. 
How many spirits have you broken? 
She was in so much pain. 
I'm sure she's smiling down on us right now. 
What do you want from me? 
Huh? 
What do you want from me? 
You... you little... 
What do you want? 
What? ! 
I want my drink! 
You win. 
You win. 
- Mommy? 
- Hmm? Why is the Bible purple? 
I don't know why it's purple. 
It was a wedding present. 
My grandmother brought it all the way from Hungary. 
Someday it'll be yours. 
Are there people where I'm going? 
Hey, you're not going anywhere, kiddo. 
You're gonna stay right here with us. 
Daddy... everyone dies. 
When they're old. 
When they're much older. 
Okay, and then they go to a better place. 
And it's beautiful there. 
And all your friends will be there. 
Is God there? Yes. 
Do you really believe that, Daddy? 
Yes. 
You know what I think! 
We should have done more! 
- We did everything we could! 
- No, we didn't! - We should have helped her fight... 
- Oh my God. 
... instead of filling her head full of these stories about heavens and the clouds and nirvana and all that bullshit! 
Those stories, she like them. 
I'm going to get some cigarettes, okay? 
We ponder the situation. 
I'm trying to accurately describe... 
Orpheus on the Orpheum Circuit bathed in tango light, the kind of light that makes the dead... get out of their graves and tango. 
Now this is level nine... the deepest level of hell, furthest removed from all light and warmth. 
This is six. 
It's goddamn five. 
I think I see the pattern. 
Yes, I can see the pattern. 
Mike. 
Mike, can you hear me? 
- Michael, where the hell are you? 
- Lily. 
Michael? 
- Mike. 
- Lily. Michael, can you hear me? 
Lily. 
Oh my God. 
Thank God. Jesus, I've been trying to get through! 
- Did you call the cops? 
- Yeah yeah, they're at the hotel. 
- Didn't you say the Dolphin? - Yes. 
- You're sure? 
- Yes yes, 1408. 
Mike, they're in 1408. 
The room's empty. 
Mike? 
Michael, can you hear me? 
Michael? 
Michael, where the hell are you? 
I'm afraid I can't express myself in this climate. 
Calm down, okay? 
We'll figure this out. 
- Don't panic. 
- I'm supposed to die here. 
Michael, stop it! 
You're not gonna die, okay? 
Don't move. 
I can be there in 15 minutes. 
Mike? 
Michael? 
15 minutes isn't enough time. 
- It'll be too late. 
- No, it won't be too late. 
- Lily. 
- Don't... 
Actually, 15 minutes is perfect. 
It's perfect. 
Just come up. 
Come now. 
- Good, yes. 
- I need you. You've always been someone I can count on. 
I know we haven't talked a lot since... since Katie died, 
- but I need you, sweetie. 
I can't explain it here. 
You just have to come here and talk to me. 
I miss you too, but... 
When you get here, don't talk to anybody. 
Just come straight up to the 14th floor. 
- Walk through the door. 
- Shut up! Shut up! - It's life or death, sweetie. 
- Do not come up to the room! 
- Okay. - Don't come up to the room! 
- I need to talk to you about Katie. 
- Don't! 
Shut up! 
- Lily, don't listen to him! 
- Yes, good. - It's a trick! 
Don't come up here! - I'll be right there. 
Lily! 
Lily! 
My baby! 
My baby! 
She's heading for the rocks! 
I don't want to die! 
Oh God! 
Man overboard! 
Come on! 
Are you okay, buddy? 
Hey, are you breathing? 
Come on, talk to me. 
You guys, give me a hand here! 
Dr. Edwards to Oncology, please. 
Hey. 
How are you feeling? - Am I out? 
- You're okay. 
You're okay. 
Lie down, lie down, lie down. 
Lie down, lie down, lie down. 
You're okay. 
You're in the hospital. 
Hospital where? 
In New York? 
New York? 
No no, you're in LA. 
You got hit on the head with your board. 
I can't believe you still surf. 
You flew here just for me? Yeah. 
Yeah, I was worried. 
They called. 
I think I'm still listed as your next of kin. 
Okay, I'm not in New York. 
- I'm out. 
- Why do you keep saying that? 
I was in New York. 
I was trapped. 
In New York, I was dying in this Kafkaesque hotel, the Dolphin. 
- What? - The Dolphin Hotel on 45th and Lex. 
- I spoke with you there. 
- 45th and Lex? 
- I called you. 
- I've never heard of it. 
You're gonna be okay. 
You just need to rest. 
Oh, we have a winner. 
600 bucks. 
Unbelievable. 
I can see why you live here. 
Why did you leave? 
Because every time I looked at you, I saw her face. 
I think it's pretty clear. 
I think in the dream the room's your subconscious and it brought up a lot of stuff. 
That's a good thing for you. 
But this was... 
I mean, I was down the rabbit hole. 
I was rattled. 
I was shook up. 
And I can't shake it. 
I think after dinner you should drive me back to the hospital, check me into the psych unit. 
You look really great. 
I can't believe I'm sitting here with you. 
Tell me about it. 
Is everything all right? Can I get you anything else? 
I'll have another glass of wine, please. 
The same. 
Mike? 
Yeah, I'll have another tequila... 
Patron, chilled, double. 
Be right back. 
Katie was there. 
Can you imagine what it feels like to have the sensation? 
I mean, the very real sensation that I talked to her, like, two days ago? 
I talked to her, saw her, touched her. Yeah. 
I see her every night when I shut my eyes. 
Yeah, but it was so vivid. 
It was so real. 
Maybe you should write about it. 
About Katie? 
Shit. 
- You always were tougher than me. 
- Why not? Seriously, it sounds like you're ready to deal with this stuff. 
Can you stay? 
I'm sorry. 
Okay, we have got 148. 
148 is gonna be right about... 
Uh-huh. So if you'd like to sign on the line. 
Hey! 
Hey, man! 
You've been gone a while. 
Oh, by the way, dude, I read your book. 
What is it? " 10 Most Haunted Motels," right? 
That's some scary shit. 
See you around. 
Did I drop a postcard? 
- What? 
- Did I? - Huh? 
- A postcard. 
No, I think I would have seen it. 
But if I find it, I'll put it in your mailbox. Okay? 
My experience in the room was terrifying, a fragmented loop of unease and despair. 
1408 was a horrible dream, yet somehow I awoke from it renewed. 
Mikey! 
You sound happy. 
- You're scaring me. 
- I wouldn't go that far, but I must say that the work is just pouring out of me. 
I think I've actually reinvented myself in the form of a kind of a fictional memoir... 
" Autobiography of a Nightmare : 
Truman Capote meets H.R. Giger." What do you think? I love it! 
" In Cold Blood" with" Aliens!" 
That's sexy. I wanna put it out to auction, start a bidding war. 
When can I read it? 
Easy, tiger. 
Any day now. You're gonna get it as soon as I finish. 
Okay, Mike. 
Less talking, more writing. Hey, where's that decaf? 
I'm dying here. 
Thank you. 
Hey, Pop. 
How are you doing, old boy? 
Can you hear me? 
I don't think so. 
I know I haven't been here in a few months, but I just wanted to... come by and see how you're doing and... tell you I was doing okay. 
Doing pretty good, actually. 
I started talking to Lily again. 
And I wrote a new book, which I actually think you would like... believe it or not. 
Michael. 
Dad. 
Michael. 
Yeah. 
So... 
Hey, you can't park there! 
Move it down, will you? 
Hey, I got a package I need to overnight. 
Is this the right form? 
I got to get this to New York by tomorrow morning. 
I'm sorry, sir, but we're closed. 
Very well. 
I was out. 
Is that Katie? 
Is that Katie? 
I was out. 
I was out! 
I was out. 
Please, God. 
I know I was out. 
Yeah. 
Open it. 
... are yawning up widely in our path. 
We know the way of the righteous man. 
Daddy. 
- Daddy? 
- No. 
- You're not Katie. 
- I need help. 
Please. 
You're not real. 
I'm cold. 
- You're not Katie. 
- So cold. 
I love you, Daddy. 
Don't you love me anymore? 
Of course I do, sweetheart. 
There we go. 
I got you. 
I got you now, Katie. 
- Oh my God. 
- They won't let me stay. 
- Yes, they will. 
- They won't let me stay. 
- What? - They won't let me stay. 
No no no no no. 
Nobody's ever going to take you away again. 
I got you now, Katie. 
Oh my God. 
- I'm not gonna let you go. - Do you love me, Daddy? 
Of course I do. 
I love you more than anything in the world. 
I wish we could stay together, you, me, and Mommy. 
We can, we can. 
I got you right here. 
I got you right here, sweetie. 
Everything's fine. 
Everything is fine. 
No. 
No. 
No. 
No. 
You can't take her twice. 
You can't. 
Not again. 
Please, God. 
You can't. 
Please. No! 
No. 
You bastard. 
You little... where is it? 
Where? 
! 
Where? ! 
Why don't you just kill me? 
Because all guests of this hotel enjoy free will, Mr. Enslin. 
You can choose to relive this hour over and over, or you can take advantage of our express checkout system. 
Mr. Enslin? 
Are you ready to check out, Mr. Enslin? 
No. 
- Not your way. - I understand. 
By the way, Mr. Enslin, your wife just called. 
She'll be here in five minutes and we'll send her straight up. 
She's not involved. 
You can't have her. 
I'm done arguing with you. 
I'm gonna end this. 
Five. 
This is five. 
Ignore the siren. 
Even if you leave this room, you can never leave this room. 
Eight. 
This is eight. 
We have killed your friends. 
Every friend is now dead. 
I lived the life of a selfish man. 
But I don't have to die that way. 
If I'm going down, 
I'm taking you with me. 
This may not all be real, and I may not even be real, but this fire... that's got to be real. 
Go to hell! 
Get out onto the street! 
Out the doors and onto the street, please. 
Everyone stay calm. 
- What's going on? 
- I don't know, lady. 
This might take a while. 
Something must have happened. 
Thanks. 
Keep quiet, you bastard. 
Please, you've gotta help me. 
No, help me. 
- Calm down. - My husband's inside. 
My husband's inside. 
You've gotta help him. You've gotta help him, please! 
What floor? 
What floor? 14th floor, 1408. 
Mike Enslin. 
Please come here. 
You're wasting your time. 
We're here to do the job, and we don't rattle. 
The decor is in tatters and the staff surly. 
But on the Shiver Scale... 
I award the Dolphin 10 skulls! 
Never kill more than you can eat. 
Daddy, everyone dies. 
We commend to Almighty God our brother, and we commit his body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. 
May you rest in peace. 
Amen. 
Amen. 
Well, they're together now. 
Let's go. 
Mrs. Enslin? 
I... 
I am sorry to intrude at such a delicate time, but I knew your husband. 
I worked at the Dolphin. Oh. 
While we were cleaning up, we came across some of his belongings. 
No, thank you. 
They are of such a personal nature, ma'am. - I figured maybe you would want to... 
- No, please. 
It's not how I want to remember him. 
I'm sure you understand. 
Oh yes, yes. Of course I understand. 
But it's important that you know that he did a great thing. 
He did not die in vain. 
What are you talking about? 
Because of him, the room won't reopen. 
It's been... All right, okay, stop. 
Just give the lady some air. 
She's been through enough, don't you think? 
Round one goes to the hideous Mr. Olin for effective aggressiveness. 
I have to admit, he had me going. 
Get ahold of yourself. 
You're running to places that aren't real. 
Daddy, don't you love me anymore? 
Of course I do, sweetheart. 
- Don't you love me, Daddy? 
- Of course I do, honey, more than anything. 
I got you now. 
I got you right here, sweetie. 
Everything's fine. 
I got you, Katie. 
Nobody's ever gonna take you away again. 
Daddy? 
Daddy! 
Daddy! 
Daddy! 
Daddy! 
Hey, sweetie. 
Daddy! 
Daddy! 
Yes, of course. 
I told you I would. 
- I felt it. 
I felt it before you came. 
Our time together is paying off. 
Stop. You have to leave. 
Is that your wish? 
Each time we meet like this, I feel - 
Weak. I feel drained. 
( Whispering ) Perhaps that is what love does to a woman. 
I know that poets claim they would die for it. 
- Would you die for it? 
- Perhaps. - In a poem. 
- ( Laughs ) 
- ( Chuckles ) 
There are many things in this world your father doesn't know. 
Let this be one of them. 
Sacrilege. 
This is madness, Gallian. 
you go too far. 
( man ) may the gods save us. 
Use your legs. 
- It's those big ones that are always the toughest. 
Things worthwhile don't come easy. 
You missed. 
As long as they don't eat the crops. 
Same deal as always? 
Winter's corn for the pig? Same deal. 
Deal never changes. 
It's been a tough dry season, hasn't it? 
- I've seen rougher. 
- King's recruiting. 
Soldiers get taken care of really well. 
I have this land. 
Isn't that enough? 
you get older, you get tired ofjust surviving 
I mean, where's the courage in just surviving? 
Damn it, Farmer, would it kill you to just talk for a little while? I mean, we're not animals. 
People actually do converse with one another. 
Norick, if I could talk these turnips out of the ground, I would. 
When the rains come, this ground turns to clay. 
Not even you could talk' em out of the ground then. 
That's what I love about your old man, Zeph. 
He always knows how to set a mood. 
- Show Norick where we stack his corn. 
Here you go, Zeph. 
Have a pig. 
- ( Laughing ) - ( Squealing ) 
( Farmer ) Guess you'll be staying for supper. 
Well, since you asked. 
Norick, it is so good to see you. You should come by more often. 
Well, I figure Farmer saw enough of me when he was growing up. 
Now that he's got a family ofhis own, maybe he needs a little bit of a break. 
Norick thinks Father should quit farming and join the king's army. 
- ( Gasps ) - Now hold on a second. 
I didn't say that exactly. He says the king's soldiers make a lot of money. 
Farmer, you're not seriously considering this, are you? 
You're my family. I'm not going anywhere. 
- That answer your question, Norick? 
- I was just talking. 
- Just talking. - Well, everyone's got a talent. 
- Just talking seems to be yours. 
- ( Zeph, Woman Laugh ) 
Just ratting on his friends seems to be yours. 
- Can I have some chicken, please? - Don't give it to him. 
- Give me the chicken. 
Har, har, har. 
- ( Zeph Laughs ) 
Tell me how you love me. 
You know. 
I only know what you tell me... and you tell me nothing. 
Look at these hands - Broken to feed us. 
These hands speak louder than words. 
What is the cost of telling me? 
What more could you want? 
A little passion. 
- A little passion? 
Well, let me see what I can do. 
( Farmer ) I have all those fields to clear. 
Remember-When men build lives from honest toil - 
- Courage never fails. 
- ( Laughs ) 
That's right. 
I hate sleeping without you. 
Be safe. 
Of course we'll be safe. 
Doesn't he have a name? 
Your father believes that people become what they do. 
Norick brought him to Stonebridge when he was just little. 
So Norick is his father? 
The whole town adopted him. 
Different families took him at different times. 
But Norick - He always kept a special eye out. 
I'm glad he has a family now. 
I'm glad it's us. 
Mmm! 
So am I. 
General. 
Report to your king. 
Savage army. 
The Krug - They-They fight with swords. 
This is ridiculous. 
It's as if you were talking about armed dogs. 
They fight like men. 
They killed off our entire scouting party. 
Had the general not ordered me to return with word, I should be dead as well. 
This is some sort of sorcery. 
( Chattering ) 
( No Audible Dialogue ) 
( Woman ) Zeph, is that you? 
( Laughs ) I've got you. 
Into the oven with you. - ( Laughs ) 
- I hate the oven. 
It's dry, it's warm. 
You don't want us to eat you raw, now, do you? 
Why do you have to eat me? 
Tonight, I promised your grandfather... we're going to eat a dish he really loves. 
( Rumbling Continues ) 
Of course, the men tried to take advantage of me because I'm a woman... so I make them pay more - because I'm a woman. 
- ( Laughing ) 
- When we were kids you were always in charge. 
- Always the leader. - No, I just knew what I wanted, that's all. 
Until she met your father. 
Your father does not take orders very well from anybody. 
- Shall we go? 
- We have to be careful. 
The bell tower was made for times of war. 
you don't want to pull the wrong rope and start a war, do you? 
( Grunting, Snarling ) 
( Norick ) Hah! 
What took you so long? 
( Grunting, Groaning ) 
They don't have armor and weapons. 
I need to use your horse, Norick. 
- Where are you going? 
- Stonebridge. 
- Solana and Zeph are there. 
- I'm coming with you. 
Farmer didn't come? 
My husband likes to leave the trade to me so that he can farm. 
You did well for a husband. 
He loves you very much. 
Yes. Yes. 
I believe he does. 
( man ) When the bride and groom kiss, ring the bell five times... signaling their marriage for the village to hear. 
( Grunting ) 
Take Zeph home now. 
You can protect him, Father. 
Protect him. 
( Grunting ) 
Giving up so soon? 
Your progress is truly remarkable. 
- Let mejoin your army and you shall. 
- ( Grunts ) 
I am not quite sure that the armies of Ehb are ready for women warriors. 
Besides, what would your father say? 
My father never lets me do anything I want. ( man ) Tarish.! 
Prepare your troops to ride. Hordes of Krug are ransacking the land. 
Oh, the sun is blistering my skin. 
What is this nonsense you speak? 
I listen only to the king. 
It might behoove you... to learn a little respect. 
You are mistaken. 
Respect is my birthright! 
( Clamoring ) 
( Shouting, Screaming ) 
( Man ) To the village, everyone! 
- She's-She's sounding the bell. 
- Father! 
- Bastian! 
Take my sword. 
- ( Norick ) Get inside. 
- ( mother ) Come quickly. 
- ( Bastian ) Thank you, Father. 
- Go. 
( Grunting, Snarling ) 
( man ) Let's go, men.! 
Come on. 
A man with spirit, huh? 
( Echoing Laughter ) 
You already killed me once today, and yet, here we are again. 
- ( Groans ) 
- Run, Son! 
They're retreating. 
Zeph! 
- ( man ) They're going to higher ground.! 
- Zeph! 
I need a fourth marker for Solana. 
Nobody knows. 
We didn't find her body. 
She could have escaped. 
( Bastian ) He's right, Farmer. 
I've been looking for you. 
I've been busy. 
( Door Closes ) 
- We had an agreement. 
I gave you access to my castle so that we might work together. 
And I'm keeping my end. 
I'm sure recent events demonstrate how very busy I've been. 
Yes, indeed. 
You have managed to stir things up a bit. 
Stir things up? 
What do you know of a man they call Farmer? 
( Chattering ) 
( King ) People of Stonebridge. 
The armies of Ehb sympathize with you. 
This great tragedy will be avenged. Where were the king's army when the Krug came killing? 
Peasant, do not forget to whom you speak. 
In your world, don't you bow before your king? 
In my world, the king's army's expected to protect the kingdom. 
- ( Woman Weeping ) 
What of those taken by the Krug? - Krug taking prisoners? 
If these Krug have taken prisoners... it is not yet clear what their purpose might be. 
( man ) The king's army will require every man capable of combat. - ( Tarish ) Who is with us? - ( Woman ) What will happen? 
The king has his armies and his walls. 
Those taken by the Krug only have us. 
- ( Tarish ) You dare defy your king's wishes? - I'm with you, Farmer. 
- Guards! 
- ( King ) Let them go. 
That is not the way of Ehb. 
- No more risk than you. - I have no choice. 
She's my wife. 
- She's my sister. 
All right, let's get to it. 
Go with the armies to Ehb. 
You wanted the life of a soldier, didn't you? 
Nah. 
I didn't like the uniforms. 
- Do you have a horse? - A mare. 
She's old, but still strong. 
Old... but still strong. 
We have met before, have we not? 
Tell me how you love me. 
( Farmer's Voice ) you know. 
- I've heard of you. 
Children's stories about magic. 
Yeah, well, my son needed me. 
I failed him. 
Now my wife needs me, if she lives. 
Does it occur to you, Farmer... that there may be events of greater importance... than the loves and losses of our particular lives? 
Doesn't occur to me. 
Try to stay alive, Farmer. 
Your king needs you. 
Far more than he understands. 
( Norick ) How did you know about this bridge? 
( Farmer ) As a child I roamed around these parts. 
It's how I spent my days. 
- What are you thinking? 
We can cross it. 
Let's take the gear off the horses. 
What, do you mean we're leaving' em, just like that? 
Are you afraid we're gonna hurt their feelings? 
- Get out of here. 
Let's do it. 
- You're a brave old guy. 
I just don't want you weakening the rope before I've had my turn. 
You were more concerned about your horse. 
It's you I'm not so sure about. 
Well, wait till you get to know me better. 
( Yells ) 
That saved us a lot of time. 
- ( Tarish ) Get on your feet, soldier. 
( King ) How many men on guard here? 
I am on guard, my king. Hmm. 
You are on guard? 
- ( Giggling ) You make my bosoms tickle. 
I'm gonna tell your mommy. 
Where are you going? 
( King ) my nephew amuses himself on the king's throne. 
Do you feel it suits you? 
you play while your king and his legions... are off on a military campaign... and your only job... is the safety of this castle - which is guarded by... no one! 
Your Majesty... was off investigating outlandish claims. 
- Get him out of my sight. - No! 
( Tarish ) Go on, before I make you. 
You are not fit to kiss my gown. 
And you-You are not fit to tarnish your uncle's crown. 
Unless the king specifically orders it... you cannot touch me. 
Imperial law... is a toy... 
I shall never tire of. 
- Things are progressing according to plan. - I cannot wait any longer! 
I cannot stand the suffering rule of that senile goat. 
Make it happen. 
Fine! 
We shall accelerate. 
Good. 
Must you always appear suddenly from nowhere? 
I don't. 
I appear so suddenly from somewhere. 
You assume too much entering my chambers unbidden. 
I'm not welcome to the hospitality you've offered in the past? 
You're not welcome to come and go as you please... and then vanish without a word. 
I'm not your harlot. How could you think such a thing? 
you know very well why I must appear so quietly. 
I can't very well be pounding on milady's door, now, can I? 
How do you come and go as you please... when you're considered by my father to be an enemy of the king? 
I have friends. 
I wield influence. 
Why does my father despise you so? 
He's not known for his hasty opinions. 
Questions! I did not come here to be interrogated. 
your father hates me because I will not bow and scrape... before the almighty king and his magus. 
Because I will take from him what I please - 
Even his daughter's virtue. 
( Whispering ) Begone from my chambers. - Begone from my life. 
- ( Chuckles ) 
And after all the work we've done. 
Haven't I helped you discover your power, your vision? 
- You've introduced me to parlor tricks and nightmares. 
Please. Please. 
Again allow me to offer my deepest apologies... for mistaking your orders. A mistake? 
- Is that what it was? 
- Yes. 
Hmm. 
May I sit, Your Majesty? 
Boy! 
- Go. 
I know I have failed your trust on several occasions... and perhaps I may be a disappointment to you... and the entire kingdom, but I will change. 
I will shed this youthful folly in this time of great battle... and I will prove myself a worthy heir. 
Eat. 
You show a knack, my nephew... for well-timed diplomacy. 
I guess that's something. May I offer a toast? 
Possibly. 
Drinking wine in the morning is not a good way... to show... reform. 
Indeed. Yes, indeed. 
( Chuckles ) Yes. 
( man ) The Krug last attacked Stonebridge, in the south. 
( Tarish ) yes, and this harsh terrain... will drive them north, around the marsh. 
Then we should attack. 
That is, if the Krug behave the way they're supposed to behave. 
Nobody goes into Sedgwick Forest. 
( Farmer ) The forest passes between the mountains. 
We'll come out at Slate Pass as the Krugs arrive. 
You don't just cut through it when you please. 
you don't wanna be stuck here at night. 
- We'll light torches. - Torches attract eyes. 
- Let' em look. 
- Farmer! 
You know what people say. 
There are... things in Sedgwick Forest. People say God watches over the innocent. 
People say a lot of things that won't help us now, Norick. 
We've got a lot of ground to cover. 
- There is no path. 
- So how do we know where we're going? 
( Whispering ) Wait. 
( Bastian ) You were right, Norick. 
Is this part of the plan, Farmer? 
- When I'm ready. 
We hate your weapons and your killing. 
- Then pass through... and never come back. - We're passing through, that's all. 
( Both Yelling ) 
We're, uh-We're lost. men 
- Not only useless, but helpless as well. 
I beg of you news of my father. - Your father has gone on an errand for his king. 
- Please - 
What's happening? 
I worry that he's in grave danger. 
What he does not need is a daughter... who's troubling herself with the affairs of men. 
My father thinks that keeping me locked in this castle will ease my mind. He's wrong. I know the mood of this court. 
It's never been more troubled. 
Darkness threatens... our empire. Darkness that's spawned by magic. Come on! 
your father seeks reason... 
- and remedy. - Your Majesty? Your Majesty? 
- Your father - 
- Your Majesty! 
Gallian.! 
I feel like I'm dying. 
Did you dine well with the king? 
- ( Chuckling ) 
I thought you were in a hurry to accelerate things. 
( Groans ) 
You've poisoned me. You've killed me. 
- Don't be so melodramatic. 
- ( Groans ) 
It's nothing that can't be fixed. 
Please. Please! 
( Chuckles ) 
Let us hope you remember who has the real power here. Yes. 
Now what shall you do for me? 
Can he be saved? 
Perhaps, if it's not too late. 
On my soul. 
A word in private. 
Fallow has fled the castle... and he's taken two full legions with him. 
( merick ) Well, that tells us who poisoned the king. 
Prepare to move to the north, where we shall meet our new allies. 
The strength of our combined armies... shall allow for generations of peace and tranquillity. 
Why has Commander Tarish not briefed us for this mission? 
Anyone else care to commit treason? - How much of the army remains? 
Hmm. 
Well, I have seen the Krug massing. Gallian is raising armies vast armies. 
- How? 
How is that possible-That a single man can cause so much devastation? 
My own daughter betraying me to my sworn enemy. 
- Do you hate me that much? - ( Moans ) 
I thought that I loved him. He has tapped into our bloodline. 
You have tilted the balance of magic in his favor. 
Thanks to you, the kingdom may be lost. 
I'm sorry. 
( Weeping ) I'm sorry. 
I'm so sorry. 
You hate each other. 
Why shouldn't we hate you too? 
We stay in the forest to avoid your wars and your contests... and your mindless enterprise. 
And yet, here you are, shooting your arrows into our trees. 
Harm is but a way oflife for your people. 
The fact that you don't realize it is what makes you so dangerous. 
Good luck. 
( Muttering, Grunting ) 
( Norick ) Do we have a plan? 
( King ) yes, I'm awake. 
You'll find it's not so easy to kill a king. 
But, Your Majesty, you have been poisoned. 
- Perhaps you haven't your bearings. - I have my bearings, Commander. 
And I have my wits. 
The Krugs do not expect us to attack, so that's exactly what we will do. 
Who poisoned me? 
I believe it was your nephew, Duke Fallow. 
He has abandoned the castle... taken the guard and the 1 1 th and 1 2th legions. 
We will attack. 
First light. Summon your troops. 
How much time do I have? 
Your life is coming to a close... but there is time enough. 
( Thunder Rumbling ) 
Not at all. 
- ( Woman, Indistinct ) - Shh! 
She's here, Norick. - I can feel it. 
- I think you're right. 
Easy. 
Solana! 
( Grunts ) 
Today... we ride for our king. 
And our king proudly fights... 
- ( Cheering ) 
Your Majesty. 
God blesses those who die for honor and truth.! 
( Cheering ) 
I'm curious about you, Farmer. I sense danger in you. 
I can't read you. 
I can read most men, like reading scrolls of flesh. 
But you - you, I can't see past your scowl. 
Why is that? 
Some riddles aren't worth solving. 
( Grunts ) 
I thought it a nightmare. 
Bastian, where is Zeph? 
Is he with our parents? 
He's with them, but... he didn't make it. 
He... was killed with them the day you were taken. 
I'm sorry. 
( Sobbing ) My baby. Did he die quickly? 
Tell me. 
He died quickly. 
Farmer will come. He'll find you. 
( Solana ) How do you know? 
( Norick ) Because he must. 
Because he needs you. 
At the end of the day, you're all he really needs. 
Much for you to do. 
( Grunts ) Not looking too good, are you? 
Try a bit of this. 
( Gagging ) 
( Laughing ) That's medicine. 
Come on. 
( man, Indistinct ) - ( Woman ) No.! 
It's good to be home. 
( merick's Voice ) He has used you to destroy - ( Gallian's Voice ) I know that poets claim - 
( merick ) He bends emotion for sport. 
Have you learned nothing? 
( Gallian ) Haven't I helped you discover your power, your vision? 
My lady? 
I've jeopardized everything. 
But your father has nothing but love for you. 
My girlish stupidity has damaged him. 
Taking your life would damage him further. 
Perhaps you're right. 
I would like my father to be proud of me. He already is. 
He's proud of an idea of me. 
These are Krug. 
( Fallow ) Obedient, relentless and unquestioning. 
What you see before you is a powerful army. 
Put him in the king's tent. See that my horse is well fed. 
Hold. 
So was this your urgent errand? 
- It is. 
- ( Exhales ) 
Now why does a disloyal dirt-lover from Stonebridge... command such careful attention from the king's magus? Because the king has a special interest in this... dirt-lover. 
I know nothing of this interest. 
Neither does the king. 
I thought it was about time that you two were properly introduced. 
We've met. 
But the last time, he turned his back on me. 
Turned to what needed doing. 
I thought Your Majesty would be interested in this farmer. 
He's been through a great deal since we met him in Stonebridge. 
So has everyone else. 
What makes him so special? 
Because, Your Majesty... he is your son. 
Norick tended the queen's horses. 
I recognized him when we were in Stonebridge. 
After the massacre at Oxley Pass, this Norick... found a boy about three years of age wandering in the battlefiield. 
There was only one boy at Oxley Pass. 
What do you think of this tale, Farmer? 
One old man thinks he recognizes another from 30 years ago. 
That's how you determine who's king? 
You are the king's son, and heir to the throne. 
I have no father - 
No parents. 
I have no business here. 
Are you telling me that that arrogant bastard is my son? 
He spent the last 30 years... living over a Stonebridge farm? 
It would appear so. You told me he was dead.! 
You said they were all dead! 
What kind of joke... do the gods play on me? 
Sometimes the gods know what is best for us. 
What the hell does that mean? 
You remember the chaos we were in? Hmm? War everywhere. 
Surrounded by enemies. 
If that child had been taken back to Castle Ehb... how long would he have survived? 
Growing up in Stonebridge... he grew up strong... and far away from the enemies... who would have jumped at any opportunity... to rid you of your son and heir. 
Dear friend... you better be right about him. 
You better be sure. 
- That's not my problem. - His kingdom is threatened. 
Your kingdom is threatened. 
I don't know this king. 
Solana's my family. 
Norick and Bastian. 
They are my family. 
And where will you live? Hmm? 
When the kingdom falls to Gallian... what future will you be able to offer your wife? 
Think about it. 
We offer no quarter here. 
And anyone who follows under your command... will likewise be considered as a defector. We will spare no traitor. 
( Fallow ) Gentlemen... 
Commander Tarish has poisoned the king... and accuses me of treason. 
Your ambition has no limits, Tarish. 
The Kingdom of Ehb is now subject to my rule. 
We, as well, offer no quarters. 
You will never be king, my nephew... because you have no valor - 
Not now, not ever. 
The 1 1 th and 1 2th legions are with you, Your Majesty. 
( Fallow ) You coward! 
( Tarish ) These Krug have no archers, but they also have no fear. 
Now, they outnumber us, but we are men... 
- and we serve a noble kingdom. - ( Troops Cheer ) They are beasts, with bloodlust. 
Nothing more. 
( Cheering ) 
So, have you come to do your duty? I've decided to fight. 
I'll be proud to have you fight by my side so that I might keep an eye on you. 
( Clicks Tongue ) 
Mid guard. 
Lead out. 
Archers. 
Fire! 
Fire! 
( Shouts ) 
( Horse Whinnies ) 
- ( Whinnies ) 
Men, move out. 
Yes, sire. 
( All Shouting ) 
Let's go. 
Ready. 
Fire! 
( All Groaning ) 
These Krug fight mindlessly. 
Their minds belong to those. 
We will win more than a day! You have killed these. 
I will simply beckon more. 
( Grunts ) 
Christwind. Is this where we pay for our sins? 
No, Norick. 
This is where we pay for our virtues. 
Sins are more than welcome here. 
Whoa. 
The king. 
Hold still, good uncle. 
( All Shouting ) 
Quickly. 
Get the king off the fileid. 
( man ) Come on. 
- Ride. 
- ( Grunts ) 
( All Grunting ) 
We're already like them. We're slaves. 
- I won't live like a slave. 
- Norick, be still. 
( Grunts ) 
We shall cut though the forest to Castle Ehb. 
With no armies and no guard, the castle is ours for the taking. 
Whoa. 
Let's get out of this place. 
Ho, ho, ho. Ho. Oh, ho, ho. 
Lookee here. 
A friend of the family. How delightful. 
Alone in the forest does not make you feel vulnerable? 
- Keep your distance. - You never did trust me, did you, Muriella? 
Your comportment has never earned trust. 
Comportment? Decorum? 
Those are words for a castle. 
We-We are no longer in a castle. 
- There are no rules here. 
- ( Horse Whinnies ) 
( All Groaning ) 
( Gasps ) No. 
( Grunts ) Hyah. 
Hyah. 
( Grunting ) 
- ( Grunts ) 
There are rules everywhere, my duke. 
Your talent for breaking them has failed you at last. 
- I'm taking this one with me. 
- ( Grunting ) 
I'll find you! 
Go! 
- ( Sword Clangs ) 
What you always wanted - a courageous death. 
Ah, you were a brave old guy. 
( Solana ) Bastian? 
( Gasps ) 
- ( Shouting ) 
- Stay back. 
- ( Chattering ) 
You fought well today. Slaying beasts... 
- can be a cruel courage. 
- Yes. 
Whatever presents itself... 
- you'll do it. - I'm used to hard work. ( Chuckles ) 
Well, that'll come in handy... when you're king. 
How do you suppose it is that you... fought so well today? 
I mean, was it... luck? 
you have qualities, you know. Leadership. And, of course... you speak your mind. 
This will serve you well. 
Wisdom is our hammer. 
Prudence will be our nail. 
When men build... lives... from honest toil - 
Courage never fails. 
Where did you hear that? 
I told it to my son... every night... when he was a little boy. 
And no one else. 
Things are gonna be a lot harder for you from now on. 
- I'm a simple farmer. - yes, yes. 
- You know, there's that little village... not too far from here. 
They raise two crops a year. - That would kill the soil. 
- No. 
It does not kill the soil because of the seaweed. 
You see, the seaweed comes in from the ocean... and enriches the soil. 
You should try that. 
How do you know these things? 
Because I am king. 
Because I'm expected to know... about the land. Just as you will be. 
As long as there are kings... as long as there is land... they will fight over it. 
Battles fought for barren lands. 
What are these wars if they never end? 
And they fought for peace. 
Peace - that's a dream. 
A dream that maybe you... as king... can bring peace forever. 
You don't understand. 
These battles have robbed me of my child. 
You forget they robbed me of mine. 
My son. 
Yes, sir. 
Take a scout to the north side of the woods. 
- We should know what's waiting for us. 
- Aye, sir. 
Look. 
( Tarish ) Well, now this... is a surprising delivery. 
Duke Fallow's here to meet justice. 
I assume the king lives. 
General Backler... give this man your sword. 
No armor. 
How lovely. 
You remember what I did to you as boys, don't you, Tarish? 
Can I at least have a lick of wine? 
Will no man help his king with his armor? 
Pigs. 
This duel - it will be your last, Fallow. 
( Tarish ) I should kill you. I should kill you. 
( man ) The king is dead.! 
King Konreid has died.! 
No. 
No, this cannot be. 
I am your king. 
- No, you are a curse to the throne! 
- Commander Tarish... is bound by honor. 
He'll never kill the new king of Ehb. 
( Groans ) ( Laughing ) ( Sighs ) 
Coward. 
My subjects of Ehb! 
Long live the king! 
Hip, hip, huzzah! 
Hip, hip, huzzah. 
( merick ) Citizens of Ehb. 
Soldiers of Ehb. 
A few moments ago... our beloved King Konreid passed away. 
- ( man ) No.! 
- Murdered by his nephew... who sought to take his place. 
By the laws of our land... the king's successor must be related to him by blood. 
I give you your new king... the lost son of Konreid... 
Camden Konreid... known to some of you as Farmer. 
On your feet, please. 
Stand up. 
The king called upon you to face death. 
Those still standing have cheated death of its prize. But our enemy still lives. 
He'll rebuild his forces and launch a renewed assault. 
Tonight we dress our wounds... bury our dead. 
Tomorrow we march on Christwind hold. - Gouge evil from its shell. 
- ( man ) Gouge evil from its shell.! 
God save the king! 
( All Cheering ) 
Take them with the others.! 
Wait. 
Bring her over here. 
Begone. 
I sense him... in you. 
The farmer. 
- And I will be expecting him. 
- I'm nothing to you. 
Yes, but he is something to me. 
More than a farmer. 
Now he'll come to me. 
How? 
( Whispers ) Don't move. Don't move. 
I feel him... in you. 
Because you're carrying... his son. 
You're carrying his son. 
Gloucern. 
They took me from my home. 
We'll get you back home. 
We'll die here. 
Good-bye, old friend. 
Where the broadsword fails, the dagger may succeed. 
No time for riddles, magus. 
A small force might slip through the Krug lines... and solve the problem at its source. 
Get me to this Gallian... and I'll kill him. 
Sir, with respect... are we making plans to save one woman when there is an entire kingdom at risk? 
If the king is to save his wife, he must kill Gallian. 
If he kills Gallian, the kingdom is saved. 
Muriella. 
Now is the time. 
I wish to join your mission. I wish to be of service. 
Yes. Well, you've made your point. 
I am my father's daughter... and I will serve the king just as he does. 
You brought the king's murderer. He fell into my hands. 
A man needs all the help he can get, magus. 
I accept your offer. 
- Which others? 
( muriella ) Let me show you. 
- You've managed to stay alive. 
Those who you fight, those who control the Krug - we will help you fight them. 
Thought you didn't involve yourself in the conflicts of men. 
This war isn't going away. We can see that. 
And when our forest is burned and invaded... we have no other choice. 
We will fight with you, and then we wish to be left alone. 
Christwind. - Built as a secure haven for magi. - How secure? 
Well, the doors open from within. 
You can get in? 
- A magus does not need doorways to enter Christwind. 
- I'll find a way. 
Do you consider yourself lucky to be alive? 
Life... has never been so exciting. 
Those people who came with me - Why not free them? 
You do not want the world to know that you have ultimate power and mercy? 
Do you understand nothing? 
I'm beyond good and bad. 
These are childish ideas. 
I'm changing the structures of the world. 
Where would I stop if I showed your friends mercy? 
- It could - - No exemptions! 
No one. 
Not you. Not the farmer. 
Not your poor screaming boy whose insides I tore out. 
Kill me! 
I enjoy you. 
If you can bleed, you can die. 
Perhaps I can. 
( Whispers ) But I won't. 
I have too much work to do. 
Archers ready. 
Fire! 
Now! 
There is a cave up there. It allows the air to enter. 
And now I must leave you. 
I don't want you to go alone. 
If there is any sanity left in that madman, then I must try to reach it. 
But I should at least be able to distract him. 
I knew you'd come. Old friend. 
But you have greatly changed. 
Oh? 
A magus's power is contingent... on his service to a king. How is it that you thrive as the king's adversary? 
How do you like my Krug? 
- They are a cruel abomination. 
- ( Laughs ) 
They have no king. 
So guess what I've done, old friend. 
- I dare not guess. - I've made myselfking. 
King of the Krug. 
Now I serve a king who deserves my utmost devotion. 
- Me. - Enough! 
Gallian, you and I are the last of the magi. 
I beg you, recognize that you have fallen into madness. 
You have no idea... how powerful... madness can be. 
In my kingdom, there will be no word for madness. We shall simply call it... 
- power. - ( Groaning ) 
( All Shouting ) 
He's arrived. 
I see no reason to prolong this battle. 
( Groaning Softly ) Muriella. 
Muriella. 
I don't know how it happened. 
How could I have been so stupid? 
Forgive me... magus. 
Take the last of my power. 
- ( man ) Kill them.! 
- ( Shouting ) - ( Grunts ) ( Grunts ) 
( man ) Look out behind you.! 
Run! 
Go! 
Move it. Let's go. 
Go! 
This way. 
( Chattering ) 
( Solana ) Farmer. 
- ( Gasps ) - you've caused me a lot of worry, Farmer. 
We can't have two kings bickering over a single kingdom, now, can we? 
How often do two kings get to do battle one-on-one... getting to taste the blood of one's true enemy? 
Are you gonna fight... 
or talk me to death? 
( Groans ) 
- Where's your honor? 
- ( Laughs ) 
I will have my vengeance. 
What manner of vengeance are you enjoying, Farmer? 
The vengeance of a father, the vengeance of a husband... or the vengeance of a king? 
- You forget the vengeance of a mother. - ( Groans ) 
What's happening? 
There's something I've always wanted to tell you. I love you. 
( Folk Rock )

Welcome to the California Gold Coast! 
A magical land where the sun always shines and the surf always rolls. 
A place where $ 1 million might buy you a view of another guy's view. 
Once upon a time this was the home of the legendary Bobby Z. 
You see that out there, folks? 
That's Bobby Z's territory, my friends. 
He ruled those waters. 
He was Poseidon. 
He was Neptune. 
His heart beat with the rhythm of those waves. 
And when the sun set, Z blessed this land with the most amazing weed known to man! 
In those days, if five yuppies smoked a bowl after their poached salmon, well, it was Z's weed, guaranteed. 
Z's gone now. 
Six years, maybe more. 
Some say he's in Europe. 
Some say even Thailand, maybe Japan. 
And the doubters, the non-believers, they all say," Of course, he's dead." 
But he's coming back. 
I know it. 
Water is life. 
From it he sprang and to it he shall return! 
Bobby Z is gonna be rebirthed. 
Bobby Z is gonna be resurrected. 
He's coming back. 
The great Bobby Z is coming back! 
This guy's perfect. 
His name is Tim Kearney, three-time loser from Palmdale. 
There's definitely a resemblance. 
- Family? 
- Mom's dead, Dad split. 
Uncles, aunts, brothers, sisters? 
Tim's an only child, on his own since he was 15. 
First gets busted, when he was a kid, for breaking and entering when he trips over a lawn sprinkler on the way out the door, carrying his stash. 
Goes to juvie, comes out, does it again. 
Right? This time, he gets a court-mandated stint in the Marines. 
Gets his ass sent to Iraq. All right? 
Well, he wins the Navy Cross, and then gets a dishonorable discharge. 
- For what? 
- Beating up an Iraqi colonel. 
Should have given him a medal. 
So he comes back to the States, where he commits assault and battery, strong-arm, on a convenience store clerk, for raising the price on an ice cream bar. 
- I thought it was 85 cents. 
- $ 1.15. 
Strike one. 
And now, get this, he gets paroled. 
His dipshit buddy, Wayne, picks him up. 
On the way home, they stop at a gas station. 
Tim's waiting in the car, Wayne goes in. 
Okay? He was a dupe. Wayne robs the gas station. 
Open the door! Go! 
Oh, shit, there's a cop! 
There's a cop! Open the door! Go, man! 
Strike two. 
Which leads us to our dead biker friend, Mad Dog. 
Been here six months now, boy. 
You need protection and we're it. 
- Just wanna do my time, man. 
- Don't work like that, soldier boy. 
Strike three. 
- Heartbreaking. 
Yeah, he's fucked. 
Brotherhood will get him no matter what prison yard he ends up on. 
Shit, the Brotherhood will kill you no matter where you end up, period. 
How'd you get to be such a loser, convict? 
What is it, low self-esteem? 
Lack of impulse control? 
Man, I can't remember what they decided. 
Well, I see you had a lot of practice from your file here. 
Yeah. You know why you're here? 
Probably' cause you want me to roll over on somebody, right? 
Wrong, we don't want you to roll over on somebody. 
We want you to be somebody. 
That's what my mom used to say. 
Now, why don't you stop fooling around? 
And maybe, just maybe, if you do like I say you do, you can walk away from here and keep walking. 
Would you like that, convict? 
Good. 
Look at him. 
Look at him! 
Who does he look like? 
- Does he look like anybody you know? 
- Well, he kind of looks like me. 
You know who that is? 
That is Bobby Z. 
Robert James Zacharias, man. 
He grew up in Laguna Beach. 
While you were shitting your life down the toilet, he was the dude. 
- The man. 
- Oh, he had it all, man. 
The hottest women, the finest clothes, the best dope. 
He was living the life, man. 
But he had another talent. 
See, Bobby was also a very accomplished drug dealer. 
Matter of fact, he was a legend at 16. 
Couldn't even get a driver's license. 
He hitchhiked to and from his first weed buy. 
Two Nike bags, 8 ki's of Maui Wowee. 
Z turns two gym bags into four, four into 16, 16 into 32. 
Unlike you, convict, he figures it all out. 
'Cause he never puts his own ass on the line. 
But he's getting some unwanted attention, not from the cops but from some other businessmen, some rivals. 
Two of his best runners end up face-down in a drainage ditch out there in Riverside. 
So what does Z do? 
He disappears like the morning mist. 
Now the dope still keeps coming. 
And we're wondering how. 
Turns out Bobby Z's got a marketing system. 
Yeah, it's genius. 
Cutouts, bonuses, agents. 
Profit-sharing. 
All kinds of shit. 
I mean, he's bringing in boatloads of the best weed from all over the world. 
Bringing it in electronically, running his empire from afar, like he's a goddamn wizard of weed or some shit. 
So, what do you want me to do? 
Don Huertero. 
Biggest drug dealer in northern Mexico. 
Runs Tijuana, runs Baja, runs San Diego. 
He wants to partner up with Bobby Z and start marching north to Los Angeles. 
Now, this Don Huertero is holding a man in Mexico. 
His name is Art Moreno. 
He's a good man. 
He's got five kids, and I'm godfather to all of them. 
I'd like to see my partner come home alive. 
Don Huertero has agreed to make an exchange, 
Art Moreno for Bobby Z, but only for Bobby Z. 
- So why don't you find him? 
- We had him. 
Turned himself in in the embassy in Thailand, sick as a dog. 
Got bit by some Asian bug. 
Walks in to the embassy, says his name is Robert James Zacharias, says he's dying, says he needs to speak with somebody. 
So I'm on a plane, pronto. 
But I'm too late. 
Kaboom, heart attack. 
Drops dead right there in the embassy. 
Goddamn bug killed him. 
So listen up. 
This is where you come in. 
Look, Don Huertero's got no sense of humor about this shit. 
If he finds out that the real Z is dead, he will kill my partner. 
Dead for dead. 
You pretend to be Z. 
We make the trade with you at the border, and if you walk away, well, you walk away. 
Man, the second I walk in there, 
Don Huertero's gonna know I'm not Bobby Z. 
Huertero and Z have never met. 
It's up to you. 
You take your chances on the border, pretending to be Bobby Z, or we leave you here at the Hotel California. 
- Perfect. 
- I'll be damned. 
- Tell me how you got that scar again. 
I... I was surfing and my head bounced off a rock when I wiped out. 
- Where? 
- Three Arch Bay. 
- What kind of car do you drive? 
- A' 66 Mustang. 
- Favorite color? 
- Yellow. 
- Favorite football team? 
- He hates football. 
- I hate football. 
- I hate football. 
Favorite meal? 
Come on! 
Vegetarian chili. 
How many times we gotta go over this? 
Lunchtime, Z. 
- Chew up. - Come on, man, can I get some real food, 
- like a cheeseburger or something? 
And a leftie. 
You make one mistake like that with Don Huertero, you're a dead man, okay? 
- Remember her? 
- That's Audrey. No. 
Not Audrey, Olivia! 
Elizabeth. 
Oh, yeah, you remember her name, don't you? 
How long was I with her for? 
I don't know. 
I thought you guys knew everything. 
Why would I wanna be with anybody else? 
Shut up and get up. 
Wait, one last thing. 
If Huertero mentions the Monk, he was your chief of operations. 
The Monk? 
You're just telling me about this now? 
- They won't ask you. 
- In case it comes up, he should know. 
You guys went to high school together. 
The Monk went to Notre Dame, then joined a Franciscan order. 
He has some serious math skills. 
Started putting the monastery's books on Quicken. 
Fell in love with the Internet. 
Discovered he loved it more than he loved God. 
So he quits the Church, helps you make your business electronic. 
Without the Monk, Z wouldn't be Z. 
Here's the Monk's number and address, in case you need it. 
You got another vest for me? 
Hey, you just relax. 
I sent that recommendation for your promotion upstairs, Escobar. 
- I wanna get your partner back for you, sir. 
Let's go. 
Good luck. 
Okay, cowboy. 
Don't shoot! 
Don't shoot! 
Don't move. 
No, dear God, don't shoot. 
Shut up! Shut up! 
Clear the tracks! 
Señor Z? 
That's me. 
Mr. Z? 
Mr. Z? 
I brought you clothes. 
The bathroom's right there. 
I brought you a new toothbrush. 
Gracias. 
Mr. Z? 
Mr. Z? Hi. 
Mr. Brian would like to see you right now, if it's convenient. 
- Come on. 
- Sure. 
Hey, the legend that is Bobby Z. 
Well, it's an honor, my friend. 
- Brian. Brian Cervier. 
- Good to see you. 
Well, welcome to my humble abode. 
Get him a glass of wine. 
Squeezed from my own grapes. 
Don Huertero apologizes for not being here to greet you personally, but he'll be up over the weekend, so until then you just chill and enjoy the oasis. 
Bobby Z. 
Bobby Z! 
At my hacienda. 
Who'd have thought? 
A hundred acres of vineyards, dating back to the 1500s. 
So, what happened out there last night? 
Cops started shooting, man, so I hit the dirt. 
It's a dangerous place, the border. 
Get some towels. 
So, what are your plans? 
- Man, I don't make plans. 
Just... - Really? 
I'm only asking because Don Huertero has a proposition for you. 
A serious one. 
Well, then, I'll talk about that with the don when he gets here. 
- Well, I won't take that as an insult. 
- Don't. 
Now, this is a beauty. 
A horse in England called Great Run, won the National a couple of times. 
And this, this is its foal. 
Unfortunately, it broke its leg. 
It's fucking useless, and I haven't got the heart to shoot it. 
This is my most valuable product. 
You got connections in Thailand, right? 
Thais. I get a lot of money for Thais. 
Give you massage and then cook you a nice green chicken curry afterwards. 
- Hurry up. 
- Hey, hey, what are you doing? 
Dumbo, don't bruise the fruit. 
It's a product. 
If you bruise it, then no one will want it, okay? 
Bill, just get your men in order, will you? 
You give me some decent money to pay for help, 
I wouldn't have morons working for me. 
Right. So. 
Massage parlor. Massage parlor. 
Massage parlor. 
You, massage parlor. 
These ugly ones over here, send them to the sweatshop. 
And this, this is Bobby Z. 
- Pleasure. 
- Likewise. 
Used to herd cattle. 
Jules, wait a minute. 
Who are these people? 
You know, Eurotrash, crazy Russians, friends from the import-export business. 
And, of course, the lovely Elizabeth. 
I trust you slept well? 
- Yeah. 
- And alone. 
Is that... Is that her boy? 
Oh, no, that's Olivia's beautiful, beautiful boy. 
- Where is Olivia? 
- She's at Betty Ford. 
This time for speed. 
She asked Elizabeth to look after the kid six months ago. 
Mr. Brian. 
Your gear. 
Shut up. 
Oleg. 
Oleg. Come on. 
Mind your own business, bitch. 
Bobby. 
Bobby! 
He's gonna be dead in a minute. 
- Hi. 
- Hey. 
You know, Bobby, I have never seen you stick up for anyone but yourself before. 
I have to admit the kid was pretty impressed, too. 
- I don't know much about kids. 
- That's too bad' cause he's yours. 
Big, bad Boom Boom. 
- How's the meth business? 
- This is my business. 
Maybe you didn't see the sign on your way in. 
I'm a tattoo artist. 
Easy, baby. 
Don't go nowhere. 
I'm not gonna bite you. 
I got a tip for you. 
About the guy that did Mad Dog. 
Tim Kearney. 
Yeah, you and your brothers been looking for him, but you can't find him, can you? 
He'll turn up. 
The Feds still got him in protective custody. 
Oh, no. He's out. 
If I was you, I'd start looking down around the border. 
Excuse me? 
What's your play in this? 
Didn't I tell you? 
I'm the one that turned him loose. 
I could do a car bomb, take your legs off, right at the knees. 
I bet you could. 
Just' cause we doing business don't mean you got rights. 
Come on. 
Come on, please. 
What the hell do you want, Gruz? 
Let's just say Kearney being released is a case of misplaced trust. 
Drop him off in a body bag, I'll pretend it was Santa Claus, that'll be that. 
Adiós. 
So, the boy's mine? 
That's right. 
She never told me about him. 
Yeah, well, you'd have to be around for that. 
So, does everybody know? 
Just Olivia and me. 
Now you. 
Olivia asked me not to tell you. 
- So why did you? 
-' Cause you should know. 
It's been a long time, Bobby. 
- Yeah, too long. 
So, what brought you back? 
Was it the money? 
Still want my share. 
I haven't forgotten about you. 
You'll give me what's mine? 
Yeah, of course. 
You really have changed, Bobby. 
How? 
Well, in the old days, you would have definitely had me in bed by now. 
Let's do it my way. 
You haven't forgotten my favorite position, have you? 
- No. 
- No? 
Do you remember our first time? 
In my old trailer at El Morro Beach? 
It's still there, if you need it. 
Thanks. 
Noncommittal as ever. 
Was I bad to you? 
Yeah, Bobby, you were. 
You talked to Monk lately? 
No. 
You? 
Once in a while. 
He still dreams of having me someday. 
So long as that dream is alive, I'll get what I want. 
You need his number? 
No, I have it. 
You better get going. 
Why? 
'Cause when Don Huertero gets here, he's gonna kill you. 
How do you know that? 
You know Brian. Yap, yap, yap. 
Can I come with you? 
Please? 
Listen... 
- Look, go back in your bedroom. 
- Please? Can I come with you? 
- I don't know much about kids. 
- That's too bad' cause he's yours. 
Beautiful, beautiful boy. 
Where do you think you're going, son? 
I'm leaving. 
What, you gonna shoot me? 
You're not the type. 
Stop him! 
Bring him back! 
Come on! 
He's getting away! 
Get him! 
All right, get off. 
Hide. 
You came back! 
You came back! 
Yeah, I'm not too bright. 
He's heading south by southwest, Mr. Johnson. 
Let's go. 
Are we out of gas? 
Yeah, we're out of gas. 
Son of a bitch. 
All right. 
Now what? 
What are we gonna do? 
All right. 
All right, we're gonna play a game now. 
What game? 
- You know what a Marine is? 
- Kind of soldier? 
No. Marine is a bad ass. 
- You wanna play that game? 
- Why not? 
- Navy SEALs are tougher. 
Okay. 
So, we're gonna play Navy SEALs, and we're going on a secret mission. 
And we're gonna go up over that mountain over there. 
That's so gay. 
You know, the truth of the matter is, man, 
I don't really give a shit what we play right now, but if we don't play something, they're gonna shoot you... 
Don't scream at me. 
You know, forget about it. 
Let's just go. 
I was stupid. 
Let's go. 
Come on, move it. 
What, we're gonna walk? 
No, I just called for a limousine, man, it's gonna be here in 15 minutes. 
- Move out! 
- God. Crazy... 
See, you wouldn't have made a very good Marine anyhow. 
Whatever. 
Why are you doing this to me? 
We were friends. 
You've ruined everything. 
You've put my job in jeopardy. 
- Where was Bobby going? 
- I don't know. 
You know what? 
I almost believe you. 
But Don Huertero won't. 
He might. 
You know what? 
He won't. 
And it's gonna be better for me if it looks like I tried harder to find out. 
Just not my face, okay? 
What's that? 
- What? 
- Listen. 
What? 
Can you hear it? 
Run! 
Run! 
I got them, Johnson. 
They're a half a mile due west heading into Table Rock. 
Come on, go! Run! 
Run! Run! 
Come on! Stop looking! 
Don't slow down. 
Go! Go! Go! 
Come on. Go! 
They're all yours, boys. 
Bring him back alive. 
Stay out of sight. 
We're all right. 
- You miss your mom? 
- Yeah. But I like it better with Elizabeth. 
- And why's that? 
- She's not a drug addict. 
That's good. 
That's real good. 
All right, kid, I'm proud of you, but this is go-time right now. 
This is serious, and I need you to listen to me, all right? 
Those bad guys, they're right behind us. 
They're gonna be here any minute. 
So when they get here, I'm gonna signal you, and I want you to hide behind those two rocks right there. 
All right, you see those rocks? 
Okay? 
There is no way some candy-ass surfer from Laguna Beach knows his way around a desert like this. 
Shit! 
Get behind the rock. Hide behind that rock. 
I'm gonna cut you up, boy. 
Come on, cowboy. 
Come on. 
Shit. 
Come on! Go! 
Go! Go! 
Come on, go, run! 
Run, come on! 
Come on, go. Don't look back! Come on! 
- I got you now, you son of a bitch. 
Shit! 
Run your ass off. 
Come on! 
Come on, come on! 
Goddamn horse. 
I know this looks bad, but I can explain everything. 
He killed your men and escaped, even from you, Mr. Johnson. 
Let Brian cook in the sun for a while. 
Mr. Johnson, follow me. 
Brian is a cowardly degenerate who gallantly seeks to place the blame on sweet Elizabeth. 
He tells me that she warned Mr. Z about my plans for him. 
If that's true, and perhaps it is, then Brian was negligent in sharing my plans with her. 
Stand up, my dear. 
Turn around. 
The robe. 
Elizabeth, Mr. Johnson, was my late daughter's best friend. 
I've known her since she was 16 years old. 
Her beauty is a blessing and also a curse. 
Turn around, dear. 
What Brian fails to understand is that such a woman does not fear pain. 
She doesn't like pain but she does not fear it. 
- May I put the robe back on? 
- Go ahead. 
What such a woman fears is disfigurement. 
Look at this face. 
What Elizabeth fears is to be ugly. 
A deep scar from here to here, perhaps with the blade of a dull knife that no surgeon, however skilful, could repair. 
You fear ugliness. 
Am I right, Elizabeth? 
With a man such as you, Mr. Johnson, it's simpler. 
You want to live. Yes? 
Yeah. 
So, for your betrayal, and your failure, 
I sentence you to disfigurement, and you, Mr. Johnson, to death. 
But I suspend my sentence. 
You are both on parole. 
How do we get off parole, Don Huertero? 
You bring me Z, alive. 
You have three days. 
How'd his daughter die? 
She killed herself. 
Hi, fellas. 
If only you were as competent in other areas as you are with your wine, Brian. 
I cannot tolerate a man who raises his hand to a woman. 
There is just no excuse. 
No! 
How long you think that body's been there? 
Oh, two, three hours. 
- You thirsty? 
- Sí, por favor. 
Carlos. 
Don't suppose any of your men saw who dumped the body here, huh? 
They were all on their coffee break. 
This is Mexico. 
- This looks like the work of Don Huertero. - Yeah. 
That's his style. 
He's got a temper, that one. 
So, are you sure your Bobby Z was at the hacienda? 
Yeah, I think so. 
Well, maybe he's somewhere here in the dump. 
I don't think I'm that lucky. 
What if I was to find him for you? 
Well, I would appreciate that very much, Jorge. 
How much very? 
5 grand, U.S. 
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say 5? 
I meant to say 10. 
I got bosses. 
20. 
You think he made it to the mountainside? 
Well, he was a Marine. 
Big, bad Boom Boom. 
Where are you? 
We're having a wake for Mad Dog. 
What do you want? 
I want Kearney dead. 
Every day without a body costs me money. 
Now, pay attention. 
Are you listening to me, Boom Boom? 
I'm listening. 
Gruz, if you're lying to me, I'll kill you. 
Just talked to Gruz. 
Did he find Kearney? 
He says Kearney's headed for the San Diego mountains. 
I want him in pieces. 
Tiny little pieces. 
I got a beautiful package all ready for delivery. 
But there ain't gonna be much of him left. 
Do it. 
Now you're moving too fast for me, kid. 
Does it hurt? 
Go. 
Hey, good afternoon. 
What it is. 
This your place? 
Yeah? 
You... 
Excuse me, you got a first-aid kit, by chance? 
And I'd like to get one of these cabins for the night. 
60 bucks. 
What happened to your foot? 
- And this old car right here, is that yours? 
- Does it run? 
- It's all right. 
You wanna sell it? 
All right, I'm gonna get some shoes and some food and make a phone call, and I'll be right back, okay? 
You're dumping me? 
No, I'm not dumping you. 
I just don't know who's out there. 
I don't want you to be in any more jeopardy than you have to be, all right? 
I'm not scared of jeopardy. 
- What are you doing? 
Get back in the cabin. 
Do what I say and get back in the damn cabin. 
You're not the boss of me. 
- Get back in the cabin, Kit! 
- Oh, so you do know my name. 
- Of course, I know... 
- This is the first time you've ever used it. 
Shall we? 
I'm going with you! 
What grade are you in? 
I don't know. 
What do you mean you don't know? 
Well, my mom was always going back and forth across the border. 
She was either drunk or stoned, so I haven't been going to school. 
How old are you right now? 
I'm gonna be 12 the day after tomorrow. 
You have any friends? 
Do you? 
You wanna be friends? 
Maybe. 
Okay, maybe. 
- Is it okay? 
- Yeah, it'll be fine. 
I got two different size boots. 
One pair is a couple of sizes bigger than the other, so it'll work. 
- Yeah. 
- Hey, it's me. 
- Bobby. 
- Z? 
- Who the hell is this? 
- It's me. 
Where you been? 
Hey, where haven't I been? 
You sound different. 
Yeah, I am different. 
Yeah, I heard. 
Where are you? 
I'll have someone get you. 
How about... Let's meet somewhere in public. 
I can't, bro, I'm on my boat. 
I need a passport and some cash. 
- Come over to my house tomorrow at 1 : 00. 
- Yeah, that's fine. 
I'm looking for a man. 
Short hair, blue eyes, with a kid, about 11, 12 years old. 
Hadn't seen him. 
Yep, they're here. 
So, who taught you how to fight like that? 
I knew different guys who fought different styles and I just trained real hard. 
Can you teach me how to fight like you? 
Man, the best thing to do is just walk away from that stuff. 
Come on. You know. 
Guy offers me candy. 
All right, man, if somebody offers you candy, this is what you're gonna do. 
You want to square up with him as best as you can, all right? - Square up. - Yeah. 
Idea is you wanna drive this knee into his sack about as hard as you can. 
Catch him off guard. 
Yeah, right in the sack. Square with him like this and just drive it home. 
Just drive it home. 
- Like that. - Do it again, do it again, do it again. 
That's it. 
- That's it, that's perfect. 
Kit, get away from the door. 
Get away from the door, Kit! 
Get down! 
No! 
Don't kill me! 
Don't kill me! 
Don't! Don't! Please don't kill me. 
Don't you do it! 
Don't kill me, man. 
Please! Please don't kill me! 
Please don't kill me, man, please. 
Hey, give me the keys to your bike. 
What do you want? 
Girl, where you been? 
I've been trying to reach you. - Been busy. 
- Oh, they got phones in Mexico. 
Bobby's back, you know. 
- I heard. 
- I need a line on Z. 
I need to know what he's doing, what he's thinking, hear? 
- I don't even know where he is. 
- Oh, he'll find you. 
And when he does, you're gonna play it exactly like I tell you. 
You understand? 
Look. 
If I deliver Bobby, I'm off the hook. 
I never hear from you again. 
I'll be waiting for your call, sugar. 
- When did you get back? 
- This morning. 
Sorry I wasn't here. 
I was out on the boat. 
- So, who were you talking to? 
- Oh, I was just checking on Kit. 
I left him with some friends so we could be alone. 
How is he? 
He's growing up. 
You're never gonna believe who I got a call from today. 
Bobby. 
I thought he was in Thailand. 
Well, I guess he's back. 
Said he needed some cash and a passport. 
I told him to come by tomorrow, we'd work something out. 
Maybe it's time we just get out of here. 
You know, take the boat, just disappear. 
That'd be nice. 
Hey, you Bobby Z? 
Yeah, man, I am Bobby Z. 
Go big or go home. 
You want some of this, friend? 
Nice bike, man. 
- Thank you. 
- I'll take it. 
Keep that... Keep that up front for me, all right? 
You got it, I'll put it over there. 
- Enjoy the party. - Thanks. 
- Go! Go! Go! 
- Stupid shit. 
How you doing? 
- Good. - Bobby Zacharias. 
- Bobby Z? - Yeah, that's me, man. 
Yo, Tim, what's up, man? 
No, man, you got me messed up with somebody else. 
Tim, stop playing. 
It's me, Wayne, all right? 
Dude, I know this cat, man. 
- What's up? 
- I gotta talk to you over here, man. 
- What's up, man? 
- I'm Bobby Z. - You're who? 
- Man, today... 
- I'm Bobby Z today. - Oh, right. 
Oh, okay, all right. 
You Bobby Z, all right. 
Well, feel me on this. 
If you Bobby Z, I want that watch. 
The watch. 
All right. 
Nice seeing you, Bobby. 
Real nice seeing you. 
This shit real? 
Have a good time. 
Where's Kit? 
He's at your place. 
He's okay. 
So, who are you? 
How long have you known? 
Please. A woman knows who she's making love to. 
Why didn't you bust me? 
I almost did. 
Then you stuck up for Kit. 
And you're good in bed. 
Better than Bobby? 
He's dead. 
Heart attack. 
I'm sorry. 
Don't be. 
He never cared about anyone but himself. 
I'm Tim Kearney. 
Tim. 
So, are we good? 
Bobby Z. 
- Bobby Z. 
- Yeah, it's me, buddy. 
I heard you were in... 
Thailand. 
Yeah, I was. 
Cool! 
So, what was the coolest thing about that? 
- About Thailand? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Thais. 
- Where's... Where's Monk? 
- He's upstairs. 
Yeah, you know, he has a boat. 
Is it big? 
He sells great weed for cash. 
What do you think? 
He ripped off Don Huertero and blamed it on me. 
- I mean, Bobby Z. I gotta talk to him. 
- Not a good idea. 
Why, he won't believe that I'm Bobby? 
No, he's not usually that fucked up this early in the day. 
What do you want? 
Don't that look like Boom Boom's bike over there? 
Son of a bitch. 
- Kearney in there? 
- Yeah, hold on, cowboy. 
Wrong time, wrong place. 
I just wanted to let you know Kearney was here. 
Now, you be careful about how you take him out, hear? 
I don't wanna see you end up like your brother Mad Dog. 
Oh, thank you. 
Thank you for the concern, Officer. 
But Kearney ain't slitting my throat with no license plate and neither are you. 
Yeah, I heard about your young partner getting his head blown off at the border. 
- You heard about that? 
- I heard about that. 
- Terrible thing. 
You wanted to get rid of all the eyewitnesses, didn't you? 
You're a typical cop. 
No honor. No loyalty. 
You scum-sucking pig. 
Who's paying you? 
You really do have a vivid imagination, don't you, Duke? 
Yeah. I imagine that when I'm done with Kearney, 
I'm coming for you. 
Well, you come on now. 
I will be anxiously awaiting you. 
So, who's that asshole? 
Some clown pretending to be Bobby. 
That's just the kind of shit that drives Z crazy. 
Bobby's dead. 
- He is? 
So, what're we gonna do about this wannabe? 
Nothing. 
We'll be gone before it matters. 
What about Monk? 
Took care of it. 
Come on, I wanna go to the beach. 
- I need to see Kit. 
- Okay. 
Why don't you just tell Don Huertero that it was all a setup and that Bobby's dead? 
No, he wouldn't believe me. 
There's been too much spilled blood. 
Besides, I got DEA and bikers on my ass, not to mention Monk. 
I just gotta get the hell out of the damn country. 
How are you gonna do that? 
Bobby Z enemies, Bobby Z problems, I need Bobby Z cash. 
The great Bobby Z, the legend. 
Come in. 
Your son? 
Did you think you could just take my millions and get away? 
You and your friend, Monk? 
Let's go get your money. 
Doesn't involve them. Let them go. 
Let's go down to the marina right now. 
It's on the boat... 
Shut up! 
Don't try to be brave. 
You steal from me, you destroy my daughter. 
You are a pig. 
You used her like a whore and tossed her aside. 
She killed herself after that. 
Nico! 
- No! 
- Shut up! 
A child for a child. 
- He's not my kid. - Yes, I am! 
- No, he's not my kid. 
- Yes, I am! 
- He's not my kid! - You don't deserve to have a kid this brave. 
Nico! 
No, don't. 
Don't. Don't do it! 
He's your grandson! 
Look at him! 
Look at him! 
Look at his eyes! Look at his skin! 
Look at his mouth! 
Don't you see Angelica? 
She was pregnant! 
That's why she ran. 
She was afraid of you! 
She ran away to have that baby. 
And Olivia was supposed to take him, but Olivia couldn't take care of herself, so the poor kid came to me. 
And when I saw a chance for him to get away, I let him go, so he wouldn't end up like his mother! 
My grandson? 
Nico, get him inside the car. 
Wait. Wait. 
Wait. 
You let him go or I'll kill every man in this room. 
The great Bobby Z, the legend. 
No! 
Where the hell you been? 
- I'm going ape-shit in this place. 
- Whoa, partner, I've been busy. 
- You've been busy? - Yeah. 
Meanwhile, I'm stuck in this hole where room service is the Burger King on the corner. 
I'm a vegan, Gruz. 
Relax, Bobby. 
- Relax? 
- Relax. 
This place doesn't even have cable, man. 
I'm missing volleyball. 
Well, I'm so sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Zacharias, but like I say, I've been busy. 
Dealing with cops, handling the Monk. 
I got Tim Kearney out there, leaving a trail of bodies behind him like Little Johnny Stiff-seed. 
I got motorheads blowing things sky high, not to mention Don Huertero's people. 
Man, I don't give a shit about inconvenience, I don't give a shit about Don Huertero's people, or Monk, or the cops, or motorheads. 
I just care that all these guys think I'm dead. 
And you're past due, Gruz. 
- Do you want your money? 
- Oh, hell, yeah, I want my money. 
I wanna give you your money. 
But you gotta show me a body that these guys think is me, man. 
I'm working on it. 
- You're working on it. 
All you had to do was kill Kearney at the border like we planned. 
It would've been so simple. 
Look, I had him in my sights. The son of a bitch tripped. 
- What do you want me to tell you? 
- I want you to tell me Kearney is dead. 
Monk's girlfriend is taking care of it tonight. 
No shit? 
No shit. 
And she'll have Monk on the boat in the morning if you wanna settle that score. 
Did you know you had a kid? 
- No shit? 
- No shit. 
- With who? 
- Does it matter? 
Not really. 
Happy birthday. 
- Hey. You're here early. 
- I'm anxious. 
No, you mean eager. 
- Nervousness. 
- I'm anxious. 
Why? 
I've got plenty of cash. 
Going some place even Huertero can't find us. 
Huertero's dead. 
This week just keeps getting better and better. 
Wait, if Huertero's dead and Bobby's dead, why are we running? 
You're not. 
We are. 
Now, get out of here. 
Come on, man. 
Let me have my cash. 
I worked damn hard to steal that money. 
Seriously, dude, you're just gonna let me walk out of here? 
I've got everything I want. 
Definitely not Bobby Z. 
Not even close. 
- Just take care of her, would you? 
- Don't worry, he will. 
I was talking about my boat. 
- What're you doing? 
- I'm rehabilitated. 
Hey, Kearney! 
Go downstairs. - There? 
- No, go downstairs. 
- What about you? 
- I'll be right back. 
- Put it to the side! - Kearney! 
- Put it to the side! 
Go up there and get him! I'll block him off! 
- Don't move, Kearney! 
- Look, man, I'm Bobby Z. 
I don't have any beef with you guys. I don't know why you're shooting at me. 
- Look, man, I'm Bobby Z. 
- You're not Bobby Z, you're Kearney, punk. 
Shut up. 
- Would you put your gun down? 
- Shut your mouth. 
Wait a minute. 
We can work this out. 
That bitch lied to me. 
Oh, I see what the mix-up is. 
You're looking for Kearney. 
Oh, well, shit, that's him right there, in the back of the car with Gruz. 
- Hey, Kearney! 
- What'd he just say? 
He said he's you. 
God damn. 
Come on out from behind that backseat. 
Hello, Tim? 
Someone's in the backseat of that car. 
There's your friend right there. 
Get out of the car, both of you! 
Now! 
Hey, I'm sorry, Tim! 
What do we do? 
Get out of the car, do like the man says, but be cool, Bobby. 
Just be cool. 
Damn. 
That's Kearney! Oh, wait. 
Wait, wait, wait. 
- Shoot him! 
- That's Tim Kearney right there! 
- That's Kearney! - That's Kearney! 
No, I'm Bobby Z! That's Kearney! 
Shoot his ass! 
- I'm Bobby Z! 
- Oh, nice try, Tim! 
See, he's a terrible liar, so shoot him. I'm me! 
Come on, shoot him! 
That's Kearney! 
Hey, my favorite color's yellow. 
- That's Kearney right there! 
- I hate football! Gruz! 
You shut up! 
Who is this? 
I'm the real Bobby Z! 
I'm the legend! 
Dad! 
Dad! 
Jump, Dad, jump! 
Hey, son! 
Shoot him! 
- Shoot him! 
- Come on, you idiots, shoot him! 
Jump! Come on! 
Wait a minute, Kearney doesn't have any kids. 
Kearney doesn't have a kid! 
Hey, hey, don't shoot me, don't... 
I'm a federal agent, God damn it! 
Beat by a loser. 
Jump, hurry up! 
Jump! 
Jump, Dad, jump! 
Go-time, baby! 
Jump, Dad, hurry! 
And that's how Tim Kearney, a three-time loser from Palmdale, came to the Gold Coast and became Bobby Z. 
I know. I know, give me a break. 
I mean, the man is not Poseidon and he's not Neptune. 
But I'll tell you something else. 
He's got the boat, he's got the girl, and he's got a big bag full of cash! 
And down here along the Gold Coast, folks, that's what we call a legend. 
That wasn't a foul! 
Chuck! 
Chuck! Chuck! I need to talk to you! 
Hey Darla, what's the matter with you? 
You sound so upset. You slept with my twin sister on Saturday that's why I'm so upset! 
How do you know for sure it wasn't you? 
Cause I wasn't there! 
It sure looked like you were there to me. 
Ohh, he's dead! 
Come on, let's figure this out together this is a tricky situation. 
Do me a favor, say," Oh Chuck, keep buttering my biscuit". 
Get outta here. 
No, I'm trying to do detective work here so we can both be happy. 
I'm confused too! 
I feel violated. 
Chuck... keep buttering my biscuit... 
You're right, that wasn't you. 
You are such a loser Chuck! 
Let it go Darla. 
Hey look who's here. He has moved up from Marshall's to Bloomingdale's. 
He didn't even know it was you that night, Donna. 
Ha Ha, that's joke! 
He thought it was me! 
He knew it wasn't you because you would never do half the freaky stuff that we did! Tell me I don't know how to satisfy a man! 
You shut your mouth you fat ass! 
Whoa, whoa, whoa... 
Come on! 
Now don't fight you two, you're sisters give each other a kiss and make up. 
You're the only sisters you got... use your tongues. 
Dare us to? 
Unless that's too freaky for Darla over here... 
You'd be surprised just how freaky I can get. 
I'm sorry, right now you gotta prove it to me. Come forward. 
That's right. 
Say bye, the bell girls. 
Hear the bell gentleman? 
Let's go, time to make a living.

I love you, I love you! 
Oh, get me a hero... I'm starving!

So, how the kids doing? 
Oh, Tori's just great man.

Yeah, I don't think that's happening. 
Why not? 
Moo Me My Mo May... 
Eric, that's enough sit down get ready for dinner. Okay. 
Dad, you smell like smoke. 
Did you put out a fire? 
I wasn't roasting marshmallows. 
That's so cool. You're so cool. 
Oh, could you help me out Teresa and uh, just grab that spaghetti sauce out of the microwave? 
No, I have train... 
Would you please? 
I... I just need a hand 
I don't really know what I'm doing here.

Alright, you can go. 
Bowlin A's. 
Looks more like bowl of shit. 
Yeah, thanks for all your help. 
Ok guys, so... what is new? 
I'm auditioning for the school musical. Pippen. 
You uh, you like that huh? 
The uh, musical thing. 
Yeah, I love it I think it's my calling. 
That's what you said about hopscotch. 
You're just jealous cause I can do the splits. 
Isn't that supposed to hurt his testicles? 
Yes... you don't talk like that, you get back in your chair and finish your hotdog salad. 
Oh boy... 
Brownies are ready! 
Will you stop using my easy bake oven? 
But I like to bake. 
Guys will you... 
Eric why don't you watch the Met game, huh? 
... employee and planning department please tell me your name. 
Larry Valentine. 
I'm sorry I didn't quite get that. 
Larry Valentine. 
You said Barry Smalinpine is that right? 
Smalinpine? 
You said Smalinpine is that right? 
I was enunciating! 
You said I was enunciating is that right? 
Woooo! 
You said Woooo! 
is that right? Dad, you have to try my brownies, they're fabulous! 
Enough with the splits! 
Watch baseball! 
Then it took 45 minutes for this robot to stop calling me Barry... then it starts asking me if I'm calling from Gooklyn. 
Look all I'm trying to do is change my beneficiary from my wife to my kids. 
Okay, you would have to file a request to do that. 
Great. 
That's going to take awhile. 
Look lady I don't have awhile alright I'm a fireman, I could die tomorrow. 
I guess if that happened, you would be burned. 
Are you trying to make a funny? 
Sort of... anywho sir, beneficiaries can only be changed for three events, births, deaths, and marriages. 
According to our records we did contact you when your wife passed away, you had a year you should have responded. 
Oh, like a crazy person I was busy mourning the death of my wife. 
Off the record I could suggest something that's a little more simple and perhaps more fulfilling to speed things up. 
That would be great, what do you got? 
Should you remarry, your new wife at that time could be named your primary beneficiary. 
So, if there's somebody special in your life 
I mean who knows, maybe even someone you just met and you are ready to make a commitment. 
Maybe now's the time. 
Just go crazy. 
Look how pretty she is. 
Going in alive... Alright baby. 
Come on buddy. 
Levine, Valentine, can we finish this secondary search so I can get home to my wife and be denied sex. 
Yeah absolutely. 
So he's auditioning for a musical? Yeah... Pippen. 
Pippen, that ain't so bad. 
Is it about Scotty Pippen? 
I don't know, he practices singing a lot. 
Hey, Sinatra sang a lot. 
Yeah, that's true. 
Better than dancing. 
Yeah, it's just when I was his age all I did was sports, you know? 
Maybe they'll make skipping an olympic event, there's still hope. Come on man, I don't have enough problems? 
Baton swallowing, I bet he'd be great at that. 
Yeah, you're an idiot. 
I'm just busting your balls, come on. 
Ladder 223 roof, secondary search negative going upstairs. 
At least your whole pension thing's working out for you buddy. 
Yeah, hey, you know what? 
Why don't you come back down here I'll stick this pole up your ass and turn you into a lollipop. Are you talking to me or your son? 
Get down here now I'll give you an ass beating! 
I will destroy you. 
Ha ha ha ha. 
Hey Larry, good news, I found you something to eat. 
Oh cool man, I will devour that. 
You want? Alright, I'll give you a thousand bucks you eat this things head. 
For a thousand bucks, I'll start at the ass and work my way to the head. 
Aha! This I gotta see baby!

Come on! Oh! Go! 
I got it! 
We got him over here! We need a scope! 
Chuck, come on man. Heads up! 
Two members down! 
Mr. Levine, Mr. Levine? 
Do you know where you are? 
Am I in a Motley Crue video? Cause you're hot. 
Honey, how's my buddy doing? Honey? 
Uh, we're expecting a full recovery. 
And, Mr. Levine, please address me as doctor. Dr. Honey, yeah okay, you got it. 
Chuck, what's going on man? 
Brace yourself Larry, what I'm going to tell you is pretty rough. 
They removed your entire body. 
You're nothing but a head now. What? 
They said that there was enough fat in your head to rebuild you a new body, so they got scientists in the other room working on it. 
God willing, you're going to be alright. 
Oh, you know, you're such a dick. 
What's going on is you saved my life, man. 
I would have died if you didn't do what you did. Ah, would you stop being so melodramatic. 
No, I owe you... that's the code. 
Whatever you want, whenever you want it. 
Whatever, whenever. 
Whatever? 
I'll take that rat. You want to find that rat for me? 
Cause I'm hungry as hell. 
Hi Dad. Eric, Tori... hey guys, come on in. 
They called me into class and nobody would tell me for like a really long time what was wrong. 
Did you die? 
Oh, no Daddy's fine buddy. 
I could go home right now if I wanted to. 
I'm only staying here because your Uncle Chucky he's afraid to sleep alone. 
It's true Eric if he don't sleep with me then I got to sleep with Dr. Honey and you never know with Dr. Honey what kind of mood she's going to be in. 
What are you? Six years old? Ahh! 
Where you going? Come here lay down next to me! 
I'll split a vicodin with you, we'll have some fun! 
Aha! 
You little tease! 
Sweetie, what's the matter? 
Come here, it's okay. This is the same hospital, you know? 
Mom... 
I'm not going to leave you, you hear me? I'm never going to leave you. 
I'm quitting the department. 
Get outta here, man. 
No, Renaldo's cousin's got an Acura dealership down in Trenton. 
You want to sell cars? 
Acuras? I don't want to. 
But everytime I run into a fire, where's my head going to be? 
I'm all my kids got left. If I die... 
I just don't want to leave them with nothing. 
Your father was a fireman, his father was a fireman. 
You are a fireman, man. 
One of the best Brooklyn's ever seen. That's it. 
You can't do nothing else. 
Like I have any other choice. 
We'll come up with something, alright? 
Come on, I promise ya. 
Ah, poor Chuck! Hey, hey my girls are here. 
How are you? ! 
My leg hurts. How are you feeling? 
Oh God, we got different lives. 
I need some help out of here. Let's get in there. 
Hey who want to massage my ass muscle? 
Me! 
Larry! What time is it? 
It's 4 : 00. 
I saved your life, you said you owed me. 
You remember that? Yeah, you saved my life then got me out of bed at 4 in the morning. We're even now. 
Hey, look, I'm going to throw something out here and it's going to sound a little bit crazy. 
You're getting a breast reduction? 
Would you... no, shut up. No, I figured out how to solve this pension problem and I don't have to quit the department! 
Great! 
How? 
What we're going to do is we're going to set things up so that you inherit my benefits if I die. 
That way you'll be the one responsible for Eric and Tori. 
Absolutely, that's a great idea. 
How do we do that? Yeah. 
Domestic partnership. 
Domestic partnership? 
You mean like faggots? 
No, I mean yeah, but not us obviously, you know... uh, it's just on paper really. 
Paper faggots. 
Okay look, the accepted vernacular is gay, but yeah. 
I got to get something to drink. 
I'm going to have to pass. 
You can't! Why don't you pay some chick to marry you if you need this set up? 
Some chick? Like who? 
Give me the phone, I know plenty of chicks who could use the cash. 
What do you want, a blonde? 
a puerto rican? 
I'll get you a heavy girl, she'll make you feel better about yourself. 
Hey, it doesn't matter, I don't have any extra cash. 
Look man, you're the only person I can trust. 
Hey, you know who you could trust? 
Your maid. 
Teresa. 
She steals! 
She steals? Why don't you fire her? 
I'm afraid. 
I think she's into voo doo, I don't know. 
Oh God. Look this is the only way I can keep doing what I do and make sure my kids are protected. 
Larry! Look at us! 
We're not gay! 
But if we were gay, don't you think I'd be with someone a little hotter looking than you? 
I'm Mr. February for godsake. 
It would be like the prom king fooling around with a tuba player. 
Oh great, I played tuba. 
Larry, I love you, but I'm not in love with you if that makes any sense. 
Alright, do me a favor... just picture this please, alright? 
You're at my funeral and you're looking for my kids but they're not there. 
Because they're in some factor in Bangledash making sneakers for six cents an hour. 
And you go home to nail some chick you met at my gravesite and you look up and right there in your window are my kids. 
Just tapping on the glass and tears just streaming down their faces. 
You think of that and now you give me your answer. 
How would they be tapping on my window if they're in Bangledash? 
Oh my God, you're not following me here. 
I'm serious. 
Chuck, I'm thirsty, do have anything to drink? 
Yeah, there's Gatorade in the fridge. 
The girls are here... the girls, they want the Gatorade. 
Oh, they're thirsty! 
Larry, Larry watch this... Girls, actually, it's down low... the Gatorade. 
Oh, thank you... yeah. I can't be gay Larry. 
I can be a lesbian for you, but that's about it. 
I am so lonely in here. 
Hurry up Chuck. 
Dr. Honey, Dr. Honey... you know Dr. Honey. 
Yeah, I do. 
How are you feeling Mr. Valentine? 
It's still stiff when I go to the right. 
That's normal. Hey, who untied you? What? 
What? We have rules around here girls! 
Now I'm going to go Charlie Chaplin on your ass! Use the cane! 
Use it! Use it! 
Whack em, Whack em! 
A ha ha! You're just an animal, man. 
I am not an animal, I'm a whore. 
You don't want to marry the town whore. 
Believe me, you're better than that. 
What I'm talking about is no more involved than co-signing a loan or joining a gym! 
How do we know nobody's going to find out about this? 
Because privacy laws are super strict nowadays. 
Look, all we got to do is just forward your mail to my house for awhile. 
That's it! 
I don't know. 
I saved your life bitch. 
Partners? 
Partners. 
Shake on it. 
You should have let me die asshole. 
You're partners now fellas. 
Chuck. 
Chuck... 
Chuck. 
Chuck. 
Chuck. 
You got to be kidding me, they send these things blown up now? 
Is that doll for me? 
No, no, no sweetheart, it's for me... it's uh, a training doll, you know for CPR, they're testing us again, you know to make sure, you remember Daddy did the test to make sure 
the air, the passageway is clear and you... to see if they're breathing... sweetheart, go to your room please, go to your room okay? 
It's for me. 
She's fine, she's fine. 
We're dancing. 
Great to have you back Larry. 
Great to be back, Captain. 
Captain, found out what started the fire an old fashioned doobie. 
Hey brother, that's my weed. Can I get that back? You want this back? 
I can't give you it back but you know what? I got something better for you. 
Whoa, man! 
Do that again! Ha ha! He liked it. 
Looks like a powdered donut! 
Mr. Valentine? Yeah. 
Hi, I'm Glen Aldrich from the pension department. 
I'd like to talk to you about your recently filed domestic partnership. Oh! 
Hey. Are you okay? 
No, yeah, no I'm fine. That's how I always get down, it's just faster... you know, steps... 
Is your partner home? 
Uh, Mr. Charles Levine? 
Uh, no, he uh... how did you find out that we uh... 
Oh, it's standard procedure. 
You see, when a previously registered portfolio shifts over to a domestic partnership filing in the insurance log, there's an information sharing system that notifies us of the adjustment to make sure it's not a mistake. 
Were you keeping your partnership secret? 
Secret? Are you kidding me? 
! 
Hell no! 
Now we're telling everbody! It's a party! 
Telling everbody what? 
Butt out Ron! 
I hope you don't think we have any reason to doubt your situation, Mr. Valentine. 
But the sad truth is some people have used homosexual lifestyles as a cover to reap illegal benefits. 
Wow. 
Who's that? 
That's Paula, uh she's my late wife. 
So you haven't always been gay. No, I'm uh, I'm newly gay. 
When she died I knew I'd never find another woman who'd make me as happy and uh, that's when I boarded the dude train. 
Would you excuse me one second? 
Sure. 
Hey homo, did you see the moon balloons on that chick? 
They're a jiggle away from falling out. 
Chuck, don't tell me lost your key again sweetheart. What key? 
Baby! 
How about a free show? ! 
Why don't you shake them for me? 
Oh, you mean Ron, the mailman. 
Yeah, Ron you look great man, love the moon balloons shake em! 
Hey Chuck, come on in. 
This is Glen Aldrich from the penis... the pension department our pension department. 
Oh, hey. 
He uh, he knows about our partnership and uh just here checking up on us making sure we're not running a scam to collect illegal benefits. 
People do that? 
What is with the world? 
It just makes me so sad and gay to think of that kind of behavior. 
I'm going to go to my room right now and listen to Boy George records calm down. 
So, you've moved your relationship to the next level how's it been going? 
Ah great, we've just been having sex with each other all the time. 
Loads of sex. 
Gay crazy sex. 
Man on man, loving every minute of it! 
Balls and wieners all the way, right there! 
Well I won't take up anymore of your time... 
Bring the funk! 
Okay, thank you. 
So that's it? You don't have any other questions for us? 
No, that's not really how we do it. 
See if my report says I thought something was out of the ordinary then the department assigns a special investigator and he or she will just drop in from time to time unannounced. 
Over the next three or four months. 
No big deal. I'm just asking, was there anything that you saw that was out of the ordinary? 
Oh, I can't tell you that. 
Alright, have a great day. 
Wooo! Ha ha! 
Nice seeing you. Take care. 
Nice seeing you. 
We love your pants by the way, very nice! 
Are those wrinkle free? 
I think they are! They look great! They do! 
No one's going to find out about this? Oh! 
Ah! He likes it rough! 
Yeah! 
Bye bye now! Take care. You made a promise to me. 
Alright, we're going to have sex now! 
Why are we even seeing this lawyer guy? 
I just want to find out how much trouble were in here. 
Maybe it's no big deal. 
This guy will be able to tell us. 
Just give me your hand maybe we should be snuggling a little bit. 
Yeah, just a little bit like that... 
Yeah that's good, does this work too? 
Get away from me! 
Nice to meet you. 
Nice to meet you. 
Meet to nice you. 
What was that, Japanese? 
What, what are talking about? 
No, no, no I didn't do that. 
Yeah, you did say it. 
You did. 
Okay, just come on in. 
Yeah, yeah sure. 
So, my assistant says your domestic partnership is being challenged by the city. 
Not exactly challenged yet but they're definitely sniffing around. 
Home visit? 
Yeah. 
You're being targeted. 
Targeted? 
It's like an audit. 
It was a Glen somebody. 
Probably the initial interviewer but if you get a follow up from a funny little guy named Clint Fitzer, then we've got real trouble. 
Yeah, the city's really been cracking down ever since the Bensley case. 
What's that? 
In Colorado, a heterosexual government employee married his gay friend so the friend could be covered under Bensley's health insurance. 
The state found out about it, fired Bensley and prosecuted them both for fraud. 
Really? 
Oh yeah. These people needed to be made an example of. 
I mean gays and lesbians have not been fighting for these rights for forty years to be made a mockery of. 
You guys have nothing to worry about because you're a legitimate gay couple, right? 
Oh yeah, we're big time fruits. 
I used to wrestle in high school and I loved it. Okay. 
Curiosity kicking up again, what exactly did they get, the hetero bastards? 
Well Bensley got five years and his gay friend got three and a co-worker of Bensley's got 18 months. 
Why? What did he do? 
Bensley told him what was going on and he never reported it to the so he was convicted of obstructing justice and conspiracy to commit fraud. 
Pretty rough, huh? 
When I used to climb the rope in gym class I wished it was a guy. 
There is a secret weapon that really might help get these guys off your back. 
Oh great, well we love secrets. 
Yeah, we do them all the time. 
That was a key he was throwing away he likes that... 
Leave a trail. 
You know the strongest evidence for genuinely demonstrating is to take a quick drive on up to Canada and legitimize your relationship. 
Legitimize? 
Get married. 
Marry Larry? 
Alright, where do two guys get married? 
Hey, what do we got here? 
Wedding Balls. 
I do, I do love Clay Aiken. 
Great Rearendings. 
Till Dicks Do Us Part. 
Where we going to do this sweetheart? 
What's the matter you getting cold nuts? 
No, it's just Paula always wanted to go to Niagra Falls and I never got the chance to take her, you know? 
You were great to her. 
It's been three years already man, just, just... she would want you to be happy, she would want you to move on with your life find somebody new, I'm telling you. 
You know what? 
I did find somebody new and I'm marrying him today. 
Oh yeah, I'm a lucky girl. 
Queers. 
What was that? 
I said uh, tears... your love for each other brings tears to my eyes. 
That's what I thought you said buddy. 
You better watch what you say my friend. Why don't you just drive the car, you want to get beaten? 
You want a Brooklyn beating, moron, huh? 
You want to get him nuts? Smacked around? 
Then shut your mouth. 
Faggots. 
What the... bitch... 
Stupid cow. 
Sorry. 
Hey, may I help you? 
Yes, we're um... we're um... 
Gay? 
Yeah, we're uh, marrying each other. 
Gay. 
Civil or religious? 
Religious. I'm jewish, I don't want to piss my mother off. 
I'm catholic, I don't want to piss Mel Gibson off. 
Religious is more expensive, we have hire a clergyman. 
We'll just do civil then, okay? 
Will you at least wear the yamaca? 
Yeah, okay sure. 
It's important. 
Yeah I will. We want a traditional wedding too, one with a lot of photographs for evidence. 
Evidence... for our future children so they can see what a beautiful chapel this is. 
Yeah. That's nice. 
I think chebrock needs a dress, am I right? 
No that's okay. 
Come on, no? 
What size? Five times XL? 
No, no... that's fine really. 
You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to go with a tux. Like Liza Minnelli, I saw her wear one at the Oscars. 
At least have garter belts underneath, please? 
Okay. 
You will need to have a witness, we can supply one for 100 dollars. 
A hundred doll hairs? 
That's a lot of doll hairs. 
Come again? Do dolls come with that many hairs? 
I never heard that one. 
Okay, sorry, sorry... can I write that down? 
We'll get our own witness by the way so don't worry about that. 
Will you be needing a room? 
A what? 
A loom? For romantic time together. 
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa... no. We're good. 
We'll take two looms by the way. 
Yeah, we're old fashioned. 
Oh, that's very nice. 
I will give you key in case you want to sneak. That's okay, yeah. 
But I'll give you key. 
Do you have the rings? 
Yeah. 
Now the rings are a symbol of eternity because the ring, there's no beginning there is no end. 
That's kind of nice. 
It's not like a triangle, a triangle has like a corner and the ends, this one is a circle. 
Three corners. 
Please exchange the rings. 
Alright, take that. Alright, here. Thanks. 
It's a promise of your love forever together. 
Beautiful. 
For all eternity because it's a circle. 
Yes we heard about the circle, yeah. 
Yes, we're familiar with shapes. 
I now pronounce you husband and husband. 
You may kiss the husband. 
We gotta do this... What do you mean? 
We gotta do it. 
Kiss the husband. 
Yeah, we heard you. 
He's going to take a picture, we just got to do this. Oooh! 
That's how we roll in our house baby. Oh yeah. Ohhh! 
Ho, Ho... 
Do you do me? You couldn't handle it little man. 
Yeah. 
I think your witness please himself. Ahhh... 
The wire's are all in place and they have tapped all of our phones. 
Chinese government's in on it. 
And Elizabeth Taylor is big foot. 
There's a microphone in the cake. 
They moved it. He smell like a dead water buffalo. 
Oh yeah, that was jewish. 
I've been hit! 
He broke his leg. 
Hey, how come your maid ain't helping us out. She's working on something else, alright? 
Yeah, right. 
How you doing there Phil Collins? 
800 dollars... 800 dollars Bob Barker... 
She's working hard with Bob Barker. 
Hey, she doesn't like when you talk during her shows, come on. 
750, oh my balls, that's too low. 
Hey, big ragu, I smell your feet from here, I like it. 
Ohh, he thinks my feet stink. 
Now that's a stink. 
See I knew you were going to overcook this man, I told you. 
It's salisbury steak, it's supposed to be black. 
It stinks like manure. 
It's supposed to. 
I can't believe you're going to serve this to the kids... shit. 
Language! 
Kids, shit is a bad word. 
Seriously though, I am not eating this crap if I'm living here, I'm cooking. 
How long is Uncle Chuck staying? 
Just for a little bit, okay, until his apartment is fixed. 
What happened to your place? 
Uh... roaches, yeah, big giant roaches, they ate my dog. 
Bastards. 
Language! 
Shutup. 
Funny. 
Real smooth. 
What happened? 
You broke Tori's chair! 
No, no, no, it was like that when I got here I'm not kidding you, I think she did it. 
What the hell is that on your face? 
I'm exfoliating, it's good for my skin. 
That's a great idea man, in case the gay inspector comes by. 
Yeah, yeah that's why I was doing it. 
Daddy! 
Help! Tori! 
Somebody left the seat up! 
Real smooth, again. 
Why? 
What happened? 
It was like that when I got here, she... she did it. 
It's okay sweetheart, you see Uncle Chuck's not used to living in a house with a young lady. 
True that. 
Slow, slow, slow, slow... don't leave her intestines in there. 
Oh, whoa. You're father's just jealous cause he can't get his butt in that thing. 
He got his butt stuck in a king size jacuzzi one time, I seen that. Stop. 
Uncle Chuck, you left this in the kitchen. 
Hey, don't you look at that! 
I didn't! 
Know what give me that, maybe he should look at it. 
Stop it Chuck. This is an experiment, seriously. 
Eric, see how this makes you feel. 
Open it up. 
Alright, that didn't go well. 
Yo, you got any tequila in this house? 
No I don't. 
What the hell is this, you got a dog I don't know about? 
No, that's your bed. I worked hard on that. 
That ain't a bed. That's a bed, the thing you're about to cave in. 
No, look you're not sleeping here, okay? 
Nobody's slept on that side since Paula. 
But sweetheart it's our honeymoon, of course I'm sleeping in the same bed as you. 
No. 
How about if I put Paula's pajamas on, would that get me in the sack with you? 
Don't you dare touch her pj's. 
You're kidding me, you still keep her pj's? 
That's sick Larry. 
Seriously, you gotta call the shrink. 
I'm coming in the bed Larry. 
Look at this, you made me a little bowling ball ashtray, that's sweet of you 
I'll smoke that in the morning. 
I don't feel comfortable with this buddy, at all. 
Would it help if I gave you the pose? 
Hey, get your foot off that side of the bed. 
Have some respect, would you please? 
I'll be respectful you won't even know I'm here, you won't know I'm here. 
Okay, why don't you turn the light off, you won't even see me. 
I'm not around Larry, yeah, yeah... see, yeah. 
You're alone, make yourself comfortable. 
That's right. 
You got cinemax in here? 
No I do not. 
What the hell am I supposed to do with this thing? 
Keep it away from me. 
Will you lend me your foot for a second? 
I'm kidding. 
Larry... you betrayed me Larry. 
You made a promise no one would sleep on my side of the... 
Alright, I swear to you I will beat you with the end table! 
Larry... if it was me I would stop it man, it was some one else. 
Scared me too, Larry. 
Good morning Daddy. 
Oh, hey kids. Good morning Uncle Chuck. 
What's doing guys? 
Good morning Teresa. 
Good morning. 
Ahhh! Why's Teresa in the bed? 
Uh, she was uh, just cleaning it... great job Teresa. 
Spotless, thank you, you can go now. 
Hey, this is what got us in trouble in the first place! 
Come on kids, fix me breakfast. 
Come on, come on, come on, come on. 
You're going to burn for that. 
Get cinemax. While I'm sleeping in the same bed? 
Hey, you weren't sleeping the whole time. 
You threw in some moves. 
I did not! 
Yep, smell your thumb. 
It smells like plastic! 
Hey, big guy. What the hell you doing going through our garbage? 
Oh, once it's out on the street ready for pick up it's public property. 
Lawrence Valentine, I presume? 
Yeah, that's me. 
Clint Fitzer from financial services. 
You know, funny thing, you put these moving boxes out for recycling after you'd already been living together for so long. 
I found that interesting. 
And your garbage, Mr. Valentine... well, from my experience it's not very homosexual garbage. 
Uh, can I see some indentification please? 
Well that's just one zip away. 
Mr. Valentine the law takes a dim view of those who cheat... a very dim view, big guy. 
Shit. 
What are you doing? I'm putting a pillow case on my pillow. 
You know what, that's not a pillow case, it's my underwear you idiot. 
No! 
Would you stop? I just ran into Clint Fitzer out front, that big city investigator. 
The one that hot ass lawyer was talking about? 
We got to make this place more gay. 
More gay? 
Yeah, he went through our trash, he said it's not gay enough. 
Well let's gay that shit up then. 
Gay trash, gay trash, gay trash... 
Heh, heh? 
Yeah. 
Anything you can do, I can do better, I can do anything better than you. 
Perfect. Hey! Eric, are those the cleats I just bought you? 
Uncle Chuck helped me turn them into tap shoes. 
Yeah, he didn't get Pippen, so we're going to prime him for his next audition. 
For the Annie Get Your Gun thing... go ahead, tap away. 
Sinatra tap danced, come on. 
Nice, nice... big finish. 
Yeah! You want to throw him in the garbage? 
I'm kidding, come on. 
Think like a gay guy, we're gay, we're gay... 
Oh here we go look at this, shampoo for permed hair, that's pretty gay. 
Put it in there. 
Okay. Bandages? 
Nah, that's too rugged. 
Really? Q - tips! 
Get Q-tips. Gay guys like clean ears for the licking and what not... smart. 
What do you got? 
Maxi pads. 
Now we have vaginas? 
Put it back! 
Get some Streisand shit or something, just walk away man. 
Gay. Very gay. Oober gay. 
Oh! 
Chuck! 
Alex. Hi! 
Wow. Oh hey, did Larry tell you I talked to him about Fitzer stopping by? 
That guy is an infection, but don't you worry about because I'm going to handle it. 
Oh, it's all good... it's all gay. All the way. 
Are you doing anything on Saturday night? 
No, why? 
Well, I'm invoved with this group and it's our big fund raiser thing and look, I know it's a little bit last minute, but... 
No, no, no... hey, let's do this. 
Let's party, wow! Awesome! 
Awesome! Okay. 
It's going to be a lot of fun... 
I'm sure! 
and here's the info... 
Hell yeah. and don't forget to bring your husband. 
My husband... yes, of course. 
I don't go anywhere without him, he's like uh, he's like an infection too. 
Are you going to be bringing your significant other, person thing? 
Oh, I'm not gay if that's what you mean. 
And I just broke up with my boyfriend, so... 
Oooh! 
I mean oooh. 
It's fine, so am I going to see you there? 
I'll be there. 
Okay. 
Oh, you want to go... 
Yeah. See ya. 
Yeah. 
Hell yeah! 
Sorry, did you say something? 
No, they got uh uh, KY Jelly two for a dollar... hell, yeah! 
Okay... bye! 
This does work. 
Got some mail for you Mr. Valentine. 
Oh, okay... thanks Ron. 
Something I can do for you? 
I uh, couldn't help overhearing you and Mr. Levine talking about your arrangement the other day. 
Oh yeah uh... we're, we're a couple so... 
Right. I also caught a bit of what you said pertaining to me. 
What, I'm sorry? I heard you mention to the gentleman that you thought I was a hotty. 
Oh yeah, you know I'm sorry if that came off a little weird... 
Oh no no no no, it's nothing to worry about sir. 
I don't bite. 
Oh okay. Listen, just so you know, if you're ever home alone in the afternoons I make drop offs. 
Oh boy. 
And I always deliver. 
You know, I'm pretty loyal to Chuck. 
Right, I understand. I'm just saying if you ever want to uh explore your other feelings. 
There's no extra postage and it's always first class. 
Alright, anything else you feel you need to say there? 
I handle with care. 
Okay Ron, thank you very much I appreciate it. 
I'd be happy to come in through the back door. 
I'm sure you would. I'm used to holding large packages. 
This actually ain't going to bad man. 
Just some regular gay folks having a party. 
Aha ha ha... 
Oh my God! 
You know what, find Alex, say hello and let's get the hell out of here. 
I'm going to take a leak. 
You're going to go to the men's room? 
Here? What's wrong with that? 
I peed three times before I got here. 
It'll be fine. 
Oh yeah, there's my lawyer. 
Look at that perfection. 
I want to suck your blood! 
Suck my what? 
Nothing. No, it's cool, you want to suck something. 
I uh, was talking to somebody else. 
Hey, don't go bitch... don't be a tease! 
You whore! 
Oh my God. Alright, let's do this. 
Chuck, hey! 
I'm so glad you made it! Alex, that's you, right? 
Yeah... 
Oh ho... Wow, so I had no idea Dracula could look so fierce. 
I like Betty Butterfly the most. 
That's my brother Kevin. 
Your brother? 
You're related to him? 
Yes! 
He's got to come out of the closet already, I feel bad it must beat him up inside knowing he's got so many secrets. 
My underwear's just riding up my core. 
Seriously, I got some apple sauce going on down there. 
I can't wait to launder that load. 
What's up apple dumpling? 
What's crack-a-lackin? 
What's crack-a-what, I'm sorry who are you? 
Do I know you? Oh, I'm sorry I'm Kevin, Alex's brother. 
Oh, oh hey man! 
Larry... um Chuck's better half. 
Better two-thirds actually. So I got a question, I know you know it's coming. 
Don't do it! 
I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it! Don't do it! 
Who's pitching and who's catching? 
You mean who's the chick and who's the guy and that kind of thing? 
Please don't feel obligated to answer that, it's none of our business. 
I know it's not, but it's fun to know. Not a problem. Let's see, this is going to be a cool experiment. 
Who do you think is the chick out of us two? One, two, three... 
Chuck! 
It's so Chuck! I know! 
What do you mean, Chuck? Ohhh! 
Why, why would you think I'm the chick? 
Well, he's an apple, very masculine... very solid fruit. 
And you're uh Count Suckula with a straw in your beer. 
I'm drinking through a straw because I don't want to smear my lipstick. 
Oh yeah, that was worse, alright. 
I also think it's because you have very sweet sensitive eyes and that's very rare to find in a guy. 
Well you have very sweet and sensitive eyes too. 
I do? 
Us chicks should stick together, huh? 
Take it easy buddy. 
Girls rule and boys drool! 
Yeah. 
Oh my God! 
Are you okay? 
Breathe! 
This is my jam! 
This is my jam, you know that this is my jam, watch my drink, okay? 
This is my jam! 
So... you going to show me your moves? 
Oh my God he's got the flags out. 
I can't dance to this shit, can you? 
Hell no! 
Look at these guys man, they're freakin Travolta's. 
Gay guys know how to dance good, it's like the law or some shit. 
Get in the circle right now! 
Any second! 
I can't wait! 
I can't wait! 
Look at this. 
Hey the butterfly's coming out of his cocoon again. 
That's my brother! This is his jam, it is his jam! 
Ah, Kevin's having fun. 
I didn't need to see that. 
I'm flying! 
This is not good, look at this. 
Sorry... 
Alright Larry get up, that's it, that's it. 
We're busted dude, we're busted. Let's go junior high on their ass. Junior high? 
Yeah, let's do this! 
Okay. 
Is it working? 
I don't know I'm afraid to look up. 
I think it is, I think it is. 
Oh my God, we really pulled this one out of our asses! 
Bad choice of words there Larry. 
Bad choice of words. 
Hey Chuck, Larry we got a basketball game every Tuesday night at six, if you want to play the butterfly knows how to get a hold of us. 
Okay, right on, thank you, thank you. 
We'll give you a buzz, nice to meet you guys. 
Sinners and fornicators! 
We are not here in anger! 
We are here to save you from eternal damnation! 
Wait, wait. 
Come on already this is a private event, now give it a rest. 
Aren't you worried about where you'll spend eternity? 
! Is this what these guys do on a Saturday night? 
They just want every one to be as miserable as they are. 
Gay is not the way! 
Gay is not the way! Gay is not the way! 
It's okay baby. 
Hey, hey, hey... you heard the man, it's private party so take a walk. 
This is a public sidewalk, we have every right to be here. 
And we have every right to be queer! Yeah! 
Homosexuality is an abomination. 
Hey uh, news flash man, that jacket's an abomination! 
Gay is the way! Hey, what makes you think you have the right to dictate how other people live their lives? 
I'm a minister, I'm allowed to preach in any public forum. 
Well, I'm a fireman and I say you're blocking emergency access let's call it a night guys. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa... you're a fireman? 
You are a disgrace. 
You're a flamer is what you are. 
There's no reasoning with these people, just let it go. 
Have a good day. See you later! 
Faggots. 
I'm sorry, what did you call me? 
Oh I called you a faggot... faggot. 
For your information the accepted vernacular is gay. 
Wooooo! 
Homo's one... crazy people zero, official score! 
Gentleman I have a very simple philosophy. 
What you shove up your ass is your own business. 
Captain. Shut up. 
Now, it's not my style to get involved in the personal lives of my firemen and if sometimes I've given you the impression that I'm your friend 
However, I seriously doubt that you two are banging each other. 
You and Paula were the most beautiful couple I ever laid eyes on. 
And you, if my pencil sharpner had a skirt I'd have to hide it. 
Look, do you have any idea the stress an administrative position entails? 
I've already got a prostate the size of a cantelope. 
And now thanks to you two bozos I've got the pension department pissing up my chimney. 
Not to mention every flaming fruit bat south of Poughkeepsie that wants to come down here to our house and slide up and down our pole. We should tell him. 
We're telling the truth, we're telling the truth. 
Ixnay on the uthtray. 
I don't want to hear about it. 
And if this marriage is something you've cooked up in response to this pension problem, you are not taking me down with you. 
I will report you, you will go to jail. Where you won't have to pretend to be gay because your asses will be busier than a test bench in a plunger factory. 
I just wanted to thank you again for what you did at the fund raiser. Oh yeah, that... that was no big deal. 
You sound a little down, where's Larry? 
He's at school with the kids doing the career day thing. 
So does that mean that you can have a girl's day with me? 
A girl's day? Yeah, I need some new shoes, new underwear... 
A girl's day! Uh huh! 
Oooo Oooo, girl's day! 
Sure! 
I'll pick you up. 
So, by trading in prerefunded municipal bonds we can offer our clients triple tax exempt returns. Any questions? 
Thank you Mr. Auerbach for that very nice trip down Wall Street. 
Our next parent is Larry Valentine, Tori's father. 
Hi everybody, I am a firefighter and I'm proud to be one because it's my job to protect the community and make sure it's a safe environment for all. 
Whoa! You got some questions already. 
Yeah. 
I don't like girls either, does that mean I'm gay too? 
Uh, uh... no, no. You were married to a woman, right? 
Yes. Does that mean you're half lesbian? 
Kids, Mr. Valentine is here to talk about his career today, okay? 
Mr. Valentine, you said you were a fireman. 
Yes, that is correct. Do you have two jobs? 
Because my Dad said that you're also a butt pirate. 
Steve. 
Rough crowd, huh? 
Kids. Yeah. 
So listen, we're all set for the boyscout overnight this month. 
Oh great, we're all set? 
No, we're all set like we don't need anymore fathers. 
Alright, well I guess I'll see you at Little League then, alright? 
Oh you know what? 
We're good. 
We are good? 
No, no, no, no... we're not good. 
We don't need you for Little League, we're good. 
Okay Steve, what's going on? 
I signed up to coach three months ago. 
Lar... I don't want to get into this with you here. 
Hey, you know what Steve? 
You're really starting to piss me off. 
I'm trying to get Eric interested in baseball. 
That kid interested in baseball? 
You got a better chance getting Colonel Sanders interested in a hamburger, buddy. 
Fight! Fight! 
Your Dad's gay and so are you. 
Go back to Jersey! 
Oh, whoa whoa, nice pad! 
Oh, thank you. 
Hey you are soaked, do you want to borrow a sweatshirt or something? 
No no no, I'm great, I'm great... 
Thank you. Okay, but I am freezing so... 
What are doing there? 
Oh... I'm all wet. 
Actually, you know what? 
I'll take that sweatshirt. 
Oh yeah. 
So uh, that's a great body you got there. 
I mean, it could be the best body I've ever seen in my life. 
Shut up! 
Besides Larry's. 
But yours, your tush looks like it's made of muscle and Larry's is made of pudding and quarter pounders and God knows what. 
Well, these are real by the way. 
I mean, nobody thinks they are, everyone thinks they're fake but they are real. 
Alex, you're going to lie to me? 
We're two girls hanging out, come on! 
Are you kidding me? 
There's no silicone here I swear. 
Well no big deal if they are or not, I don't care. 
I've got nothing to hide... feel them. 
Feel them? 
Feel them. 
I mean I uh, uh uhh, uhh, I have a uh 
I'd rather feel a flabby man pec, to be honest with you. 
But, in the name of science if you need me to hold your bodacious bahama mamas or whatever the guys call them nowadays 
I'll do it. 
Yes, go ahead. 
Ummm... 
Well? 
Yeah, they're real. 
Told ya. 
And creamy and fun for someone who would like something like this. 
I just got a little nauseous there touching them. 
You want a bite? 
No no no, feeling them's enough, I'll do that again. 
No, I meant food, are you hungry? 
Oh! 
I'm sorry yeah, no I uh just... that was funny! 
Wait wait wait, me and Nootzie against you three guys. 
You don't want to play? 
Hey Chuckie I gotta be honest with you, you play real physical defense and none of want you copping a feel or uh rubbing up against the ole bushkadush here. 
Just because you're gay doesn't mean you're horny for every guy you meet. 
Oh really? 
Cause everytime you covered me in the past I feel like you were grab assing on me. 
Yeah, let the WNBA play. 
Come on. 
Fine... go. 
Oh God. What? You want to mess with me too? 
Huh, you want to mess with the queer? 
Cause this queer don't take shit from nobody. 
Let's go then. You ready? 
I'm a fireman man, I ain't afraid of nothing! 
Put your fists down. 
Me too. 
You too? 
You too what? 
I'm gay. 
I can't believe I finally said it. 
Oh God, it feels so good. 
It's like a wave is crashing over me. 
It's so liberating. Oh yeah. 
Do you remember the first time you said it? 
The first time I said... yeah, yeah I was with Larry. 
Your lover. 
Yeah. 
Who, by the way, is absolutely gorgeous. 
Ah thanks, uh he's mine though, so... 
I know, that's your man... mmm hmm. 
Yeah. My whole life I've been living a lie. But you and Larry have given me the strength to be true to myself. 
To thine ownself be true. 
There's nothing worse than pretending to be something that you're not. 
Yeah, yeah well I'm glad... 
I'm glad we helped you out and uh, anything else we can do, you don't hesitate to ask. 
Would you help me tell my parents? 
Whoa, whoa! 
Oh yes yes yes girl! 
Hey, you guys catch that Met game last night? 
They got a shot of my cousing throwing a beer at the ump. 
I missed it, I took my sister to the electrolysis place for a second opinion. 
They said there's nothing they can do. 
What the hell is so funny? 
Noooo! 
I ain't picking that up. Want my soap Renaldo? 
Right here. 
Hey Tony, give me your soap. 
No, I don't share soap, too many germs. 
Come on, give me the damn bar of soap, give it to me! 
Hey Duncan. 
Tell you about that later. 
Alright take a look. Okay. 
Girls rule with a z. 
This is so awesome. 
I hope you like yours. 
Let's see here. 
Friends forever. 
Anything with forever and you in it sounds pretty good to me. 
This is great. Slide her on. You know what's still bugging me though? 
That those guidos wouldn't let you play basketball with them. 
We could get a court order and have them suspened in two seconds. 
Court order... no no no, these guys are good guys they're just having problems adjusting. 
Calm down, relax, finish your wine, come on. 
Okay. 
But you know what would really help me to relax? 
Is a foot rub. 
Please, Please? 
You'll be my bestest friend. 
Oh, they're good. I can handle it. 
You know I love that you're a chubby chaser by the way. 
Chubby what, what? 
Well you know, Larry's heavy set. 
I mean is that always the type of guy you've been attracted to? 
Uh, no, he's my first fatty. 
Yeah, you guys really seem like you have a lot of sexual chemistry. 
I float his boat and he sinks mine. 
Yeah, I've never had that, really had that with anybody before. 
I just... I don't even know if I know what I'm doing. What? 
I'm serious. 
Come on, give me some moves. 
How do you turn Larry on? 
How do I turn Larry on? I uh... 
I mean, to get him in the bed of course, I just lay a pizza out. 
No! Really, seriously. 
Well he likes it when I rub his big hairy earlobe. 
Yeah, it's a spot of his. 
Try it on me. 
Try it on you? 
Yeah yeah, you know I just grab it and usually when I do this to Larry he's like boing. 
I love it. You do? 
Yeah. Like that? 
Sure sure, yeah, work both hands I like that. 
Then you can go to some hair pulling, right about like that. 
Like that? 
Yeah, ooo, yeah let him know you're there, know what I mean? 
And a slap out of nowhere is good. 
That is good. 
Uh huh. 
Yeah, not ultimate fighting kind of smacking just light and sexual and fun. 
How did you, how did you get to be so good at all this? 
I don't know, just a lot of practice I guess. 
I used to be kind of a, kind of a jerk. 
But uh, then you meet somebody special, makes you not want to be a jerk anymore. 
Actually makes you want to give everything you've got to that one person. 
Yeah, you know it's true when women say that all of the good men are either gay or married. 
And of course I'm hanging out with one who's both. 
Oh, yeah yeah. 
Just for the record though if I wasn't so into chubby hubbies or uh chunky monkies, what did you say again? 
Chubby chaser. 
Oh yeah yeah. 
I would just be so all over you. 
Oh come on, no way. 
Are you kidding me? 
Look at you. 
You're gorgeous and you're smart, passionate, funny. 
I'm just... I'm just so happy I met you. 
Oh yeah, yeah, friends... friends forever. 
Oh yeah. 
Oh my God... oh my God, what are we doing? 
Whoa whoa whoa, hey hey, Alex. 
I just never felt this way about a woman before. 
Because you're gay and you're married and you're my client. 
This is so wrong! 
It's not about right or wrong or gay or straight or hard or soft... 
I can't see you. 
I can't see you except as a client. 
Alex don't, don't say that please. 
I believe in marriage, I believe in what it represents. 
I betrayed you, I betrayed Larry... oh my God, poor Larry. 
Larry, he's a great guy. 
But I got to be honest with you. 
Our marriage is... all he does is watch his baseball games like I don't even exist anymore! 
You have to go I'm sorry. 
He hits me though. 
I'm so sorry, please... please go. 
What the hell's going on out here? 
Nothing I'm just trading a few buckets with Eric and Tori. 
Over here making small talk, you know? 
You'd think on such a nice day, your husband would want to spend time with his family. 
Where is he anyway? 
Is he out straight bashing again? 
No, he's at his mother's he's taking her to the movies. 
No Daddy. 
He's with that smoking hot lawyer lady he always talks about when you're not around. 
He is? Ahhh! 
I just felt a breeze Mr. Valentine and that breeze is blowing straight toward justice. 
Hey guys we got a perpetrator lodged in the air duct. 
Apparently tried to break in last night, got stuck. 
You're the guys from the newpaper, right? 
Yeah, that's us. 
Alright then, you're going to love this. 
The guy got stuck upside down so his ass is still hanging out for you. 
That's pretty funny, did your mustache come up with that? Oh I'm sorry, I don't speak gayinese. 
Hey, anybody, you got to get me out of here. 
I just peed on my face. 
Alright, relax buddy I'm here to help. 
Unlike some people around here who only help themselves. Who you talking about? 
You. 
Why, what happened? 
Fitzer came by today and Tori told him about your obsession with our hot ass lawyer. 
Obsession! 
What, what is she talking about? 
Oh don't even give me that... 
Mr. I'm taking my mom to a movie. 
You know what, maybe if you were around today Fitzer would actually think that I don't know, you like me. 
Hey man, I got to lie to you. 
Thanks to you I got to lie to everybody! 
Especially Alex, I can't be honest with her. 
I can't get close to her, I can't even have freakin fun with her. 
Why can't you have fun with me? 
We always used to have fun. 
Because you've changed, ever since you force me to marry you, you're so God damn controlling, you don't act like my freaking husband. 
You act like my boss. 
You do this, you do that. 
Hey, what time you coming home tonight? 
You're smothering me man 
I can't freaking breathe! 
What you guys need is a bubble bath. Shut up! 
Idiot! 
The only reason you're feeling that way is because you're afraid of feeling trapped. That's what happens when you get married! 
Fat ass, we're not really married! 
I'm just in some gay crazy nightmare! 
That you can't commit to because you can't commit to anything. 
I swear to God, I'm feel like I'm the only one who's trying to make this thing work. 
Work! 
That's right it's become work! 
This relationship is work! 
Face it, we are not supposed to be together. 
I found somebody I really want to be with. 
Instead of being jealous of that why don't you do the same? 
Because I still love my wife. 
Well move on already. 
Your house is like a freaking shrine to Paula. 
One of these days you got to get a real wife. 
One that your kids don't got to lie about every two seconds. 
Nah, you can't keep it in your pants for five minutes and that's why we're so screwed up now! 
Oh whoa, back up buddy. 
You know why we're in this jam! 
Cause you can't open your freaking mail! 
Everything with Paula's name on it gets tossed in a desk and filed under" too painful to deal with"! 
Guys, could you at least call another fire department? 
What is your rush idiot? 
You're going straight to jail anyway! 
You know I can't deal with sleeping next to your stupid ugly face tonight so don't bother coming in the bedroom. 
Oh wouldn't dream of it honey! 
You are a lousy best friend and a shitty husband! 
Hey, for the record, everytime I laughed at one of your jokes I was faking it. 
You're a monster! 
Oh my God it's Mr. February! 
I love you, I love you, I love you! 
Wow, that's a gay bracelet. 
I hope Fitzer sees that. Shut up. 
You needed to see us? 
Shut the door. 
You know for the first time this month I pissed without spraying it in all three urinals at once, so I was in a relatively good mood. 
Until I received this. 
Seems the guys in the company took a meeting and they all signed that petition requesting I transfer you both out of here. 
What? 
Are you going to listen to these idiots? 
! I'm not going to do it, but I have to do something to keep the peace. 
Now personally I think it's just a matter of time before your little act gets busted. 
Until then, you're on separate shifts. 
What? Separate shifts? 
Hey, we've been together forever! 
So were my balls, and now I only have one of them. Wow. 
Valentine go to work, Levine go home. 
Hey fellas. 
Hey, heard you guys have been circulating a petition. 
You mind if I take a look at it? 
Oh, what do you now, I got it right here. 
It's impressive, a lot of names, let's go down the list see who we got here. 
Nootzie! Hey remember that time Chuck and I ran back into that textile plant and dragged your limp body out? 
Even though Chuck's leg was broken like in three different places. 
Man, that was pretty freaking gay of Chuck, huh? Wow! 
Renaldo, man I remember your first day on the job. 
Remember you were so scared you actually crapped yourself? 
And Chuck and I we snuck you back in here, we cleaned you up so nobody'd find out. 
You begged us not tell anyone. 
And did we? 
Let's ask. 
You guys hear that story before right now? 
Show of hands. 
No, but it's hilarious. 
Yeah, it is hilarious. 
Tony! 
Nice signature. 
Hey is that the same one you used to endorse the check that Chuck gave you when you gambled away your mortgage payment on college football? 
I guess his money wasn't too gay to bail you out or keep your wife from leaving you again. 
Again? 
I guess Chuck's not a enough of a man to work next to work next to big strong heroes like you guys. 
Oh look at that, a fire, well I hope it's not a bad one. 
Because the faggot who's been saving your sorry asses is now thanks to you, working on another shift. 
Let's go. 
That's when Sadie said," Love will always help you find your way home". 
Sleeping... sleeping. 
Huh, that was easy. 
Oh you know I love you, but I got to... 
Hey. 
I'm sorry. Me too. 
That stuff I said... I know. 
Can I sleep in the bed tonight? I'd like that. 
Come here. Yeah. 
Handle with care. 
Larry... don't let him sleep on top of me again... 
Don't do the voice, I will kill you I swear. 
Hey! 
You ready for your big day little man? Big day? 
My audition Dad. 
Me and Uncle Chuck have been practicing for weeks. 
He wanted to work with you but I was around so... 
Why don't you do one last rehearsal, let your father play the Annie role? Fabulicious, I'll get my music. 
Did you hear that? 
It's fabulicious! 
Ahh, come on, come on. 
Okay. 
May Me Mi Mo Moo Me Mi Mo May... 
And a russian split! 
Oh, you nailed it! 
My kid is pretty awesome. 
Hey, there's only one guy I know that can dance better than that. Who? 
The homeless guy from our wedding. 
That dude was pretty good. 
Balls and weiners... Is it true? 
Alex? 
Look at this. 
16 depositions from women who have claimed to have slept with you over the last year and half. Just 16? 
Thank God the 500 other ones couldn't read or write. 
You knew about him and all these women? 
Alex, you know what it is? 
We've been through this before. 
Chuck's got a bit of a problem, he messes around with women because he's ashamed of being gay. 
Now is it all just about you or do you really just don't consider anybody elses feelings? No I don't. 
I'm just a big gay jerk. 
What are you doing? 
You know you like that. 
Guys, guys... the shit is about to hit the fan, okay? If I'm going to defend you I have to know the truth. 
You have to look me in the eyes and tell me that you are gay and that this marriage is legitimate. 
Alex, we're gay. Okay and we are married. 
It's real. Can you help us out? 
Okay. 
Okay, this investigation is going to get rough. 
They are going to quiz you about every detail of your lives, every aspect of your relationship. 
But since you guys are telling the truth... then I'm sure you'll be fine. Just for the record, I thought this was a man when I was with her. 
Does that help us out at all? 
Let's go over it again. Your birthdate? 
April 26th, taurus. 
Got it. 
Yours? 
September 9th, virgo. 
How about your favorite brand of underwear? 
That would be Mr. Calvin Klein. I can tell you my least favorite... 
Whoa! 
I love you Mr. February! 
I'm on fire, help me! 
Alright, Mr. February, let's go show these guys how married we are. 
Ah, what the heck. 
What are you guys doing here? 
We're here to apologize and back you up. Like you always did for us. 
Yeah, we've all lost a lot of friends in this job that we will never get back. 
We don't want to lose two more because we were being thick headed. 
Yeah, we're partners for life. 
Not partners like you's two, but... you know what I mean. Yeah. 
I love you's guys. Molest the... 
Hey Chuckie... Yeah. 
I got to ask you something, I mean... 
What's up? Why did you pick Larry? 
I mean, I work out, I tweeze my unibrow... am I not good looking enough for you or some shit? 
No no no, Renaldo, you're just not my type. 
You're a 10. 
I just like them chubby. 
That's my thing. 
I'm a 10! 
You hear that? 
I'm a 10! Woo! 
On a scale to a hundred. 
You're just jealous, cause gay guys like me! 
Good morning everyone, I'm Daniel Banks, city council president and I'll be presiding over these precedings. 
It's going to be a long day so let's dispense with the preliminaries and just get started. Mr. Fitzer... 
Thank you, your councilship. 
That's for later. 
Mr. Valentine, please tell us why you married Mr. Levine. 
Love. 
Yeah yeah, that's what I'm talking about... gay love! 
Please sit down sir. Sorry. 
Mr. Levine... 
Yeah. 
Sixteen local women claimed to have had sexual relations with you as recently as mid April. 
Including four Canadian strippers the morning of your marriage. 
It's true, I did have sexual relationships with them girls, but uh, I was kind of having a commitment issue... 
Larry's forgiven me for that and that's all that counts to me is what Larry thinks. 
That's right Fitzer, you suck! 
One more and you're out, sir. 
Sorry sir, you're cool... he sucks, I'm gay. 
Gentleman, at this time we'd like to interview you individually. 
Mr. Levine, please step outside. 
Yeah, no problem. 
I'll miss you. 
I'll miss you too buddy. Ahh! 
I like it rough! One for the road. 
I did the cooking until Chuck moved in, the toilet was thankful. 
He ain't the greatest chef in the world. 
I'm Wolfgang Puck to his Wolfgang Suck. 
We met back in the fire academy in 1987. 
I was top of our class. 
He burned off his eyebrows first day... gone. 
Larry tried to eat the fire, I remember that. 
His favorite song, Don't Fear The Reaper... 
Blue Oyster Cult. 
You're Beautiful by James Blunt and people think I'm the woman. 
You're beautiful... just gets me everytime. 
You're beautiful... that is, that is a nice song. 
The thing he likes most about me is probably my love handles, all of them. 
I'd say my sweet sensitive eyes, like that of a kitten. 
The worst day we ever had on the job... This little kid fell in a swimming pool. 
Chuck was the first one there. 
I dove in. He pulled him out. 
I worked on him. 
Worked on him, worked on him... 
Larry stayed with me all that night. 
I just couldn't get that kid out of my head. 
When my wife died. 
Ah, that was the worst. 
I collapsed. 
He knew it was coming, but... 
What we have is beyond friendship. 
He's the best man I know. I'd do anything for him. 
I love him. 
What's going on? 
How'd you do? 
It was good, no problem. 
Want me to grab those see if they're real again? 
I'm sorry? 
I says, are we done yet? 
Not quite, they want to talk to the kids. 
Why don't you tell us about their sleeping arrangements? 
Dad and Uncle Chuck sleep in the same bed. Do you know why? 
Because they do everything together. 
Just like Will and Grace. 
It is kind of an unusual situation, isn't it? 
Having two fathers. 
I don't have two fathers. 
I have my Daddy and Uncle Chuck is more like a Mommy cause to me he seems like a girl. Why am I the woman? 
I don't get it. 
Okay, that's all thank you. 
Bottlenose Dolphins, Orcas, Gray Whales, Harbor Seals and West Indian Manatees. 
Huh? Species that sometime mate with the same sex. 
Bottlenose Dolphins, Orcas, Gray Whales, Harbor Seals and West Indian Manatees. 
I didn't know that, but now I'm glad I do. 
Thank you my dear. 
Remind me never to go skinny dipping with the Bottlenosed Dolphins. 
I just have to say that as a fellow gay fireman. 
That's right fellas I'm gay. 
You guys have a problem with that? 
Chuck and Larry, you've inspired me to want to find my soul mate. 
Where ever he may be. 
Hey, I'm a 10. 
I'm a 10. 
You're not my type, sorry. 
Fitzer, can we wrap this up? 
I just have one more question to ask if these gentleman would indulge me for a moment. 
By all means Mr. Fitzer. 
Chuck, Larry, would you say that there's a fair amount of passion in your relationship? 
Absolutely. 
More passion than you could imagine, boy. Yes. 
How wonderful. 
Now if you'd be so kind, I'd like you to kiss each other. 
You'd like, what was that? 
Councilman Banks my clients have been more than accomodating and to ask for a display of intimacy in the middle of a crowded room is simply demeaning. 
I'm afraid I have to agree. 
We seem to have gone from a hearing about fraud to some kind of weird gay witch hunt. 
I'm just saying your excellence, if these two men are as in love as they say they are, I don't see why this should be a problem. 
I'm just asking for one kiss, councilman. Yeah come on fellas. 
Show them how real men kiss. 
Come on! 
I will not stand for it, this is unbelievable, no! 
Absolutely not! 
Hey, come on... no. 
The councilman agreed it's demeaning to us. 
Plus we don't want to get you all horny. 
Me and this guy, we can get steamy. 
Kiss! Kiss! 
Kiss! 
Kiss! 
Order... order! 
You know what? 
Just go for it. 
Well... 
I guess it's show time. 
Going in straight... 
Coming out gay? 
Enough! 
I'd rather change my grandfather's diapers than see two straight guys kissing. 
We're not, we're in gay love Captain, can't you deal with that? 
Oh shut up. 
If these gentleman are gay than I'm a one legged parrot. 
Anybody seen me with a crutch and a cracker? 
I didn't think so. 
And who might you be sir? 
Captain Finneas J. Tucker councilman, you may search my record. 
I hold multiple citations from Mayor Dickens, Mayor Cotch and of course, the great Mayor Giuliani. 
Let me tell you something, these men definitely broke the rules. 
They lied on a government form and they swore it was true. 
Which is despicable. 
But, interestingly enough excellency, even though they were deceitful to us all, 
I actually believe they ended up doing some good. 
What good are you speaking of Captain? 
Well, first off they let us know that when a friend is need you go beyond extraordinary lengths to help out. 
Whenever, whatever... that's the code. 
Then, they apparently inspired fellow firefighter Fred G. Duncan to come out of his super sized closet. 
Thus releasing his rage. 
And preventing what looked like to be an inevitable killing spree. 
And most importantly, they showed us that no matter whom we choose to love be they heterosexual, homosexual, asexual, bisexual, trisexual, quadrisexual, pansexual, transexual, omnisexual or that thing where the chick ties the belt around your neck and tinkles on a balloon. 
It has absolutely nothing to do with who we are as people. 
It's true Councilman Banks. 
We're not gay. 
No, unfortunately we hurt people, people we wouldn't want to hurt in a million years by uh, doing what we did. 
For the record, the word faggot, that's a bad word. 
Don't use it, I used to say it more than anybody but I was ignorant. 
It's hurtful. 
It's like, uh kipe for me. 
Or fat boy for me. 
It stings a little when you poke fun of my weight. 
I didn't know that. 
Yeah, sometimes. I only do it, cause you do it. 
I know but I work hard... What is this? 
Gays of our lives? 
Should we cue the violins? 
This isn't a folk concert, it's a hearing and I believe I hear the sound of two felons going to jail for stealing from the city of New York. 
What exactly have we stolen? 
Nothing. 
Due to a weird rule in a flawed system my friend Larry here had to create this lie. 
The system may be flawed at times, Mr. Feb-blueberry, I'm in a calendar... woo! 
But it's the law and we all have abide by it. 
I'm sorry, but you did break the law. Ahh, God. 
Daddy... 
Councilman Banks, Councilman... 
Well you better have cuffs for three, because I'm going to jail with them. 
How's that Captain? 
I'm a co-conspirator. 
I knew all about this little scam from day one and I didn't say a thing about it. 
Captain! You don't have to do this, please. 
Yeah, he didn't know nothing. 
Fine, I'll have all three of you arrested. 
Slap some cuffs on me, cause I helped them plan the wedding. 
I drove them to the airport. 
I picked out Chuck's dress. 
Dress, why does everybody assume I'm the woman? 
Is it the way I walk? 
What is it? 
And I caught the bouquet in my mouth, I liked it. 
See, that's the way works with us fireman sir, you throw one of us in the fire we all go rushing in. 
Yeah! 
You throw one of us in jail, you got to throw the whole lot of us in jail. 
So... what's it going to be? 
Everything would have been fine if you'd just let me and Larry make out like we were gonna. 
Then you had to go all Newt Rockley on us. 
I am your commanding officer, I will not be addressed in that manner. 
Not in here you're not you bookie pine head. 
No, in here you're the big mouth who got us locked up. 
We should whoop your ass. 
Yeah! 
Hey Chuck. 
Free Chuck and Larry! Free Chuck and Larry! 
What? 
Yo, dum dum... you got a visitor. 
Well, gentleman. That was quite a hearing. 
Mr. Levine, Mr. Valentine. 
Alright. 
The city would like to offer you a deal. 
We're willing to drop all charges and allow you to keep your benefits with two conditions. 
One, you plead guilty to falsifying a government form. 
The charges are reduced to a misdemeanor, you get a slap on the wrist and the city saves face. 
Done. 
Done. 
Two, you're celebrities in the gay community now. 
They've obviously not only accepted your apology, they think you're heroes. 
Now, raising money for AIDS research is still very crucial and the community has figured out a way for you all to help. 
Whatever it takes. 
Yeah. What do you need us to do? 
We're in. 
These two guys right here talking about doing something pretty serious. 
Making a commitment to love each other forever. 
Now, before they were on the down low, living a life that was lie. 
Now a lie is like a circle, it never ends. 
You know it's not like a rectangle that has a bunch of places that stop this one is a big circle... 
Okay, you know wrap up the circle thing, come on. 
Moving on. 
Do you Kevin Butterfly McDonald take Fred G. Duncan to be your lawful wedded partner? 
I dizoo! 
And do you, Fred G. Duncan take this guy over here to be your lawfully wedded partner? 
I do. 
Well then, by the power vested in me by the Commonwealth of Canada and the Province of Ontario which has always been very pro gay unlike that uptight country to the south, it's my pleasure to now pronounce you husband and husband, partners for life. 
There's my lawyer, you don't want to dance, do you? 
I don't think so. 
Your brother forgave me, now why can't you? 
Well, my brother wasn't the one that you felt up under false pretenses. 
You mean you only let me touch your boobs because you thought I was gay? 
That's sexist, I could bring that to the court room... you could be my lawyer. 
Look at Larry though, it looks like he took my advice and moved on. 
Which is great for him, but I don't have anybody to hang out with anymore. 
I mean these bracelets here says friends forever... 
I haven't taken this thing off since we made them that day, you? 
Yeah, that's what I thought. 
Well, you've got about 30 seconds before I come to my senses. 
Really? 
Yes. 
And this is my jam too. Come on. 
What a delicious looking cake. 
Oh, maybe Tori would like to try it. 
That's nice, you're gay... you have daughter, that's nice. 
No, I'm not gay. 
This is Larry's daughter, Tori. 
Oh it's okay man, you can come out of the down low. 
I don't have to come out, I'm married. 
Where's your husband, point him out. 
No no, the lady in there. 
Which guy? 
No guy. 
Hey you know when you lie it's like a circle. I'm not lying. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER : 
Good morning, Las Vegas. It's another beautiful day. 
For those of you driving near the Strip, be careful. 
There's a bull on the loose. That's right. 
I said a bull. 
God, I love this town. 
Hey, Mike. 
Hey. 
You ever have one of those days? 
Yeah, I'm having one now. 
Not that kind of day, the other kind. 
You know, where you wake up happy and the light just seems to dance differently and the birds are chirping and your heart is open. 
No. 
I don't have those days. 
But you can, you know? 
I finally realized that it's just about attitude. 
You can choose exactly how you want to feel. 
Ah. Like, look at this guy. 
He's made a choice to be happy. 
I don't think that's happy. 
I'll be right back. 
Delinda. 
Hey. How are you doing? 
Beautiful day, isn't it? 
Like how you dance. 
That's right. 
Keep it moving. 
Hey, what are you doing to my husband? 
Oh, I'm just following his lead. 
He's not dancing. 
He's had a stroke. 
And I'm sure if he could talk, he would tell you that he doesn't appreciate you making fun of him. 
But I... 
Save it. 
Yo, that was cold-blooded, D. 
But I didn't mean... 
Save it. 
How's your day going now? Hmm? 
Mm... Those birds still chirping? 
Danny! 
Hey. 
Hey. 
Your boy, Jim, who you got the valet job for is looking for you. 
Hey, did you hear about the rodeo bull running down the street? 
Is this a joke? 
No, I heard about it on the radio. 
I guess some truck with a bunch of bulls from the Vegas rodeo crashed. 
One of them got away and I guess they lost him somewhere behind the Wynn. 
How do you lose a 2,000-pound bull? 
Bulls are surprisingly crafty. 
And if I were you, I would change that tie. 
Don't wear anything red. They hate red. 
No red, cool. So, uh, listen, I was hoping I could borrow some scratch. 
Yeah, man. What do you need? 
Uh, I got... 
Ten grand. 
What do you need ten grand for? 
Remember the condo I put a bid on? 
No. 
Well, I put a bid on a condo and now the seller's asking for another ten G's. 
He says I got to have it by today or he's going to go with another offer. 
I got to have this place, man. 
I wish that I could help you... 
But you can't. 
Why don't you ask Ed for an advance? 
He can be quite generous when he's not being insane. 
If you do, do not let him guilt you into doing anything for him around the house. 
This is very important. 
What are you talking about? 
Well, I... I asked to borrow a couple grand to fix up my car. 
The next thing you know I'm hanging drywall for him in his guesthouse. 
I didn't know he had a guesthouse. 
You see what I mean? 
Good luck. And remember, no red. 
Dude, I just saw a bull running through the parking lot. 
MAN 1 : No way! 
You serious? 
MAN 2 : I'm so hammered. 
Yeah? 
What? 
Where? 
I'm on my way. 
DANNY : Jimmy? 
You looking for me? 
Danny, hey. Hey. 
How's the new job? 
Good. 
Real good. 
The tips are really something here. 
You know, you just keep grinding it out and you'll be out of your hole in no time. 
Yeah. 
About that. 
I mean, this is real hard for me to ask. 
Jimmy, it's me. 
Just tell me what you need. 
Money. 
Well, that seems like a common theme today. 
I've got, uh, a couple hundred. 
No, I need more than that. 
A lot more. 
You know what, I'm sorry. 
Forget I even asked. I can... 
I can probably come up with a couple grand. 
No, no, no. 
Don't worry about it, okay? 
Okay. Are you sure? 
It's all good. 
Okay. 
Let me get back to work. 
Yeah, Mike. 
In where? 
Sanitation just found him. 
All right. Call Metro. 
Victim had what looked to be a.38-caliber bullet in his head. 
And the card of a Montecito employee in his pocket. 
Well, that's Jimmy Willis's card. 
He's a valet here. Yeah. I'm going to need to talk to him. 
Hey, it's Jimmy. 
Listen, I need more time to come up with the money. 
No, please. Just one more week... 
Please. 
mike : 
Still no id on the body. Metro is wrapping it up. 
They should be out of here in about an hour. 
Do whatever you can to help, but keep it quiet. 
By the way, what happened to your tie? 
Oh, see, uh, a bull got loose from the rodeo... and Danny said not to wear anything red because it drives them crazy. 
And they're crafty. So, I took off my tie because it was red. 
Never mind. 
Uh, listen, Ed, I need to ask you something and you know I wouldn't ask you unless... 
How much? 
What? What? 
Um... 
Ten thousand. See, I'm buying a condo and... 
Fine. 
Ed, thank you. 
I will pay you back as soon as I can. 
I know that. So, listen, Mike, I've been thinking of building one of them brick barbeques for the house. 
Something nice out there by the pool. 
Yeah. What do you say you come over Saturday and give me a little hand, huh? 
Saturday? 
Yeah. 
Saturday, I'd love to but I'm moving my stuff into the new place. 
What's up? 
Ran out of ink or something. 
Did you say Saturday? 
Yeah. Because Saturday, you know, Saturday is good for me. 
Saturday is wide open. 
Uh, how about 10 : 00 a.m.? 
How about 7 : 00? Even better. 
Look at that. 
It's writing again. 
Wow. 
Do me a favor and, um... don't cash this in here. 
You got it. 
I guess we'll see you, uh, 6 : 30, Saturday morning. 
All that stuff will be out back there. 
Try to keep the noise down. 
Please put on a tie, will you? 
You got it, Ed. 
Thank you! All right. 
Yeah? 
What do you mean, two guys from State Gaming are here? 
To see me? 
They were here three weeks ago. 
This is starting to piss me off, okay? 
Hey, I wonder what he's like in person. 
I mean, I know what he's like. 
Or at least, I think I know what he's like, but I wonder what he's really, really like. 
They say he smells really good all the time and... 
Hey... 
He has a huge... 
Hi. 
Hi. Who are you talking about? 
Uh... 
Keith Mannix. 
Who's Keith Mannix? 
Who's Keith Mannix? Mmm-hmm. 
Who is Keith Mannix? 
That's what I just said. 
Who's Keith Mannix? 
Uh, three-time MVP, seven-time all star, number three on People's most eligible list drop-dead gorgeous Keith Mannix. 
So, pro basketball player, Keith Mannix? 
Yes. He's staying here with us, in our hotel. 
Yeah, how come he's not on my vip list? 
All I have is some guy named Moses Guthrie. 
And I don't know... That's him. 
Moses Guthrie is Keith Mannix? 
Yes. Moses Guthrie was Doctor J's character's name in the movie. 
The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh. 
He always travels under that name. 
Why do you know that? 
I read Jet. Of course you do. 
Last time I hosted a basketball player, all he did was hit on me the whole time. 
Well, Keith is not like that. 
His player bio describes him as very sensitive. 
Oh, really? 
Yes. Let me explain something to you, Mary. 
All pro basketball players are the same. 
Egotistical, womanizing attention whores. 
I don't plan on giving him any different treatment than I would any other vip. 
Excuse me, Sam? 
Yeah. 
Mr. Guthrie? 
Please, call me Keith. 
I use Guthrie to fly under the radar. 
Well, hi, Keith. Welcome to the Montecito. 
We have a lovely suite available for you, so if you will follow me, I will take you right to it. 
I want to sign your balls. 
No... I... Want you to sign my balls? 
If you could sign my balls... 
Will you please sign my ball for me? 
Okay. Please? 
Thank you. Okay. 
There you go. 
Thank you. Okay. Right this way. 
Thanks. 
Okay. Thank you. 
Hey, Sharon. 
Hey. Did you have any complaints today? 
No. 
Oh, thank God. 
As a matter of fact, it's been a good day around here. 
We settled a possible discrimination suit. 
What was it about? 
It was a reaction by a worker to a customer telling an awful joke. 
He wanted to sue us claiming a hostile work environment. 
What was the joke? 
( TELEPHONE ringing ) You'll excuse me. 
Human Resources, this is Sharon. 
Actually, he just walked in to sign the settlement. 
" A black eye, a fat lip and a job." 
What? 
That's it, man. 
I'm not signing any damn settlement. 
You know what? Now I am suing your ass. 
What? 
Me? No, no, no, no, no. 
I was just reading. 
My lawyers will be in touch. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm really not like this. 
I'll write him a note. 
That's two. Two visits in one month. 
Why is the Gaming Commission busting my balls? 
Well, sir, a number of complaints involving the Montecito have come to our attention. 
And because we regulate the Montecito's gaming license, the inquiries fall into our jurisdiction. 
May we? 
What... 
What kind of complaints are we talking about here? 
Some of the grievances cited unprofessional conduct in the Montecito, while others ranged from verbal intimidation to actual physical confrontation. 
Just give me the names of these employees cited and I will investigate each matter internally. 
All the complaints filed are against you personally, Mr. Deline. 
Me? 
Let me see the complaints. 
I'm sorry, but we can't. 
To avoid retaliation, we do not disclose the complaining party's information. 
Smart. 
Yeah. 
So, where does that leave me? 
Am I supposed to get a lawyer or something like that? 
Only if you want to dispute these charges in front of the board. 
Keep in mind, though, that if you're found guilty of even a single charge, you will be forced to forfeit the Montecito's gaming license. 
That would be, uh, not good. 
What's behind door number two? 
You agree to treatment by one of the board-certified specialists in this area. 
What kind of specialist are we talking about? 
Anger management? 
You want me to go to an anger management class? 
What are you, out of your mind? 
I'll go. 
I'll make an appointment. 
Today. 
And remember, if this doesn't go well... 
The Montecito will lose its gambling license. 
Have a nice day. 
So, I reserved the cabana for you at the pool. 
And if there's anything else that you might need during your stay, please don't hesitate to ask. 
Well, there is one more thing you can do for me. 
You see, I hate dining alone and I would really enjoy the company of a beautiful woman at dinner tonight. 
Well, that's such a nice offer, but... 
I would love to ask your friend. 
My friend? 
Yeah, the girl downstairs holding the basketball. 
Downstairs... 
Oh, Mary? Mary. 
Okay. Yeah. 
Yeah. 
I would love to ask Mary. 
Oh, her? 
Really? Okay. 
Well, you should do... 
You should go for it. 
Welcome to the Montecito. 
Are you new to the program? 
Are you new to the program? 
Oh, uh, yeah. Well, come on in. 
We're about to get started. 
How you doing? PAUL : 
It looks like we have somebody new today. 
What's your name, friend? 
I'm Ed. 
Hi, Ed. ED : 
How you doing, guys? Welcome, Ed. 
Why don't you share a little something about yourself with the group? 
Like what? 
Like when did you first realize that you might have a problem? 
Well, I mean, I really wouldn't call it a problem. 
That's denial, Eddie. Denial, man. 
Let it out, brother. 
Let go of your pain. 
I haven't got any pain. 
And it's never Eddie, douche bag. 
Ed, you have friends here. It's okay to let go. 
Now close your eyes. 
Get the hell out of here. 
Please, close your eyes. 
No, you please. Ed. 
Please. 
Okay. 
Now relax. 
Take yourself back to that first time. 
What was happening around you that made you want to publicly masturbate? 
What did you just say to me? 
What made you want to masturbate in public? 
I don't do that, you creep. What are you running here, a freak show? 
This is a workshop. 
What, a workshop for jag offs? 
For chronic and public masturbators. Jeez! 
You're a bunch of sick animals. 
Bastards, why don't you cut your hands off or something. 
Take a pill, you sick bastards. 
Bob, close your eyes. 
Gladly. 
Mr. Deline, you're late. Yeah, I'm, uh... 
I'm really sorry about that. 
I accidentally walked into this disgusting... 
Well, never mind. I'm Dr. Sassen. 
How are you? 
You shake like a girl. What? 
Your handshake is like a little girl's. 
Here's an idea for you. 
How about I crack you right in the mouth and that way you... 
It was a test. 
You had me there good. 
I just wanted to get a sense of what I'm dealing with here. 
Yeah, so, what do we do now? 
We have some work to do. 
Please. jimmy : 
I told the police what I knew. 
I met the guy at a VA support group. 
The cops are looking at you as their only lead. 
I didn't have anything to do with that guy's death. Can you prove that? 
Why do I have to? 
Jimmy, they found your card. 
There was something. 
At our support meeting, Jack, that's the dead guy's name... 
Jack says he met some guy at the blood bank who passes out little black business cards with a phone number on them. 
Tell me about the card. 
Gets you into a big stakes Russian roulette game. 
They'll pay you 20 grand to pull the trigger with one bullet in the gun. 
Forty grand with two bullets. Like that. 
So, you're telling me this guy played Russian roulette? 
And lost. 
Jimmy, please tell me you're not thinking about doing something like this. 
My folks sent me some money. 
It's all taken care of. 
So, can I go now? Yeah. Yeah. 
I'll talk to you later. 
You still looking for players? 
Okay, Ed, how would you react if a man stood right in front of you and said he was going to knock your teeth down your throat? 
Well, Doc, see the first thing you do is you kind of take a half step to the right so you can't get hit with a straight right hand. 
Then I take my thumb and I go right for this eyeball... No. What do you mean? 
No? No. 
Though these are antagonistic words, you have to defuse the situation. 
And go to that place of peace that's within you. Oh, I, uh... 
I don't... 
I don't think so, Doc. 
We know it is not an easy place to get to and that is why we've developed a very effective tool. 
This is your anger pillow. 
My anger pillow? 
I want you to keep it with you at all times and at the first sign of feeling angry, I want you to squeeze it. 
Squeeze the angry pillow? 
Squeeze it and transport yourself to that peaceful place. Give it a try. 
How about I just smother you to death with it? 
How about I call Agent Watman? I'll take the pillow. 
Now, remember, keep it with you at all times. 
And you squeeze it whenever you feel anger coming on. That's the first step. 
Good, good. 
Now, within 24 hours, you're going to feel like a new man. 
What's this 24-hour bit? 
Oh, well, for the next day, you're going to be observed in your work environment. 
And based on our findings, we'll either recommend or not to suspend your license with the commission. 
You're going to follow me around for 24 hours? No, no, no, no. 
We're just going to check up on you from time to time, make sure you're following the program. 
That's all. 
Remember, Ed, find your happy place. 
And squeeze the pillow. 
Hey, that's my car! Hey, stop, you son of a bitch! 
Hey! 
Listen, I need a ride... 
Oh, my God, you will never believe what just happened to me. Keith asked you to dinner. 
Keith asked me to dinner. Wow. 
What a surprise. Have fun. 
Okay. 
What do you think I should wear? 
I was thinking that little black number with super high heels so he doesn't have to bend down too far to kiss me. 
I'm not real interested in your date with Keith. 
Oh, okay. I just... 
I thought you would be happy for me. 
No, I think that you shouldn't get too caught up with him because he's a basketball player and he has women all over the world. 
You're jealous. What? 
Jealous. 
Not. 
You're mad because he likes me and not you. 
Listen to me carefully. 
I could care less about a man like Keith Mannix. 
I'm sorry you feel that way, but it's not my fault that he thinks that I'm sexy and not you. 
Are you high? 
Ninety-eight hundred, ninety-nine hundred, ten thousand. 
Thank you. 
Do as we say or you're dead. 
Right now! 
You, you, move! 
Everybody out of this room now! 
Move it! Move it! Move it! 
Hey, you down! 
Get down on your knees! 
Now! This is no joke! 
Everybody lives. Come on. Come on. 
Quicker. 
Give him the money. 
Put the money in the bag. 
It's going to be okay. 
Wallets, watches, cell phones. 
Take it off. 
Give me your wallet. 
Don't even think about it. 
What do we got here? 
Open it up. 
Slowly. 
Holding out on me? ( ALARM ringing ) 
Let's go! 
Let's go! 
Damn it! 
Watch it, old man. 
I said watch it, old man! 
Next time I'm going to shatter your old hip all over this casino. 
Shatter. Um... 
Listen, you have yourself a nice day and I'm sorry. 
Daddy? Yeah. 
Why are you carrying a pillow? 
Because I'm angry. 
Oh, shouldn't it be because you're tired? 
Honey, I hear you're telling dirty jokes. 
Not dirty jokes, racist jokes. Yeah. 
Don't do that. 
I need you to do me a big favor. 
I need to close down that blackjack table over there. 
So I need all the people to move to another table over there and why don't we just set up this whole section? 
Well, it's just that... Thanks, sweetie. 
That's really great. 
And, uh, just please behave yourself. 
Hi, folks, I'm sorry but we need to close down this section of the casino. 
We have another table waiting for you just right over there. 
So, if you'll just make your way. 
Again sir, I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I do need to close this table down. Just one minute. 
Okay. 
Please, sir, we have another table just right over there. 
I know. 
Just a minute. 
I'd be happy to offer you a free dinner tonight if you'd kindly move to the next table. 
Like I said, I'm going to need a minute. 
Okay, pal, enough is enough. Just tell me. 
What's it going to take to get you to that table over there? 
My wheelchair. 
Oh, oh, I'm so sorry. 
If I could reach you, I'd punch you in the mouth. 
I hate this town. 
Well, see the thing is, I want the condo, but I just got robbed. This happens all the time. 
Don't worry. 
And now I got to get up at 6 : 30 in the morning, that's right, 6 : 30 in the morning and build a damn barbeque. 
I hate this town! 
They really do hate red. 
Help me. 
Danny, you got to do something about the valet. 
It's so backed up, I can't get the limos in for my big players. Well, why is it backed up? 
I don't know. 
Rick said some guy called in sick and your buddy, Timmy... 
Jimmy. Yeah. 
Jimmy quit. Jimmy. What? 
Why? 
I don't know. 
Who cares? 
But it's affecting business so go take care of it. 
Hey, I'm sexy, right? 
Right. 
Right. 
Damn it, Jimmy. 
You don't have a son by that name? Okay. 
Thank you. 
Sorry to bother you. 
Hello, Mr. Willis, do you have a son James? United States Marine Corps? 
You do? 
Good. 
Uh, my name is Danny McCoy. 
I was in the same platoon as your son. 
Well, I, uh... 
I think that Jimmy may be in a little trouble. 
Okay. 
Okay, well, he said that you sent him some money. 
You didn't? 
Okay. Okay. 
Well, if you hear from him, please tell him to call me as soon as you can. 
Danny McCoy. 
All right. 
Thank you, sir. 
Carl, I need to put some money in the safe. Oh, okay, Mike. 
I just wanted mine. What? 
Um, forget the safe. 
I need a room. 
Um, sure thing, Mike. 
How long are you going to be needing the room? 
Hey, Pam, it's Mike. 
Yes, I still want the condo and I have the money. 
Bingo. 
Lost, white boy? 
Looking for Wallace. 
Don't know no Wallace. 
I heard he rolls down here. 
" Rolls"? 
Check out the white boy. 
You five-O? No. 
If you're not five-O, why are you packing then? 
Just tell Wallace Danny McCoy wants to speak to him. 
You better pray Wallace heard of your ass. 
How about this weather, huh? 
It's crazy. 
Danny McCoy. 
I've heard of you, but I don't know you. 
Why you calling on me? 
I need information. 
What do I get out of it? 
Nothing. 
Except I could owe you. 
Wallace is listening. 
An underground Russian roulette game, time and place? 
Now, why you want to go and get involved in all that? 
Time and place. 
Now you owe Wallace. 
Ed, I just want to say thanks again. 
I got the condo. 
Hey, please. 
Any time. 
That's a nice pillow. 
Thanks a lot. 
You heard about this bank robbery that went down this morning? Yeah. Yeah. 
I heard something about it. 
Well, you know, see, people hear this kind of stuff on the news and they get these weird ideas. 
That's why I want a couple of extra security guys on the casino floor, you know, for a couple days. 
You got it. You got it. 
Hey, what about that bull? 
What happened with the bull? The bull... 
Apparently when they were running away from cops, they smashed into that bull. The police... 
Two jag offs... 
One of the guys they found dead and the other guy got away with the money. 
What's the matter? Nothing. 
Uh, let me work on getting that extra security in here. 
Oh, Mike, let's make it 6 : 00 on Saturday. 
I figure this way you can, you know, finish up by sun down. 
And then we can all relax, sit down and barbeque a few steaks together. 
It will be nice, no? Yeah. 
Nice. 
Yeah. 
Excuse me, Mr. Deline. Yeah. What can I do for you? 
Oh, hey, nice pillow. 
Yeah. Thanks a lot. 
Um, that gentleman at the bar has had way too much to drink. 
And we've cut him off, but he's refusing to leave. Okay. 
I'll take care of it. 
Thank you. 
Excuse me, sir, I'm afraid we're going to have to ask you to leave the hotel. 
I will leave when I'm ready to leave. All right? 
Not a second before that. 
Listen, uh, sir, either you leave the hotel or I'm going to have to call the police. 
And they'll remove you. 
You don't want that, now, do you? Okay. 
Okay. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. 
Great. 
Can I just get a glass of water, please, before I leave? Absolutely. 
Some water, please. 
Thank you. 
Hey, you want to hear a joke? Um, no. 
Okay, what's the difference between you and me? 
What is it? 
I'm dry. 
I'm dry. 
Come on! 
Thank you. 
I need to be punished. 
I need dirty sex. 
I need dirty freaky sex. 
After he hangs up, I like dirty, freaky, nasty sex. 
Well, I'm glad you're coming. 
Yeah, well, I miss your body, too. 
I can't wait to see you. 
I love you, too. Bye. 
Oh, hey, listen, I need to talk to you. I don't want to keep... 
No, you're not going out with Keith. 
Want to bet? 
Listen to me. 
He has a girl coming to his hotel room. 
I just heard him on the phone. He said," l love you" to her. 
You are unbelievable. 
There's no end to how far you'll go. 
He likes me. Not you. 
So do yourself a favor, get over it. 
Mary, Mary, Mary. 
How you doing? Good. 
You look great. Thank you. 
Police officers! 
Let me see your hands! Move! 
Police officers! 
Put the gun down! Wait, wait, okay, let me talk to him. 
Let me talk to him. 
Let me talk to him. 
Sir, sir, I need to get your hands away from your body. Jimmy, put the gun down. 
Why? 
I got nothing left. 
I got nothing. 
You got me. Okay? 
You got your family. This is only about money. We can get you money. 
This isn't you. This is the coward's way. 
Put it down. It's my only way out, Danny. 
No, it isn't. We can... 
We got another plan. 
I promise. Just put it down. 
Put the gun down. 
I'm sorry, Danny. 
( GUN cocking ) Where's my money? 
It's not really your money. 
Okay, okay, okay, okay, it's upstairs. 
Room 1 222. 
Let's go. 
Erica, will you do me a favor and send a bottle of Dom up to the honeymoon suite? 
Sure thing, Sam. 
Thank you. 
Could you move, please? 
He's a dead man. 
All right, take a seat. 
Where's my money? 
It's in the closet. 
I'll get it for you. Oh, no, no, no, no. 
I'll take care of it. 
Put it down now! 
Put the weapon down! 
Up against the wall! 
I'll be seeing you real soon. 
I know where you live. 
I just moved. 
( officer reading rights ) Where's the money, Mike? 
How in the hell did you end up with all this money? 
I was just trying to get my wallet back is all. 
Just between you and me, weren't you tempted? 
A little bit? 
Never. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a barbeque to build. 
Hi. 
Where you been? 
I was helping a friend. 
What's going on here? 
Oh, I'm just making my famous Chicken Delinda. 
For 300? 
It's my plan to show the city of Las Vegas the kind of person I really am. 
You want them to look at you as a cook? 
Not as a cook, a philanthropist. 
I'm not sure giving away chicken is considered philanthropy. 
Oh, but it is. 
Okay, here's my idea. 
From excess to progress, the Montecito will feed and house the homeless. 
Sounds good. 
Yeah, doesn't it? Look at all this chicken here. 
The cooks were just going to chuck it. 
I'm going to take it down to People's Park and feed the homeless. 
I've organized a big kickoff event. 
All the local press will be there. 
And then people will get to see the kind of person I really am. 
Don't you think that's a good idea? 
I think that if it makes you feel better, it's a fantastic idea. 
I do, too. 
You okay? 
Yeah, I'm fine. 
You sure? 
Yeah. Things worked out, so... 
I'm going to let you get back to work. 
Save me some. I'll see you at home. 
Bye, bye. Wish me luck. 
Good luck. 
Keith, open up! 
It's Sam! 
Hey, hey, I'm coming. 
Okay. 
Hey, I was in the shower. 
What the hell's going on? 
I think you know exactly what's going on, don't you? 
Do you really think that you could show up here, take advantage of Mary and no one's going to do anything about it? 
See, brother, I don't care who you are, what kind of superstar you think you are. 
No one pulls this crap with me. 
Oh, how interesting. 
Who you got in there? 
Another unwilling participant in your little sex fantasy? 
You see, Sam? 
I'm gay. 
We have the same taste. 
What are you doing with Mary? 
If anyone ever found out, my career would be over. 
Oh, right, so you invite women out so you can be seen with them in public. 
Yes, and when I told Mary about Terry, she ran out of here. 
Look, Sam, I'm sorry. 
No, no, no, please. 
It's okay. I'll take care of Mary. 
You two go back to doing whatever it is you two do. 
Sam. 
Yeah? 
Can we keep this between us? 
Oh, sure, yeah. 
You were never here, Mr. Guthrie. 
Thanks, Sam. 
I knew I was sexy. 
So, we okay? 
Yeah. 
Sorry I was so bitchy. 
Feels good, doesn't it? 
Little. 
All right, I was Really? 
a little jealous. 
Just a little bit. 
Thank you. 
What do you think? Gay? 
Let's find out. 
Come to mommy. 
I'm here with Delinda Deline of the Montecito Hotel who has a plan to help eradicate Las Vegas's homeless problem. 
Not eradicate, help. 
MAN 1 : Is this chicken cooked? 
It's our program called From Excess to Progress. 
Why do you call it that? 
Well, we're hoping this is the start of... MAN 2 : Mine smells funny. 
MAN 3 : This chicken's making my back hurt! 
Are you getting this? 
There's something in the chicken that's making them drop... 
No, no, no, turn that off. 
Turn that off. 
I'm really not like this. 
What's all this? 
Congratulations, Ed. 
Congratulations, what? 
You passed. 
I passed? 
Even under the most trying circumstances, you put in place the techniques that we spoke about. 
You were able to keep your anger in check. 
Oh. Uh, so, all you guys, you were just... 
Yeah. 
What a guy. 
We needed to evaluate you in extreme circumstances, under controlled conditions. 
And I must say, you surprised even me with your results. 
What now? 
So, nothing. 
Our work here is done. 
I already called the commission and recommended that your license be fully renewed. 
They approved it this morning. 
Really? So, that's it. 
My license has been renewed? 
Congratulations, Ed. 
You're anger-free. 
At least nobody died, which is good, you know? 
How you doing? 
Oh, I should have left it alone. 
Sometimes things just don't work out. 
Sometimes they do. 
See you around. 
Oh! 
Oh, God, I didn't see you. 
I mean, you couldn't see me. 
I mean I really wasn't looking, but, um, I'm really not like this. 
Just let it go. 
I can make it better. 
Just let it go. 
Ed, what the hell are you doing? 
This is what you get for torturing me, you sorry son of a bitch! 
Stop! 
Please! 
Why the hell should I? 
It's not my car. 
Who the hell's car is it? 
It's my car. 
Sorry, Doc. 
Holy crap. 
Sorry. 
Wash away my troubles wash away my pain with the rain of Shambala wash away my sorrow wash away my shame with the rain of Shambala... You got this thing running yet, buddy? 
Nah, but I got your tools all set. 
See if we can get this thing started, okay? 
I thought we needed a new carburetor. 
Well, maybe we don't. 
Come on. 
Slide behind the wheel. 
We'll fire this up. 
What's the matter? 
Go ahead. 
This is stupid. 
Without a new carburetor, it's not gonna work. 
Having hope is never stupid. 
You gotta believe good things will happen, and then they will. 
Understand what I'm saying? 
In this world, son, you gotta make your own luck. 
All right? 
All right. 
Come on. 
Well, what do you want to fix today? 
We're gonna have to put that on hold for a little while,' cause, uh, 
I gotta go to Vegas. 
You know, I got some work out there. 
What about the road trip? 
Well, the Grand Canyon will still be there when I get back, little dude. 
Hey, I got something for you. 
I'm... not supposed to mom says. 
Live a little, Hugo. 
It's just a candy bar, okay? 
- All right. 
- I'll be back before you know it, all right? 
Hold down the fort? 
You're my man? 
All right. 
So then the Others take the bags off our heads and we're on the other side of the island. 
And they take Jack, Kate and Sawyer someplace, and they sent me back to warn everyone to stay away... which I did... and now everyone's freaked out. 
With them gone, and what happened to Eko, they're all scared... and I'm scared. 
But then I've... been scared most of my time here, anyway... except when I'm with you. 
I miss you, Libby. 
Bloody hell. 
- Dude, you okay? 
- Peachy. Really? 
' Cause you've kinda been moping the last- - 
Look, it's not worth talking about, Hurley, okay? 
Dude, you can tell me anything. 
Desmond... said I was gonna die. 
He told me he has these flashes... visions, whatever... and in them, I always die. 
So this is the part where you tell me, 
" it's ridiculous. 
Don't be daft. He's a nutter." 
I think he might be right... and I think it might be my fault. 
Your fault? 
I'm... kinda cursed. 
Death finds me, dude. 
Vincent? 
Is that an arm? 
Here, Vincent. 
Come here, Vincent. 
I think we need to get that. 
Yeah, chase the dog with the skeletal arm into the creepy jungle. 
- You be my guest. 
- Uh, okay. 
If I'm not back in three hours, tell somebody. 
Vincent! 
Vincent, come here! 
Vincent! 
Vincent. 
Awesome. 
It's everyone's fantasy- - winning the lottery- - untold millions falling into your lap overnight. 
What would you do with all that money? 
Well, one such lucky winner recently bought a chicken shack. 
I'm Tricia Tanaka with Hugo Heyes, winner of a record $ 114 million, outside mr. 
Cluck's chicken shack in Diamond Bar, which will be having its grand reopening tomorrow. 
So, Hugo, I think the question on everyone's mind is why did you buy Mr. Cluck's? 
I like chicken. 
Um, also with us is, uh, Hugo's former boss and now employee, Randy Nations. 
That's probably every working stiff's fantasy, isn't it, Mr. Reyes? 
So, Hugo, tell us what else you've done since you got on your lucky streak. 
Actually, I've kind of had some bad luck, too. 
My, uh, grandpa Tito died of a heart attack, and the first house I bought my mom burnt down. 
My friend Johnny ran off with my girlfriend Starla... oh, and this guy jumped off my accountant's roof. 
Cut. 
What the hell was that? 
It's a puff piece, Mr. Reyes. 
Do you know what that is? 
Yeah. 
Sorry, Tricia Tanaka. 
Um, uh, do you mind if we go inside and, uh, shoot some B-roll? 
- Oh, I don't know... 
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Of course you can. Oh, he's just superstitious. 
You know, the ribbon isn't cut yet. 
Okay, let's go. 
Ugh! 
God, I hate this. I always get the stupid stories. 
- Hey, you sure it's okay? 
- Yeah, relax. The safety guards are on the fryers? 
Dude, those fryers are stone-cold. 
All right? We don't even start cooking till tomorrow. 
You hear something? 
And then pan through the- - 
Well, we are out of Dharma oat bars. 
- Already? 
- Yep. Did you check behind the powdered milk? 
Will you pass me the box of cereal? 
Will you... pass me... 
the cereal? 
From now on, I will only speak to you in English. 
It's how you will learn. 
It will be hard at first... 
Hey! 
Hey! 
Hey, everyone, hey! 
Hurley, what is it? 
Is it the Others? 
- Are you okay? 
- What's going on, man? 
Car. 
I found a car... tipped over in the jungle. 
You found a... car. 
And we can totally fix it and get it going again. 
It's not far. 
Come on. 
Why do we need to start a car? 
Because it'll be fun. 
Oh. We could all use some fun. 
I mean, after everything that's happened, we need it. 
Especially you, dude. 
So who's with me? 
Well, I... 
gotta get some bananas. 
Sorry. I don't think so, Hurley. 
Come on! 
Anyone? 
We're gonna drive it! 
Who's coming? 
Thanks, dude. 
You have no idea what you volunteered for, do you? 
Come on. 
Are we there yet? 
If we are where I think we are, then our beach should be just through those trees. 
We'll be home in about five minutes. 
Try to contain your excitement, freckles. 
Forgive me if I'm not excited about explaining why there's only two of us coming back, James. 
Well, maybe they should explain why they ain't come looking for us. 
In fact, I'd be surprised if Locke- - ow! Aah! 
- What happened? 
- Stepped on something. 
Son of a bitch! 
Here, let me see. 
Looks like a... 
Sart. How the hell did it get out here? 
All right, just relax your foot for a second, okay? 
I'm gonna pull it out on the count of three. 
You ready? One... 
Ow! I thought you said three. 
Yeah, well, anticipation's the worst part. 
I thought I would spare you. 
You know, all you have to do is say sorry. 
We could start again, give each other a clean slate. 
A clean slate... 
Like on" little house"? 
- What? -" Little house on the prairie"? 
Laura Ingalls used to write on this little chalkboard at school? 
You call it" Little house"? 
I had mono when I was a kid. 
I missed two months of school. 
We only got one channel in my trailer. 
What are we even talking about? 
Ah, we ain't talking about nothing. 
- James... 
- and I ain't got nothing to be sorry for. 
So that's how it's gonna be? 
Welcome home, Sawyer. 
Welcome home, Kate. 
Hugo? 
Is that you, Hugo? 
Oh, my God. 
What happened? 
- Tricia Tanaka's dead. 
- What? 
it got hit by a meteor... or an asteroid... 
I don't know the difference, but it's gone. 
- That's crazy. 
- It's not crazy. 
It's the lottery money. 
The numbers--I'm cursed. 
And now Tricia Tanaka's dead, and her camera dude, and it's all my fault. 
- It was an accident. 
- It's not an accident. 
It is a curse. 
There's only one way to stop it. 
- I have to go to Australia. 
- Again with Australia? 
That's where the numbers came from. 
Lenny in the institution- - he told me. 
Hugo, Hugo, wait. 
I can prove to you you're not cursed. 
- You can? 
- Yes. 
Come here with me. 
I have to show you something. 
Hey, Hugo! 
After 17 years, your father has returned. 
Hey, wow. Your mom wasn't kidding about those candy bars. 
Just kidding. 
Poor... 
Roger. 
Sorry about your arm, dude. 
Hurley! 
In. 
In. 
Totally. 
Let's check it out. 
Dude, Roger was on a beer run. 
Oh, man, I suck at charades. 
You want to what? 
Oh, you wanna take Roger out... then and turn it over? 
Cool. I understand! 
Okay, on three. 
One... two... three. 
We'll get that later. 
So when's it gonna happen? 
When's what gonna happen? 
Don't play stupid with me... brother. 
I was drunk. 
You know, if I said anything- - 
I have a right to know when I'm gonna die. 
- It doesn't work like that. 
- What doesn't work like that? 
Hey, Oliver Twist. 
Where the hell's my stuff? 
- What stuff? 
- Oh, you know good and damn well what stuff. 
I had books, food, porno, a bottle of scotch. 
Aye, apologies for the scotch, mate. 
You drank it? 
! Well, to be fair, there was, uh... there was three of us. 
Yeah, there was. 
You, the Munchkin and who else? 
Oh, I got it. 
We're gonna tip it up. 
Crafty. 
Crafty? 
Yeah, crafty. 
It's like... when you're good at... crafts. 
Never mind. 
Hey, where the hell's my stuff? 
- What are y'all doing? 
- Dude! 
You're alive! 
- Alive! 
- Yeah, yeah, snuffy. 
It's good to see you, too. 
I'll be damned. Y'all found yourselves a hippie car. 
Pretty cool, huh? 
- Sawyer. 
- Jin-bo. 
- How you doing? 
- Good... see you. 
Well, look at that. 
Somebody's hooked on phonics. 
What about Jack and Kate? 
They with you? 
They all right? 
Kate's with me... but the doc... they still got him. 
Okay, it's okay. 
It's gonna be all right. 
Jack's gonna be all right. 
We all are. Well, what a relief. 
Nah, see, things are getting better. 
The car, you coming back safely- - it's a sign. 
Yeah, a sign I want my stuff back. 
Unh-unh. You're gonna help us fix this thing. 
And why in the hell would I do that? 
'Cause there's beer. 
Why did he say," don't come back"? 
He sacrificed himself so we could escape. 
Probably didn't want it to be for nothing. 
Hurley told us they released Michael and Walt. 
Yep. They gave Michael a boat. 
They took off and never looked back. 
Did you see any other boats? 
No, but something tells me they didn't give away their only one. 
- So they can leave the island? 
- I don't know, John. 
This" zoo" where they held you- - is that where they live? 
We escaped with one of them- - a kid named Karl. 
He said that they live on this island. 
He could've taken us there, but Sawyer let him go. 
Why? 
You're gonna have to ask Sawyer. 
- Kate, where are you going? 
- I don't care what Jack said. 
They've got him, and we have to get him back. 
I owe him that... so I'm going to get help. 
Help from who? 
Now that's a hell of a Jesus. 
Yes. Hugo is such a good son. 
He knows of my love for the Savior, so he commissioned artisans in Taxco to custom carve for me this statue in solid gold. 
Wow, that smells like great lasagna. 
The Trons made it themselves. 
Hugo found them in Bennigan's. 
Now they are our butlers. 
Something wrong, Hugo? 
Your father asked you a question, Hugo. 
My father? 
You're acting like he never left us, like he hasn't been gone for 17 years. 
And all of a sudden he shows up? 
Aren't you at least a little suspicious? 
I showed up because your mom called and said you were in trouble. 
What? 
! All these numbers and curses. 
Hugo, I don't know what to do anymore. 
I thought you needed a manly influence, a father to get you to stop this nonsense. 
I'm not crazy! 
And the only reason he's back is' cause he wants the money. 
Oh, now that hurts. 
Well, guess what? 
There isn't gonna be any money. 
Ha! 
Mr. Tron, lady Tron. 
Your services will no longer be needed. 
Severance. 
Trust me, I'm doing you a huge favor. 
It's only a matter of time before the curse gets you, and you... die, or worse. 
Hugo, what are you doing? 
Getting rid of it, all of it- - the money, the houses, the livestock- - and I'm starting with him. 
No, Hugo. 
Your father is staying with us. 
Staying with us? 
Where? It's been 17 years, Hugo. 
What's been 17 years? 
I have needs. 
No, no, no! 
This can't be happening! 
He has to go! 
He has to! 
I want him gone! - No, you don't. 
- Yeah, I do. 
Why don't you show your father what you have in the garage, Hugo? 
I can't believe it. 
You saved it. 
Tou saved it. 
Me first now. 
Come on. 
What's up with all this recycling? 
You got me, dude. 
Looks like those Dharma freaks were building some sort of dirt road. 
Whoo! Ha ha! Now we're talkin'. 
Hugo... 
Looks good to me. 
Engine's fine, right? 
Son of a- - what's a head doing back here? 
Oh, that's just Roger. 
I'm gonna start the car now! 
Engine... dude, even if you were speaking english, 
I wouldn't understand a word you're saying. 
Just relax. 
We're good. 
This'll work. 
I have hope. 
This will work. 
Damn it. 
Ooh. It's flat, and it stinks. 
Can you get it to work? 
Do you know what's wrong? 
Chill out. 
Let the man do his thing. Dude, that beer's been sitting there since before" Rocky III," 
maybe even" II." It's probably poison by now. 
Skeletor seems to like it. 
Bottoms up. 
That's not cool, dude. 
That guy had a mom, a family and friends. 
Oh, and a name. Not Skeletor- - it's Roger Workman. 
It's work man, you blockhead. 
That's his job. 
He was a Dharma janitor. 
Yeah, well you should still respect the dead. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Can you fix it? 
No. No fix. 
But you have to. 
I mean, can't you try, dude? 
I mean, we gotta get this running. 
Hey, leave the man alone. 
He's right." No fix." 
Take a look at that mess. 
There's no way it's gonna get running. 
- How thick are you? 
- What's your problem, man? 
Why don't you want this to work? 
I don't care if it works. 
Why is it so important to you? 
Because we could all use a little hope. 
If it's hope you're looking for, ese, you're on the wrong damn island... 
'Cause there sure as hell ain't no hope here. 
Come on, Hugo, time to get up. 
Come on! 
Rise and shine. Hit the deck. 
Come on, we're burning daylight. 
Let's go. 
- What's with the earphones? 
- It's for the noise. 
Oh, well, your mother's a very passionate woman. 
That is disgusting. 
Come on. We're going on an adventure. 
Let's go. I'm not going anywhere with you. 
Look, just do this one thing with me. 
If it doesn't work, you can go to Australia. 
I won't stop you. Okay? 
What one thing? 
We're gonna break the curse. 
- This is stupid. 
- Just give her a chance, man. 
Cut the deck, please. 
You've recently come into a great deal of money. 
Could've seen that on the news. 
But it hasn't brought you happiness. 
No, it's brought you great misfortune. 
Hmm. She didn't see that on the news. 
I'm seeing numbers. 
What numbers? 
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. 
There's darkness around these numbers... great tragedy. 
I'm... I'm sorry. 
What? 
What is it? 
Death... surrounds you... and more is coming. 
Your hands, please. 
There's a curse on you... but it can be removed. 
Now, Hugo, I need you to remove your clothes. 
My clothes? 
A curse is like an unwelcome entity that lives inside you, and it must be exorcised. 
Did my dad put you up to this? 
- What? 
- Hugo, please. 
I'll give you $ 1,000 right now if you admit that my dad told you to say this stuff. 
The mystic arts are not subject to bribes. 
How dare you- $ 10,000. 
- Your dad put me up to it. 
I was just trying to help. 
Help who? 
Beer. 
Beer. 
Bingo. 
Beautiful. 
Car. 
Car. 
Okay. 
International house of pancakes. 
What are you doing over there? 
- I'm praying. 
- Praying for what? 
Help. 
Well, hell, I got you a little help right here. 
Dude! 
Hey, dude. Stop moping. 
Come on. 
I'm not moping. 
I'm thinking. 
When people stare out at the ocean and get all quiet-like, they're moping. 
So get up and come with me. 
That car I found- - we're getting it running. 
What's the point? 
- Ow! 
What did you do that for? - Snap out of it. 
Stop feeling sorry for yourself'cause someone said you're gonna die. 
I got an idea that's gonna help us both. 
Now... it is dangerous, and there's a very good chance that you will die. 
This is supposed to convince me to come with you? 
It is,' cause if you don't die, then we win. 
Win? 
Look, I don't know about you, but things have really sucked for me lately, and I could really use a victory. 
So let's get one, dude. 
Let's get this car started. 
Let's look death in the face and say," whatever, man." 
Let's make our own luck. 
What do you say? 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. 
Okay, nice. 
Keep it coming. 
Uh... you... were... right. 
Okay. 
That's two. 
Those pants don't make you look fat. 
Now you got it- - the only three things a woman needs to hear. 
Come on, get up. 
We got work to do. 
What's your problem, Jumbotron? 
Shut up, red... neck... man. 
Touche. 
What's Jiminy Cricket doing here? 
- We need another man. 
- Another man for what? 
To push this car, dude. 
Push it? 
Push it where? 
Hey! Aah! 
Oh, this is gonna be real good. 
So you're going to Australia, huh? 
Long way to go' cause some stupid numbers- - 
I'd really like you to leave. 
When your mom called me about the lottery, 
I was on my bike before she could hang the phone up. 
I'm getting old. 
Yeah, I saw my retirement. 
You're right. 
I'm here for the money. 
Well, you're not getting any of it. 
Well, that's not why I'm here talking to you now. 
I'm here talking to you now because going to Australia's not gonna break any curse. 
You don't need to leave. 
You just... 
you need a little hope. 
We make our own luck, Hugo. 
You know what I think you should do? 
What? 
I think you should give away the money- - all of it, every penny. 
Just save enough for a... a carburetor. 
Work on the Camaro, you know, just you and me. 
Take it off the blocks and make that road trip to the Grand Canyon. 
Never too late for a fresh start. 
I'll send you a postcard from Sydney. 
Hey... 
I'll be here when you get back. 
Are you nuts? 
You're not gonna drive down that. 
We're gonna jump-start it. 
You guys are gonna push it, and then on the way down, 
I'm gonna pop the clutch and get it started. 
You see those rocks? 
All you're gonna do is crash into those real fast, if you don't roll over first. 
Hurley, no. 
Dudes, I know how to drive. 
Now come on. 
Just push me. 
This will work. 
I know it. 
And what are you out here for- - watch him crash and burn? 
I came to ride shotgun. 
Well, it's your funeral. 
Come on. 
Let's give' em their ride. 
Are you sure you want to do this? 
Victory or death. 
Push! 
- Whoa, jeez! - Careful now. 
Now would be a good time, Hurley. 
Like right now! 
There is no curse. 
You make your own luck. 
You make your own luck. 
There is no curse! 
Son of a bitch. 
Come on, come on! 
Get in here. 
All right, come on! 
Kate, if you were looking for help to find Jack, why didn't you ask us? 
Two reasons- - you don't know where to look, and you're not motivated. 
And I don't blame you. 
Why would you want to go on another trek across the island, risk more lives just to get Jack back? 
You're wrong. 
Oh, really? Then why didn't you come after- - 
Not about the motivation, just about knowing where to look. 
We got a compass bearing, and I'm pretty sure if we follow it, it'll lead us right to him. 
How? Because of the way the sunlight hit Mr. Eko's stick when john was burying him. 
So now you know our secret. 
How about you tell us yours? 
No! 
Don't shoot! 
It's all right! 
It's safe! We're just here to talk! 
You can come out! 
What are you doing here? 
I came to ask for your help. 
To do what? 
I'm heading to the Others' camp, and if I'm gonna find it, 
I need someone who knows the island. 
What makes you think I have an interest in helping you? 
Because they had me, and they would have never let me go. 
They probably would've killed me if I hadn't escaped. 
And the girl who helped me escape... she was about 16 years old. 
And her name was Alex. 
I'm pretty sure that she's your daughter. 
Previously on One Tree Hill... 
This is the first draft to a novel I'm writing. 
Who knew? 
No one. 
I could pass calculus in my sleep. 
You're the one flunking out. 
This is the key to the cabinet with the answers. 
Got it. 
My mom tried to kill herself. 
I felt relieved, like maybe it was for the best. 
Have you guys met Chase? 
He's our newest Clean Teen, virgins for life. 
Hi. 
Brooke Davis - 
- Clean Teen. 
I'm kind of afraid of being here with you. 
- Why? - You're hot. 
Open your eyes, Luke. 
I saw Jimmy lying on the floor dead and Keith was standing above him. 
Jimmy didn't kill Keith. Lucas said something really unsettling today. 
What did he say? 
He said he doesn't think that Jimmy Edwards killed Keith. 
Do you ever wonder if we make the moments in our lives or if the moments in our lives make us? 
Nice shot. - Can you say merry Christmas? 
- Merry Christmas. 
It's amazing how fast they grow up, isn't it? 
Keith bought me that bike. 
Hey, mom. Don't forget. I got to get fitted for my tux today. 
Right, the prom. 
You come by the café, and we'll go take a look this afternoon. 
All right. 
How's he doing? 
I mean, with this notion about Keith not being taken by the Edwards kid? 
I think he just needs to believe in it somehow. 
Let me take him shopping this afternoon for the tux. 
I've missed enough important moments in his life. 
I'd like to do something about that. 
Please? 
Hey, Glenda. 
Hi. 
Oh, you remember Peyton, right? 
Yeah, sure - - the loner. 
Loner cheerleader. 
I really liked the picture you took of Lucas. 
The eye shadow was a little Fall Out Boy, though. 
So, Lucas, that book that you loaned me, 
I'm just in chapter 10, but I'd love to talk to you about it. 
Yeah. Good, no, anytime. 
Okay. 
Bye. 
- What book? 
- Oh, I, um - - 
I loaned her a copy of" The Great Gatsby." 
She's never read it. Can you believe that? 
I took her for more of an Edgar Allan Poe kind of girl. 
We should slow down. 
It feels like just the right speed to me. 
Really... 
I have to go. 
Saved by the bell. 
Hey. 
I got to ask you something, and I really don't want you to get pissed off, but I have to ask you. 
Okay. It's about the stolen test. 
You were failing calculus, and then you just got an" A" on the last test. 
Just tell me it's a coincidence. 
It was a coincidence. 
- Seriously, Brooke. 
- Yeah. 
I know I have to pass the class to graduate, and you were busy tutoring Rachel, so I just got help from Chase instead. 
Really? 
Okay. Sorry. 
Principal Turner's just really pissed right now, he's on a major witch hunt. 
You should probably know you're, like, the prime suspect. 
It wasn't me. 
Scout's honor. Okay. 
Why the long face? 
You know what today is. 
No, but I'm sure you're about to enlighten me. 
Come on. 
You've got three weeks of sobriety. 
It's the first day you can have visitors. It's a good day. 
After the way I behaved, no one is coming for me. 
Trust me. 
Hey, don't be so sure. 
Sometimes... people can surprise you. 
Are you on drugs? 
! You're not turning yourself in. 
I just had to lie to Haley. Turner is closing in, and I am stupid. 
Brooke, they don't have any proof. 
There's no use to this. I'm going to turn myself in. 
Fine. Whatever. 
Before you turn yourself in... you might want to take a look at this. 
It came for you this morning. 
Oh, my god. 
Victoria's Secret wants to franchise Clothes Over Bro's for their pink fashion line. 
I-I'm going to be in stores everywhere! 
Maybe not. 
Look at paragraph 14. 
So I like reading your mail. It's a guilty pleasure. 
The contract has a morality clause. 
That means they want student-council president Brooke Davis, not" I cheated in calculus" Brooke Davis. 
I don't think an expelled high-school student exactly fits the Victoria's Secret profile. 
What am I going to do? 
Nothing. 
Brooke, trust me. 
There's nothing they can do to prove you cheated on the test. 
As some of you may know, it has come to my attention that one of you cheated on the last exam. 
So today we're all going to take a little pop quiz. 
And I assure you, when I discover who that cheater is, they will be dealt with in the harshest possible way. 
Didn't see that one coming. 
So, I was thinking we would get a limo for prom. 
I talked to Brooke, and she and Chase want to share. 
Mouth, can I talk to you for a minute? 
I don't think I can do this. What" this"? 
Us. 
I think maybe it's not such a good idea that we're dating. 
It's about them, isn't it? 
The Clean Teens. 
It's more complicated that. 
Explain it to me' cause I'm pretty good with complicated. 
I can't go out with you. 
Okay, so, we're not dating, but we're - - we're still going to prom, right? 
I don't think prom would be such a good idea, either. 
This was... 
This was a mistake. I'm sorry. 
Maybe you passed the test this time. 
I mean, stranger things have happened... like Brooke Davis is dating a Clean Teen. 
Maybe. 
And it didn't feel that bad. 
Oh, who am I kidding? 
There's no way I passed that test. 
Brooke, this could be the chance that you need to start over. 
Think about it. If you pass this time, you did it all on your own. 
Yeah, and if I didn't pass, I'm going to get expelled from school, and my life as I know it is over. 
Well, I believe in you. 
Brooke Davis, please report to the principal's office immediately. 
Well, okay, then. 
Dead girl kissing. 
- Good luck. 
- Thanks. 
Nice fit for a rental. 
What are you - - 42 regular? 
Yeah. Not bad. 
The trick with formal wear is to always go classic. 
You don't want to be that guy looking back 20 years from now regretting the blue ruffles. 
Mmm, yeah, right. 
What did you wear to prom? 
Blue ruffles. 
Hey, Lucas, I know it's been hard for you without Keith around, and your mother told me what you said about Jimmy Edwards. 
And I just want you to know that... you may not be wrong in what you're thinking. 
You don't think Jimmy killed Keith? 
Not exactly. 
What I mean is, I know you and Jimmy were friends, and maybe you're right. 
Maybe Jimmy didn't mean to kill Keith. 
Maybe what happened in that hallway was a terrible accident. 
But the truth is... we'll never know. 
So I need to ask you a favor, Lucas. 
I need you to stop and consider your mother's feelings. 
Because although she'll never admit it, all this talk is breaking her up on the inside. 
So you got to let it go... for her sake. 
How we doing, gentlemen? 
Fine, thanks. 
We're going to take this Armani. 
Sorry, sir. The Armani is only available for purchase. I'm aware of that, Slick. 
We'll take the Armani. 
You're buying me a tuxedo? 
Every man should own his own tuxedo. 
And every father should know what it feels like to buy one for his son. 
Nathan. 
Hi. 
I-I-I wasn't sure you'd want to see me. 
To be honest, I wasn't sure I was coming. 
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. 
Suicide - - nice one, mom. 
And thanks for the note, by the way. 
Please, Nathan, don't. 
You can't begin to understand this disease. 
" Disease"? 
Is that what you're calling it now? 
Peyton's mom, Ellie, had a disease. 
Cancer - - that's a disease, mom. 
What you have is a weakness. 
And when the hell are you going to start fighting it? 
I know. 
I know I've been weak. 
But I... 
- I'm scared. 
- Of what? 
Your - - Your terrible life in that big, expensive house? 
'Cause I'm not seeing it, mom. 
What are you so scared of? 
Myself. 
It's easy in here. I-I have a support team to stay sober. 
But out there, alone... 
I'm not sure I can trust myself. 
Mom... you better figure it out. 
Because if things don't change soon, you're not going to have anything to come home to. 
Thanks. 
It's pretty cool. I think Peyton really going to love it. 
You're welcome. 
So, Peyton, huh? Yeah. 
Well, have a good time, senior state champ. 
It's a good time to be alive. 
By the way, the state championship... 
You didn't take your HCM medication, did you? 
Why would you say that? 
Because I take those pills, Lucas. 
We have the same condition. 
You can fool other people, but you can't fool me. 
Well, it'll be our secret. 
Just promise me you won't do anything that stupid again, okay? 
Your mom's already been through enough. 
She needs you healthy and in one piece. 
- Hey. - Hey. 
There you guys are. What took you so long? 
Well, we decided to turn a rental into a purchase. 
I know I should have cleared it with you first, but... I couldn't help myself. 
His idea. 
Um, Dan, we need to - - we need to talk about this. 
Talk about what? 
You and him - - all of this, everything. 
Okay. How about dinner? 
I'll pick you up around 7 : 00. 
That sounds like a date. 
No, no date... 
Just dinner. 
Ah, miss Davis. 
It's about your calculus exam. 
It seems I owe you an apology. 
I passed the test! 
Turner just apologized. 
I guess all my studying paid off. 
Congratulations. 
Now you're free to be Victoria's Secret's next big thing. 
Okay, you are good with all this legal mumbo jumbo, so, what do I do next? 
Um, it seems pretty basic. 
In addition to your designs, you just have to turn over the artwork, and you're good to go. 
Artwork? 
Hey, principal Turner. You wanted to see me? Yes. 
Please have a seat, Haley. 
We've discovered who stole the calculus exam, and, unfortunately, it's someone you know. 
Rachel Gatina. 
It's not - - are you sure it's Rachel? 
Well, I've spoken to miss Gatina. 
I'm quite sure. 
Haley, you were tutoring her, and I'm afraid I have no choice but to ask you to resign your position at the tutor center effective immediatly. 
- No, look, principal Turner - - 
- My decision is final. 
I'll need your key. 
I'm sorry it came to this, Haley. 
Word of advice? I might take a good look at who your real friends are. 
What do you mean you got fired? 
It was Rachel. 
I was right about her all along. 
She was the one that stole the exam, and because I was tutoring her, they let me go. 
Bitch. But you had nothing to do with it. 
Didn't you just tell principal Turner? Yeah, I did. 
I told him, and he said," it's school policy." 
It just really sucks. I love tutoring, and we really needed that extra money. 
I'm so sorry, Haley. 
I know I went to bat for her. I knew it. 
I knew I was right about her. 
I'm sorry. 
Look, it's not your fault. 
I know you were just trying to help her and just trying to... be a good guy. 
That's what I love about you. 
I don't feel like such a good guy right now. 
Why? 
I went to see my mom this morning, and, uh, I think I was kind of hard on her. 
Babe, if anybody's in need of tough love, it's your mom. 
I know, but... she's going to be released in a few days, and she told me that she's scared to be alone in the house. 
She's going to slip, Haley. 
I can feel it. 
Well, why don't we do something about it? 
Like what? 
I don't know. We need to save money. She needs help. 
We could... let the apartment go and move into her house. 
Yeah, look. 
It would be perfect. We'd save money, and we'd be there to watch her 24 / 7, and everybody wins. 
And Peyton thinks I'm a martyr. 
Come on, she's - - you know, she's your family. 
She's a train wreck, but she's your mom. 
You'd do that for her? 
No, but I'd do that for you. 
Okay. My mom gets home in a few days, and I need this house to be completely drug-and alcohol-free. 
Let's fan out. 
Dude, it's just Nathan's mom. 
How much booze could we possibly be talking about? 
Damn. 
Nate mom like the alcoholic easter bunny. 
Are we really going to dump it all? 
Hold on a second. 
It's friday. Prom's tomorrow night. We got a ton of booze, a huge house, and we just won a state championship. 
I like the way you think, dawg. 
With a crib like this, a brother could definitely get hooked up, especially if he got him a new shortie with some hot leather pants. 
You feeling me, Mouth? 
Yeah, but I don't think she is. 
What you working on? 
Look, um... 
I got to be honest. 
Today I kind of lied to you. 
The book that I gave Glenda wasn't" The Gatsby." 
It's one I've been writing. 
And I needed an impartial opinion, so I gave it to her. 
I know there's no 10th chapter in" Gatsby." 
But thank you for telling me the truth. 
I'm sorry. 
I guess I'm just worried it's not going to be good. 
Well, what about me? 
I can be impartial. 
- I don't think so. 
- Why? ! Because you're in it. 
- Give me that book right now. 
- No way. 
- Please! 
- It's not ready. 
Pretty please with... me on top? 
Well, I can... be persuaded. 
Okay, no. 
Okay, stop, stop, stop. I don't think so. 
Oh, come on. 
I'll let you read the first six chapters of my book. 
That's very sexy, um, but I just want our first time to be special. 
And right now it's really not with... nationals CD wedged underneath my back... which is a very good album, by the way. 
Plus, your mom's going to come in any second. 
She's working at the café. Nobody's going to walk in. 
Okay, my discomfort meter is pretty much pegged. 
Hi. Sorry. 
Luke, can I talk to Peyton for a sec? 
Sure. 
Just, um, you know, if you guys get into it, try not to break anything expensive. 
For the record, I didn't come here to fight. 
Victoria's Secret has offered to franchise Clothes Over Bro's. 
So it's a really big, huge deal for me, but I can't move forward with it unless you're willing to sign off on your artwork. 
So... 
I just need to know what you need from me to make this work. 
You have a pen? 
What are you doing? 
I'm signing over the artwork to you. 
They're just sketches, Brooke. You're the one that turned them into Clothes Over Bro's. 
Congratulations, Brooke. 
Are you sure you're comfortable with this? 
Sure. 
I'm happy for you. 
You know I love him. 
I really do. 
But I never meant for my love for him to hurt you. 
Thank you, Peyton. 
Um, Nathan, what is going on? 
Well, we never really got a chance to celebrate winning state, and I figured with everything that's been going on lately, it might be nice to kick off prom and have a little... 
- Party! - Party! 
Don't look now, Mouth, but Shelly all up in here right now. 
12 : 00 and closing fast. 
Okay, on the count of three, we are out of here. 
Ready? Three. 
Is this how it's going to be? 
You're just going to ignore me? 
Let me guess. 
You're here to tell me you want to be friends. 
I get it, Shelly. 
You're not attracted to me. It's not that. 
It is just the opposite. 
It's because I am attracted to you, Mouth. 
I'm just not sure I trust myself to be with you. 
Let me get this straight. 
You broke up with me the day before prom because you're so attracted to me? 
Okay, I think I really need a drink. 
Dan, this feels like a date. 
Let's just call it the mayor and almost-mayor having dinner. 
Karen, I want to start being a bigger part of Lucas' life. 
He needs a father, and I... 
I want to be that father to him, regardless of what's happening between us. 
I'm pregnant with your brother's child. 
There's nothing happening between us. 
You're also alone. 
And if you need anything, and I mean anything at all, 
I want to be the man that you turn to. 
Luke, you got to help me find some booze, man. It's going to get ugly down there. 
You got to let this go, man. 
Keith's gone, Luke. 
Jimmy's gone. 
Nothing's going to bring them back. 
But... you got a ton of people that love you out there, and in a few months, most of those people are going to go their separate ways. 
So, what do you say, big brother? 
Let's have some fun. 
- Hey. 
- Hey. Oh, hey. 
I wanted to say congratulations on your calculus test. Turner told me. 
I am really sorry about this morning. 
I should never have doubted you. 
I never doubted her for a second. 
You should be really proud of yourself, Brooke. 
Well, as tempting as it was to be senior for another year, I figured it was probably time for me to graduate. 
Um, have you guys seen Rachel? 
She was holding court in the living room. 
Clothed or unclothed? 
Clothed, but it was about 10 minutes ago, so you never know. 
So, we were in the chapter where you take your girlfriend up to that empty bedroom at the party. 
I think I may need to do a little research first. 
I was hoping you'd say that. 
Thank you, thank you. 
Tip your waitresses. Or me. 
So, how'd you do it, Rachel? 
- Do what? 
- Don't throw dumb-ass at me, girly. 
You stole that test, and I want to know how you did it. 
Did you steal my key while I was in the hospital? 
Yeah, I bet you did, didn't you? 
You know, I could have spent my time tutoring someone that actually needed it, and now I'm not going to have that opportunity again, thanks to you. 
- Whatever. - So... 
That is for getting me fired. 
And that is for trying to sleep with my husband. 
Bitch, you are lucky you're pregnant. 
Honey, you're lucky that I'm pregnant. 
I think it's time you get your insecure, cheating skank ass out of this house right now. 
You bit- - 
Yo, I think it's time for you to leave. 
Told you I got the kid's back. 
Rachel, wait. 
What the hell was that? 
What did you do to piss off Haley? 
It was the exam. 
Haley found out I stole it and... they fired her. 
Guess I didn't see that one coming, either. 
But how? 
We both passed the retest. 
Not exactly, Copernicus. 
Only one of us did. 
Why would you do that? 
Victoria's Secret, Brooke... 
The morals clause. 
Besides, I figured I got you into this, so... I wanted to get you out. 
You're my friend, Brooke. 
What are they going to do to you now? 
Who knows? 
We'll see. 
Brooke, it's okay. 
I'll be fine. 
I'm going to take off. 
Go back in and hang with Chase. 
I'll catch up with you at home. 
Rachel... 
Thank you. 
Haley. I heard you were fighting Rachel. 
You punched her? 
It was more of a bitch-slap. 
Yeah, that was after she threw the drink on her. 
I'm okay. 
Don't worry about me. 
I feel fi- - 
What is it? Are you okay? 
Yeah, the baby's just really kicking. 
It's kicking? 
Oh, yeah. 
I feel it. 
That's our boy. 
Mouth... 
Are you okay? 
No. 
I know it's my fault. 
I'm sorry. 
It's just hard, you know? 
I look at you, and it hurts so much to know that we can't be together. - I know you're a Clean Teen, Shelly, but what do you want me to say? - Mouth. 
That I don't want to sleep with you? 
That I don't want my first time to be with you? 
Well, I can't say that'cause that would be a lie. 
From the moment I saw you, I was hooked. 
And I got to look into those beautiful eyes and kiss you, and now that's all I want to do. 
I could kiss you forever. 
And I know I'm not good enough. 
So, is this where tomorrow night's prom queen is hanging out? 
What's up? 
I'm just worried about Rachel. 
That's my girl. 
There's a raging party going on, and you're worried about a friend. 
You're a good person, Brooke Davis. You think so? 
I've done some things I'm really not proud of. 
You're a good person. 
You sure? 
I'm sure. 
Does that mean you want to kiss me some more? 
Old school Nathan in the house. 
Scott - 
- Nathan Scott. 
That's my baby. 
Oh, snap! 
I thought you and Nathan were married. 
Shelly, are you okay? 
I mean, was that okay? 
Yeah, I-I just got to find my shirt. 
Aw, my bad. 
Nice work, though! 
Shelly... 
Hey, hey, don't cry. 
Skills won't tell anyone. 
I promise. 
You don't understand. 
I got to go. 
But tonight, this, I mean... this was the start of something really good. 
This was the start of us. 
Can't you feel that? 
I'm a Clean Teen. 
I'm the Clean Teen. 
I could love you. 
I know I could. 
But I can't. 
Then what was this? 
This was goodbye. 
Shelly, please don't go. 
Mouth, don't call me. 
If you really like me, just... let me go. 
Thanks for a great evening. Oh, and thanks for letting Lucas keep the tux. 
Oh, well, uh, I had him try it on. 
It looks good on him. 
It's better than those blue ruffles. 
Um, you know... 
I'm chaperoning at the prom. 
They still need a couple parents. 
You're asking me to the prom? 
Yeah, I guess I am. 
Okay. 
I thought you said you wanted to wait. 
Do you remember what you said the last time we were here? 
You said you wanted it all, and... 
I walked away. 
I made a big mistake that night'cause all I wanted was sex. 
What do you want now? 
Now I want what you wanted. I want everything with you. 
There he is. 
Big night, dawg, big night! 
So, how you feel? 
Well, I lost my virginity, my prom date, and a girl I really could have loved... all in one night. 
To tell you the truth, Skills... 
I never felt worse. 
Where's the new boyfriend? Taking a break. 
When all you do is kiss, you got to come up for air once in a while. 
Well, he seems like a really good guy - - Chase. 
Yeah, he is. 
I really like him. 
Good. 
Listen, I'm really sorry about Haley and the whole tutor-center thing. 
Don't be sorry. 
It's not like it was your fault. 
Yeah. 
So, how come you're not in there enjoying your big party? 
Well, Skills broke out the old Ravens' game footage. 
I swear, when I watch it, it doesn't even feel like me. 
I should hope not. 
You were such a jerk! 
You were dating Peyton, and you guys fought all the time. 
Hey, look who's talking. 
Are you ever going to let Peyton off the mat? 
Yeah. 
I guess it's about time, isn't it? 
Yeah, actually, it is. 
Don't move. Why? 
Nathan, what - - what's going on? 
The sprinklers. 
What? ! 
You think you're funny? You are so dead! 
Oh, I got you, I got you, I got you. 
If you could go back and change just one thing about your life, would you? 
And if you did... would that change make your life better? 
Or would that change ultimately break your heart? 
Or break the heart of another? 
Would you choose an entirely different path? 
Or would you change just one thing? 
Just one moment? 
One moment that you always wanted back? 
Oh, my god. 
Is that Nathan? ! 
Is that Haley? ! 
I think it's Peyton. 
What's going on out there? 
Dude, you got to see this! 
There's a tape of Peyton having sex with Nathan! 
Oh, my god! 
Shut it off! 
Shut it off! 
I can't believe I'm doing this. 
Don't worry. 
Nobody will ever know. 
NARRATOR : 
Previously on Las Vegas. No, I was thinking about more like kidnapping and robbery. 
Daddy! 
Delinda! Please help me! 
( sighing ) Said something about a monster whale coming in tonight. 
Mr. Peterson. 
Yes. Sam Marquez from the Montecito. 
They want you to testify against your father. 
She was always lucky to have a friend like you. 
He got off. 
I told you if you ever came near her again, I would kill you. 
How much for that.38? 
I'm looking for Wallace. 
Why you calling on me? 
I need information. 
What do I get out of it? I could owe you. 
Casey's dead. 
It seems he's left you the hotel and casino. 
You own the Montecito. 
SAM : As the new owner of the Montecito, 
I want to make some changes around here. 
Whatever it costs doesn't matter. 
I want new carpets everywhere, no reds, no greens. 
Green reminds people that they're losing money and I lost my virginity in the backseat of Nick Steinbach's car. 
That red Pinto. 
But he was hot. 
Sam. 
Wait there. 
Hello, Mr. Peterson. 
Hello, Sam. 
You get my flowers? 
I did, and the car, and the necklace and the room key. 
Marry me right now, Sam. 
I'll make you the happiest woman in the world. 
How much have you lost? 
Just under two million. 
Ask me again at five. 
Hmm. How about dinner tonight? 
A cocktail? 
Always keep them begging for more. 
Mmm-hmm. Write that down. 
I want new felt on all of these tabletops. 
Gold. 
Maybe with a picture of my dog Reggie. 
And I want a new design on all of these casino chips. 
Oh, how about putting an" S" on all of the chips? 
For Sam. 
That's a great idea. 
Give yourself a raise. 
Thanks. 
I'm kidding. 
You're fired. 
What? I'm just wielding my power. 
Play along. 
Danny, Mike, I want all the employees to salute me whenever they see me on the casino floor. 
Can you see to that? 
Salute you? 
Yeah. Or the boys can salute me and the girls can curtsy. 
Like that. 
Uh, I don't think that I can... 
I'm just kidding. 
I think. 
I don't know yet. 
Is this fun or what? 
It is, I think. 
Anyways, I'll see you guys later. 
Hey, could you guys find out how much it's going to cost to change that big sign out front from" The Montecito" 
to" The Samecito"? 
You write that down? 
" The Samecito"? 
Yeah, she's just drunk with power. 
She'll sober up in a few days. 
If not we may have to enroll her in" a pain in my ass" anonymous. 
Hey, what are you and Delinda doing tonight for dinner? 
Uh... 
We don't have any plans. 
Why? I need a wingman. 
More like a wing couple. 
I got an old family friend in town for a couple of days and my Aunt Gladys told her I'd take her to dinner while she was here. 
Why do you need me and Delinda? 
Well, I haven't seen her in like 20 years and last time I saw her... 
Ah. You slept with her. 
No. No, no, nothing like that. 
Then what? 
Well... ( sighing ) 
What? 
Let's just say, uh... ( MURMURlNG ) She beat me up. 
She what? 
She beat me up. 
The great Mike Cannon got his ass kicked by a girl? 
Not just any girl. Julia Thomas, this girl was big... 
Iron Mike Cannon? 
Would you keep it down, man? 
I got to meet this girl. 
What the hell happened between you two? 
Well, she said I had a peanut head. 
So I told her... 
Ooh. 
Well, that's just not cool. 
You don't say that to girls. I know this now. 
So, when I woke up, all the kids in the neighborhood were laughing at me. 
When you woke up? 
She... She knocked you out? 
Yes. 
She knocked you out? 
Yeah. 
It was a lucky punch. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. 
You know, don't worry about it. We'll, we'll go to dinner with you. 
Cool. 
Thanks, and uh... 
You'll keep this between us? 
Of course. 
Absolutely, why would I say something like that? 
Thank you. 
It's embarrassing. 
Great. Thanks, Danny. 
Mike Cannon, a.k.a." Peanut Head", got his ass kicked by a girl! 
Ah! Yeah, well... 
I not a kid anymore. 
I'm a grown man. I got a beautiful head. 
( CROWD chattering ) I got a nice head. 
SAM : You're late. 
Sorry, I'm what? 
Late. 
Sam, get out of my chair. 
Now, if I own the hotel, isn't this really my chair? 
Three... 
Two... 
I can get my own chair. 
Sam? 
What, uh, exactly are you doing here? 
Well, if I'm going to take the Sam... 
If we're going to take the Montecito to the next level, well, don't you think that I should be more integral in the day-to-day operations? 
Integral? Hmm. 
I see. 
Let me explain something to you, Sam. 
Uh, casino owners do not run casinos. 
Casino Presidents run casinos, because it takes experience, skill. 
Relationships, that's what makes a casino work and that's what I do. 
That's what you do? 
Yes. Yes, it is. 
And you... 
You lure rich suckers into the casino to lose millions of dollars. 
So, you continue to do that. 
And now if you'll excuse me, I've got a lot of work to do. 
This conversation is not over. 
Yes, it is. 
I want you to start wearing suits. 
New policy. 
Get out. 
I'm going to get you a timecard. 
This conversation's not over. 
What are you eating? 
I know what you're thinking. 
It looks like a corndog, but it's not. 
It's a corn burger. 
With chili and cheese I think. 
It's fantastic. You want to try? 
Uh, no. 
You don't know what you're missing. 
Yeah, I think I do. 
Honey, listen. Has your dad said anything to you? 
About what? 
Retiring. 
No! 
And he never will, I mean he doesn't know how do to anything but work. 
Oh, you want him to retire. 
Don't you think it's my turn to do what I want to do? 
I've earned that, right? 
Of course, Mom, but Daddy's never going to leave here. 
Anyhoo, I got to run. 
I'm going to surprise Danny with lunch. 
Good luck. 
Hey. Oh! 
Hey. Danny. 
You okay? 
Yeah, I'm fine. 
I'm just a little... 
Fine. 
What's up? 
I just thought you were going to take a few days off. 
Spend it with your sisters. 
Yeah, it's my own fault. 
I booked, uh, two conventions in the same ballroom at the same time. 
The meat packers, and the, uh... ( MOANlNG ) 
Ah! Meat and magic under one roof. 
As it should be. 
Yeah. Yeah, I, I can't believe I double booked. You know? 
I don't know where my head's been lately. 
You're just under a lot of stress right now. 
Everything's going to be great. 
I promise. 
Mmm-hmm. Okay. 
You let me know if there's anything I can do? 
I'm fine. 
I know you're fine. 
Okay, I got to go. 
Uh-huh. 
Hey! What? 
I thought that you had the day off. 
What are you doing here? 
Did you just have a corndog? 
Corn burger. 
They're awesome. Ah. 
Anyway, I was just out shopping with my mom and she wanted to come by and talk to my dad so I thought I would surprise you by bringing you lunch. 
Corn bacon? 
No. 
And thank you very much. 
I got you the Miller sandwich from Canter's. 
The Miller? 
Beautiful! 
Thank you. 
Oh, uh, we're going to dinner tonight with Mikey if that's cool. 
What's the occasion? 
You're not going to believe this, but... 
No. 
No. 
I'm not kidding you. 
You told her. 
You told her. Huh? 
Told her what? 
About Julia. 
No. I told her about dinner. 
Hey, sorry. 
What time? 
8 : 30. 
Oh, good. 
I'll see you at home. 
Later, Peanut Head. 
I... She guessed that. 
Who guesses Peanut Head? 
So what's going on? 
Are we hiring some new security staff? 
Uh, not that I know of. 
Well, there's a couple brothers waiting for you upstairs. 
Real gangster types. 
They said they had an interview with you. 
That's news to me. 
I'll take care of it. 
You want me up there? 
No. 
No, no, no, but if you could give me Julia's number in case I need her to knock somebody out for me, that would be great. 
That's cold, man. 
It's only going to get colder. 
What are you doing here? 
Shopping with Delinda and I just thought I'd stop in and say hi. 
Really. 
Okay. 
So, uh, what did I do? 
Nothing. 
Is this about the hair in the shower drain. 
Because if it is, I told you a hundred times there's nothing I can do about that. 
My father happened to be a very hairy guy and it's a gene thing. 
So, I mean, blame it on my father. 
Ed, it's not about hair in drains. 
I just thought maybe we could have a nice conversation about our future. 
Our future? Mmm-hmm. 
Hey, fellas. 
Danny McCoy. 
They call me Piper. 
Nice to meet you. 
And this here's Little Kev. 
Little Kev. What can I do for you? 
Little Kev here needs a job. 
You see he just got out the pen and his punk-ass PO says he needs a job or he's going back. 
Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear about that, Little Kev. 
But, uh, why are you guys coming to me? 
Wallace said you could hook it up. 
He said you owe him. 
Wallace? 
So you guys work for Wallace? 
Little Kev is Wallace's cousin. 
Now, all he needs is one of those time cards you all work with. 
You'll get someone to punch him in and out every day. 
And if his PO calls, you just tell him everything's cool. 
Listen, guys, my hands are tied here. 
I can't just bring an ex-con on to work in a casino. 
I ain't going to be doing no work. 
Yeah, I get that, really, but there's nothing that I can do. 
The state has restrictions about hiring felons in casinos. 
I can't do it. 
Just tell Wallace it's got to be something else. 
I'm sorry. 
What... 
Wallace said you were straight. 
Ain't going to be happy to hear none of this. 
Let's bounce. 
Be seeing you soon, McCoy. 
Oh. One more. 
MAN 1 : Whoa, wait! 
Hold it. 
MAN 2 : Hey, you made it. 
WOMAN 1 : Oh, hey! Could you hold the elevator? 
MAN 3 : Thank you. 
MAN 4 : Hey, you got room for one more? 
I got to... I got to get out! 
Excuse me. 
Excuse me. 
Excuse me. 
Oh, my God. 
MAN : Let's go. 
Don't move, bitch. 
Please, please, just leave. 
Get the car. 
Now, you tell your boy that Wallace ain't no punk. 
And the next time 
ain't going to be so nice. 
You, uh, you okay? 
I, um... 
Freaked out a little on the elevator. 
That happens. 
You want to talk about it? 
Well... 
Hold on. 
It's Delinda. 
I'll call her back. 
Talk to me. 
This whole trial has brought everything back. 
And I can't shake him, my father. 
And every time somebody touches me... 
Anybody... 
I feel him touching me. 
And I can't stand it anymore. 
Maybe try talking to somebody. 
There's only one way I'll ever feel safe from him. 
Now, don't say that, Mary. 
I think that you should talk to somebody. 
I could make the appointment for you. 
Just tell me that you'll go. 
It's not going to help. 
I think that it will help. 
I'm afraid. 
Hey, have I not always been there for you? 
Always. 
That's right. 
Since we were kids. 
That's right. 
Hello. 
Well, just keep the kebab skewers away from the magicians and the rabbits away from the meat guys. 
I'll be right there. 
Meat packers and magicians are fighting for control of the ballroom. 
Naturally. 
So I got to go. 
Yeah, well, call me. 
We should talk more about this. 
Yeah. 
Thank you. 
All right. Bye bye. 
I knew you didn't come up here to say hi. 
I knew that. 
Ed, you've done your time here. 
And damn it, so have I! 
It's time to retire. 
Sam owns the Montecito now. 
Let her deal with the business. 
Are you nuts or something? 
I mean she'll turn this place into a toilet! 
No, she won't, Ed. 
Will you listen to me? 
I am sick of having dinner all alone. 
I am sick of sleeping on the couch and trying to figure out if you're going to come home or not. 
For God sakes, Ed, our daughter was kidnapped! 
Really? 
You don't think I know that? 
You don't think I'd rather play golf every day? 
Wake up late, come home early and be with my family? 
Then why don't you? 
Because this is... 
This is what I'm really good at. 
That's why. 
Hello. 
Delinda? 
What's the matter? 
What? 
Where's Danny? 
Okay, look, yeah, just stay where you are. 
I'll be right there. 
No, I'm coming. 
Just stay put. 
mike : Danny! 
Danny! 
Hey, what's up? 
Julia chasing you? 
It's Delinda. 
You've got to go home. 
She walked in on some guys robbing your place. 
You got to go. 
Why didn't... 
Damn it. 
Watch the floor. 
Yeah. 
Mike? 
Yeah, I'm Mike. 
Uh... What can I do to you? 
For you. Ha! 
What can I do for you? 
You don't recognize me. 
Julia. 
Julia Thomas? 
You look... ( JULlA giggling ) 
Wow. 
Well, you look pretty" wow" yourself, Mr. Mike Cannon. 
Well, can a girl get a hug hello? 
Yeah, yeah. 
How you been, stranger? 
Great. 
Again, wow. 
Thank you. 
How long are you in town? 
Just for tonight. 
Got to head to New York tomorrow for a shoot, but... 
You're a model? 
Photographer. 
But I'll take that compliment, thank you. 
Listen, I know our aunties got together and set up this dinner for us tonight but if it's something you're not into... 
No, no, no. 
No. I want to catch up. 
Yeah? 
Yeah. 
Good. 
Me too. 
What about 8 : 30? 
Meet me right here? 
All right. 8 : 30 then. 
Bye, Mike. 
Bye, Julia. 
Damn. 
What the... 
They're for you. 
What? 
The rose petals are for you. 
Follow them. 
What are you doing? 
Sam, I'm in love with you. 
My heart aches at the very thought of you. 
Well, maybe you just need an angioplasty? 
I don't care if you don't love me. 
You can learn. 
All I know is that I will die if I can't have you. 
So, please, make me happy. 
Oh... Make me complete. 
With all my heart. 
Right. 
It's just... Will you marry me? 
Is this real? 
Yeah. 
Perfect and flawless, just like you. 
I mean... 
What do you say? 
I just have to get to this meeting, so... 
Do you do you mind if I just hold onto this for a minute while I think about it? 
Take every second you need. 
Okay, I'm going to... I'll let you know. 
You're okay, honey. 
You're okay. 
We'll let you know the minute we hear anything, Mr. Deline. 
Yeah, thanks a lot, guys. 
Let us know if you need anything. 
Thanks again. 
Delinda! 
ED : Where the hell were you? 
Are you okay? 
I called you. 
Oh, she called you. 
I called. 
DANNY : Are you hurt? 
No. But she could have been. 
Where were you? 
I called and called and called you. 
Where were you? 
Baby, I'm so sorry. 
I... I turned my phone off. 
Mary needed to talk, and... 
You were with Mary? 
Yeah. 
She... 
She needed me to... 
I needed you. 
The only thing that matters right now is that you're okay. 
Do you know who did this? 
Listen, honey. There's a car waiting to take you and Mom to the house for a little while, okay? 
All right. I'm coming. 
No. 
Just give her some time. 
Ed, this is my house. 
You're not the burning bush in here. Okay? So just... 
Let's just go. 
Just let her go to a place that she knows is safe. 
ED : I'll catch up with you guys in a little while. 
jillian : Okay. 
It's okay. 
Who the hell is Wallace? 
It's a House of Grath 15-karat, flawless, princess-cut diamond set in platinum. 
The what? 
I don't know the origin of the stone. 
What am I? An expert? 
I just want to know how much it's worth. 
Really? 
Over two million! 
Thanks, Mario. 
Yeah. 
Sam, there are two gentleman here to see you. 
Oh, good. It's the upholsterers. 
Send them in. 
Anthony, show me. 
You're such a good boy. 
I need a massage later. 
Send them in. 
Hi. 
Great! It's about time. 
Okay, I know exactly what I want to do and I want you guys to write this down. 
You're not writing. Why aren't you writing? 
AGENT 1 : 
Miss Marquez, we're with the internal Revenue Service. 
Oh, those hookers were a business expense. 
I have the receipts. 
We're not here about that, ma'am. 
We're here to inform you that as the new owner of the Montecito, you have acquired certain debts accrued by the former owner, Mr. Casey Manning. 
Debts? 
What kind of debts? 
Well, Mr. Manning used the Montecito as collateral in a number of real estate and business transactions. 
He chose to defer paying taxes on those transactions until the 15th of this month. 
Okay, fine. So Casey owes taxes. 
What are we talking about? 
And now, since they're your holdings, with penalties and late fees, you owe the government No. The taxes are on his holdings. 
$ 241 million and change. 
$ 241 million? 
And change. 
If you are unable to pay these taxes within the next seven days, the irs will have no choice but to seize the Montecito and all the assets attached to it. 
AGENT 2 : If you have any questions, feel free to call us. 
We look forward to hearing from you. 
Have a nice day. 
Damn it, Casey! 
You mean to tell me you make a deal with this Vegas gang lord, you tell him," l owe you one," and then you stiff him? 
I was trying to save a friend's life. 
What about Delinda's? 
I never thought that it was... 
Well, that's your problem. 
You're not thinking a lot these days! 
You know what? Back off! 
I made a mistake and I'll... 
A mistake? 
She had a gun at her head! 
A gun at her head! 
She's barely getting over this kidnapping thing. 
No, no. No, no... And she had a gun at her head! 
She got kidnapped because of you, not because of me. 
Now, you've got to believe me when I tell you that there is nothing more important to me than your daughter's safety. 
Nothing. 
All right. 
Look, she's going to stay with us, for a little while until we can figure this thing out. 
No, Ed. 
No. 
Listen, I'm not... I'm not asking you, Danny. 
Now, tomorrow a bunch of guys are going to come over. 
They're going to wire this place for alarms. 
And then we'll talk after that. 
Well, I want to see her. 
No. 
Just go back to work and we'll talk tomorrow! 
Now, where can I get this Wallace guy? 
No. 
He's mine. 
Ed. 
I said that I got it. 
Do not disappoint me again. 
All this could be yours for only $ 241 million and change. 
MAN : Yes, Miss Marquez? 
Connect me to Vince Peterson's room please? 
He just checked out of his suite. 
He's what? 
He just checked out. 
Vince. 
Where are you going? 
I'm leaving. 
I can't take the pain of not having you anymore, Sam. Goodbye. 
No, no, no, no. 
Oh, don't leave. Listen. 
It just, uh... 
Takes me a while to warm up to people. 
Stay. 
Sam, you... 
You broke my heart. 
Goodbye. 
Vince. 
Wait. 
If I can't have you then I don't want this. 
Sam. 
Yes. 
I'll stay on one condition. 
What's that? 
You have dinner with me. 
I'd be honored. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
All right. 
julia : So Vegas... 
Yeah. 
So, I came back to Vegas and it just felt right. 
The excitement of it all. 
Felt like I belonged here. 
Well, it fits you. 
Thank you. 
You know, when you get some time off, you should come visit me in LA. 
I'd like that. Yeah. 
Me too. Yeah. 
So, Mr. Mike Cannon. Mmm. 
When did you get so fine? 
Me? 
Please. 
When did all of this happen? 
Well, I guess I just grew into my body. 
That is for sure. 
Here you go. 
For you. 
Thank you. 
So, would you like to? 
Like to what? 
Grow into this body? 
Check! 
ED : How's Delinda? 
She's sleeping. 
I don't want her going back to that condo. 
That's okay, honey. 
Look, I got security wiring that joint tomorrow like, 
like it was Fort Knox. 
I don't care. 
I want her here with us. 
Okay, look, it's been a really long day. 
Why don't you just get some sleep. 
We'll talk about it tomorrow. 
No, Ed. 
We're going to talk about it right now. 
All this crap. 
All of it, the kidnapping, the break-in, happens because of what you do, and who you are. 
What the hell are you talking about? 
" Who I am"? 
I mean, it's my fault? 
Yes, Ed. 
It's your fault. 
First the ClA, now this? 
I mean, why are we here? 
Answer me that. 
Why are we still in Vegas? 
It's our home. 
No, Ed. 
This is not a home. 
This is some kind of rest stop between you and that damn casino. 
Hey, what do you think I bust my ass for every single day? 
For you! 
And that" damn casino" didn't bother you too much when you got your cars and your clothes and the houses. 
Where do you think that crap comes from? 
None of that matters to me, Ed. 
You and Delinda. 
That's all I care about. 
What would you like me to do? 
I want you to leave that job, so we can leave this damn city behind and start over. 
I just can't do that. 
Where you going? 
I'm sleeping with Delinda. 
I'm tired of sleeping in that bed alone. 
That was incredible. 
I can't feel my feet. 
So how is it that a man as fine as you, and as sweet as you, managed to stay single all this time? 
Well, I guess I was always waiting for the right girl to come along. 
Oh, she came along all right. 
Twice. 
So, you think you got anything left in that cannon, 
Cannon? 
Oh, hell, yeah. 
Oh, yeah. 
That feels so good, Peanut Head. 
What? 
What's wrong? 
You just called me Peanut Head. 
So? 
Well, my head don't look like no damn peanut. 
Mmm, but it does. 
Well, what if I said your weave made you look like a ho? 
A ho? 
That's right, a ho. 
See, I'm not a little kid anymore. 
And I sure as hell ain't no damn peanut head. 
Is that what this is about, Mike? 
Some silly fight we had when we were kids? 
That you never apologized for. 
Know what, Julia? 
Maybe you should leave. 
Mike. 
My room. 
Fine, I'm gone. 
Mike. 
Mike, don't leave. 
Mike, I'm sorry. 
Sorry for what? 
I'm sorry for calling you Peanut Head. 
And I'm sorry for hitting you and I'm sorry for never saying sorry. 
But just so you know, 
I called you Peanut Head because I think your head is beautiful. 
And I hit you because I had the worst crush on you. 
And I never said sorry because you'd always run away from me. 
You think my head is beautiful? 
Uh-uh, I think it's perfect. 
You really had a crush on me? 
The worst. 
Still do. 
But if you ever call me a ho again, I'm going to knock your ass out. 
I didn't expect to see your ass around here any time soon. 
It's over. 
I want to hear you say it. 
Nothing's over till Wallace says it is. 
No, it's over. 
And hear this. 
Any of you guys come near my girlfriend again, 
I will kill all of you. 
So now you're coming down here making threats and such, huh? 
You got some giant, big balls on you, McCoy. 
You see, normally someone do me like you did, they don't wake up ever. 
And that goes for anybody in the house with them. 
I made an exception for you. 
But don't think for one moment that means it's over' cause you say. 
Then what makes it done? 
Say ten large. 
To the" United Negro Ain't Never Been To College" fund. 
You will not get a dime from me, dude. 
Or we could just beat you down. 
And that makes this done? 
That's what that makes it. 
Like I said, giant, big balls. 
Beat that ass. 
There are sensors on all the doors and windows that are monitored 24 hours a day by the Montecito. 
This is a GPS panic button. 
If at any time you think you need help, just press this button. 
We'll come to you no matter where you are. 
Okay. 
Any questions? 
No. 
If you need anything, you just call me. 
Thank you, Jack. 
You're welcome. 
Thanks. 
You changed the locks. 
Oh, my God, Danny, what happened to you? 
I had... ( coughing )... to take care of some unfinished business. 
Business? 
What the hell kind of business? 
Just... 
Are you okay? 
Yeah, yeah. 
What have you done? 
I'm going to call the doctor. 
No, no. 
Listen, D, I promise that I'm never going to let anything like that happen to you again. 
I love you and you're all that matters to me. 
I love you too. 
I hope so. 
I'm going to go call the doctor. 
Yeah. 
Please do. 
I'll be back in two weeks. 
Can't wait. 
Me neither. 
Is it me or do we have something here? 
We definitely have something here. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Okay. Two weeks. 
Yep. 
Hi. 
Hi. 
I'm here with a proposition. 
Uh... 
Not now, Sam. 
Oh, please just hear me out. 
I know I'm a smart businesswoman, but I'm also smart enough to know my limitations. 
So? 
Okay. So here it is. 
How would you like to be my copartner in the Montecito for only 300 million? 
Only 300 million? 
Yeah. 
It's a bargain. 
I mean this hotel and casino's worth at least ten times that amount. 
Right. 
I tell you what though. 
Why wouldn't I just wait a week until the irs seizes this place and then I can buy it in private auction for about half of what you're offering? 
Is that a no? 
Yeah. It's certainly not personal, Sam. 
Business. 
You know I'm not going to let the irs take this hotel. 
They're not. 
I am. 
It's a beautiful day, Mitch. 
You okay? 
You look taller. 
Life is good, my friend. 
Life is good. 
Yeah? 
So why'd they page me? 
Well, we had some sort of camera glitch in the south elevator bank. 
All the cameras in the elevator cars went out for a little over three minutes. 
Three minutes? Mmm-hmm. 
But they're back on? 
Yeah. We're fine now. 
Electrical says it was some sort of overload. 
Okay. Well, keep an eye on it. 
Let me know if it happens again. 
It's a beautiful day, folks! 
I'm so glad you decided to stay. 
You have no idea. 
Did you mean it when you said you'd like to make me the happiest woman in the world? 
You know I did. 
I'd do anything for you, Sam. 
What if what I wanted was big? 
Really, really big? 
There is nothing outside of my reach that you cannot have. 
What is it that you want? 
Do you know I was left this hotel? 
Unfortunate about your ex-husband, yeah. 
Yes. I was also left with a mountain of debt. 
And if I can't pay the money, the government's going to take this hotel from me. 
And so you would like me to pay off this $ 241-million debt? 
How did you know that number? 
Sam, my world is finance. 
No number that large escapes my radar. 
So what do you think? 
I think I just bought you a hotel. 
Really? 
You're kidding. 
Like I said, anything you want. 
A toast. 
To a beautiful partnership. 
To a beautiful partnership. 
That really goes right to your head. 
What did you put in there? 
Just hit this button right here. 
You'll have total surveillance access to the whole place. 
Oh, that's great. 
Thanks a lot, huh, Jack? 
All right, Mr. Deline. 
What the hell happened to you? 
Wallace. 
It's done. 
I took care of it just like I said I would. 
It's over. 
You all right? 
I'm fine. 
Look, um... 
I'm sorry I blew up at you like that. You know? 
You know what? It's all right. 
I do need you to understand something. 
Delinda and I are going to need some space to live our lives. 
To make mistakes, to have fights. 
You know, basically just be a couple. 
What's your problem? 
Well, you and Jillian can be suffocating. 
She's my daughter. 
You know. I just... 
Yeah, I know. 
And I know it's been a tough year, but this relationship's never going to work under this kind of scrutiny. 
Okay. 
Tell you what. 
We'll, uh... We'll back off. 
Thank you, Ed. 
Okay. 
So, we're... 
Yeah. 
Yeah, we're fine. 
All right. 
Good. 
Go home, please. 
Clean yourself up just a little. 
Hey, D. 
Hi, baby. 
You feeling better? 
Yeah. Pretty good. 
Had a little chat with your dad. 
Lucky you. 
How'd it go? 
Well, he said he's going to back off. 
Heard that before. 
No. I think that he really means it. 
Great. 
Son of a bitch. 
Well, I got a job offer from another casino, Ed. 
Good. So, turn it down. 
I'm thinking maybe I should take this one. 
Come on. 
You got to be kidding me. 
You're with me twenty years. 
You're going to quit me now? 
This is no joke, Ed. 
No, it's not a joke. 
I know what it is though. It's... 
You're looking to shake me down. 
Is that right, Tommy Boy? 
Well, okay. I'll tell you what. 
I'll give you a little bump. 
How's that? 
Ed, how you going to do that? 
The word is Casey got whacked because he was leveraged to the gills. 
Now, the Montecito is being foreclosed on. 
Everybody's going to lose their job. 
Ed, I got kids in college. 
Do what you got to do, okay? 
But listen to me. 
I'm going to wind up buying this joint outright. Okay? 
So that's how it's going to be? 
We'll talk later. 
You made your choice. 
It's not like that, Jillian. 
Yeah, it is like that, Ed. 
So, I'm making my choice. 
Jillian. 
Jillian! 
I told you to stay out of our lives. 
NARRATOR : Previously on Las Vegas. 
How would you like to be my co-partner in the Montecito? 
Why wouldn't I just wait a week until the irs seizes this place, and then I can buy it in private auction? 
Don't move, bitch. 
I can't shake him. My father. 
I told you that if you ever came near her again I would kill you. 
There's only one way I'll ever feel safe from him. 
You okay? 
I called you. 
Where were you? 
Mary needed to talk. I... 
You were with Mary? 
She needed me to... 
I needed you. 
I don't want her going back to that condo. 
Look, I got security wiring that joint tomorrow like it was Fort Knox. 
I'd do anything for you, Sam. 
What if what I wanted was big? 
I think I just bought you a hotel. 
Had a little chat with your dad. 
You'll have total surveillance access to the whole place. 
How'd it go? 
He said he's going to back off. 
What did you put in there? 
Son of a bitch! 
I told you to stay out of our lives. 
Have you seen Sam? 
Not since last night. 
You try her cell? 
She's not answering. 
Something I can help you with? 
Ed needs to talk to her. 
She was working at least half a dozen different whales last night. 
They had her running all over the place. 
She could be anywhere. 
Apparently trying to round up financial backing to bail out the Montecito. 
So the rumors are true? 
Ed's got it under control. 
Money plays, baby! 
Money plays. 
Excuse me, Mike. 
Mary. Hmm? 
Have you seen Sam? 
No. 
But I haven't really been looking for her, either. 
Erika. 
Guess you're off the clock. 
No, just a little late lunch. 
Cheers. 
You guys seen Danny? 
He didn't come home last night. 
Not since he punched out your father. 
Danny punched Daddy? 
Right in the middle of the lobby. 
Oh, my God. 
You haven't seen Sam, have you? 
Sam? 
No. 
If either of you run into her, tell her Ed needs to see her ASAP. 
He's looking for her. 
You don't look so good. 
Stomach flu. 
You drinking on the job? 
No, I am drinking on my lunch break. 
Excuse me. 
Mare? 
What's going on? 
Can't a girl get a drink? 
Delinda. 
Danny just came in. 
Look, I'm sorry that I hit your dad, okay? 
But he deserved it... 
Danny... 
Lieutenant McCoy. 
Jason? 
This is the guy that I told you about that saved my life. 
What's going on? Hi. 
Danny. 
I ain't going back to the war, Lieutenant. 
Three tours is enough. 
I'm going UA, and I need you to help me. 
Whoa. Wait a second. 
Danny. 
What? What? 
Mary has a gun. 
Good morning, Sam. 
Good morning. 
Or should I say afternoon? 
Wow! Did I sleep late! How about you? 
How'd you sleep, Sammy? Huh? 
I'm feeling lucky today, Sam. 
How about you? You feeling lucky? 
In fact, I'm feeling so lucky I want to delay my departure a little, head down and do a little gambling. 
( VlNCE laughing ) 
Hey. Hold the elevator. Oh, man. 
WOMAN : Oh, my God! 
What's that smell? Ugh! 
MAN : It's awful, isn't it? WOMAN : 
Oh, we gotta get another room. 
Sam, you in there? Sam? 
Sam, I'm coming in. 
Hey, Reggie. How are you? 
Oh, that smell! 
Did you do all this, Reg? 
Has nobody been walking you? Where's your mom? 
Huh? 
Come on, come on, come on. 
Yeah. 
I bet you're thirsty, right? 
Get you some water. 
Yeah, you're thirsty. 
What's going on? 
Housekeeping? 
Mike Cannon. 
I need to send a crew to Miss Marquez's suite. 
It's pretty nasty. 
And send a bellboy up here to take her dog for a walk. 
Thank you. 
Come on. 
What about Mary? 
I'll talk to her. 
She has a gun, Danny. 
I'm worried she's gonna hurt herself, okay? 
Just find her, stick with her until I can get there. Okay? 
Danny, don't you think that this isn't your problem? 
Look, he saved my life. 
I owe him. Okay? 
Are you feeling okay? 
Yeah. Yeah. 
We just need to talk. 
Okay, well... 
I'm not apologizing to your father. 
Erika, could I get two waters over here? 
I'm supposed to ship out in 24 hours but there's no way I'm going back. 
No way. 
Okay, just calm down, J. We'll figure this out. 
But you can't go UA. 
No, you don't understand. 
I can't go back. 
I'll kill myself first. 
Hey, don't even talk like that. 
How did you manage to deploy for only one tour? 
What did you do to get out of going back? 
Well, there were special circumstances for my situation. 
But I would go back if ordered. 
Then take my place. 
No. 
The back taxes are $ 241 million. That's what... 
To tell you the truth, I'm not sure I want an ownership position here. 
I mean, the first owner, he disappeared. 
The second one's in a federal penitentiary. 
The third one flew off the roof, and Casey got attacked by a giant squid, and apparently poisoned. 
Sorry to interrupt. I think something's wrong. 
I can't find Sam anywhere. 
I need to find her. 
Look, some buyers got wind of this tax problem. 
And my only chance is to partner up with Sam and pay off the taxes before the deadline. 
I mean, we got no chance in a bidding war. Ed... 
Wait, wait... 
Yeah, that's right. No. 
Miss Marquez and I would be co-owners. 
Ed, Sam hasn't been in her room for at least a day, maybe more. 
She left her dog unattended and locked up. 
Sid, could I put you on hold for a second, please? 
Thanks. 
She loves that dog. I mean, that's not like her. 
I agree. 
Now, a person, on the other hand, she'd have no problem locking up for a few days with no food or water. 
You need to find her for me, Mike. 
Okay. 
Sorry, there, Sid. 
I've had it, Ed. 
I'm on the phone. 
It's me or the Montecito. 
What the hell is that? 
Divorce papers. 
What? 
If you sign ownership papers on the Montecito, you can sign those, too. 
What is this," Crap on Ed Day?" Mom? 
What did you do to her now? 
I did nothing. 
Of course you didn't. 
Just like you didn't put surveillance cameras in Danny's and my place! 
Delinda, I'm on the phone. 
There's a problem with Mary. 
What problem? 
She has a gun. 
You sure? 
I know what a gun looks like. 
Sid, I'm gonna have to call you back in a minute. 
Yeah, thanks. 
What is the problem? 
I don't want to betray Danny and Mary, but... Wait, wait. 
What has Danny got to do with this? 
Something happened when Mary was little. Her father... 
I think Mary may be planning something. 
Her father just got released from jail and I know she wants to protect her younger sisters. 
I think I'm gonna be sick. 
Let's Video lQ Sam. 
We need to find her ASAP. 
Ed just called and told us to Video lQ Mary. What's going on? 
Mary? 
He also wants us to call him if she leaves the Montecito property. 
Okay, I've got Mary in an employee hallway. 
Looks like she's headed into the ladies' room. 
What about Sam? 
There's no sign of her. 
Let's backtrack and find her last location. 
Maybe she left the Montecito. 
I know I don't need to remind you there are no cameras in the ladies' room. Yes, Shannon. 
I know. 
You okay? 
I'm pregnant. 
Gently, gently. 
Nine! 
Who loves you, huh? Come on. 
Here we go. 
Get these beauties down here. 
Four! ( ALL cheering ) 
The two women are known prostitutes. 
I'm more worried about the streak he's on. vince : 
All right. 
Give me those two little darlings. 
Mr. Peterson, is your casino host with you? Sam? 
No, she's tied up at the moment. 
You sure? I peed on 10 sticks. 
Every one came back positive. 
( SNlFFLES ) 
Does Danny know? 
Hard eight! ( ALL cheering ) 
Oh, yes! 
Mike. 
Yeah, I see them. 
No, no. 
Not the hookers. 
See the roll this guy's on? 
Have you found Sam yet? 
Do we have Sam's last location pinpointed yet? 
She was all over the place. 
Valet, tables, hallways... 
Wolfgang Puck's, lobby, upstairs, downstairs... 
But she definitely didn't leave the Montecito. She's here somewhere. 
We haven't been able to track her down yet. 
I'll send security to escort the ladies out. 
Maybe they'll slow the table down. Okay? 
I haven't slept in weeks. 
Now these nightmares, they're taking over when I'm awake. 
I can't get these images out of my head. 
My buddies being blown to pieces. 
Those innocent women and children. 
And body parts everywhere. 
Have you spoken to your commanding officer? Of course. 
But if they let every Marine who couldn't sleep and had nightmares out on medical discharge, there'd be nobody left to fight the war, Lieutenant. 
Well, clearly you're in no condition to go back to Iraq. 
That's why I'm going UA. 
Unauthorized absence is not the way to go. 
Let me make a few phone calls and see what I can do. 
Thank you, Lieutenant. It's not" Lieutenant". 
It's Danny. 
Thank you, Danny. 
I'm gonna check you into a room. 
Let you chill while I figure this out. Come on. Yeah. 
Mary. Yeah? 
You wanna talk about it? About what? 
About your father. 
No. Mary, don't you think I know about what happened? 
This is not your concern. 
Just leave her alone. 
Listen, I let you get away with one, but if you and I are gonna coexist, you gotta start showing me a little respect. 
Where the hell is she? 
Thank you, gentlemen, for your kindness and generosity. 
Sorry, folks, but I've got a plane to catch. ( ALL protesting ) 
I'll credit your account and let Sam know. Oh, that's all right. 
I'll let Sam know myself. 
Ladies. 
Bye. Bye, Vince. 
Thanks, Vince. 
Thank you. 
What's going on Mary? Nothing. 
Delinda told me you have a gun. 
I don't know what she's talking about. Mary. 
Where is it? 
I put it away. 
It's for protection in case my father comes after me for testifying against him. ( sighs ) Mary... 
You didn't see the way he looked at me, Danny. 
I'm scared. 
That's what the police are for. 
The police let him go. 
And he just sat there with that smirk on his face, mocking me. 
Oh, hey, my stepmother took him back. Yeah. 
That means he's with my little sisters. 
Son of a bitch. Does he still go to that bar after work every night? 
Yeah, same one he went to since we were kids. 
Only now he goes after his church meetings. 
You think I should have a little chit-chat with him? Please, just leave it alone. 
Hopefully I'll never see him again. 
Just promise me you're not gonna do anything stupid, please. 
I promise. 
Okay. 
Get back to work. 
That hurt? No. 
It's fine. 
We've pinpointed Sam's last position. 
What kind of problem? 
Remember that three-minute glitch in the south elevator bank? 
Sam was on one of the elevators. Yep. She could be on any one of 60 floors. 
Let's start checking. 
One floor at a time. 
The only problem with that is, the glitch affected the cameras outside the elevator bank as well. 
So if Sam entered a room within 100 feet of the elevators during those three minutes, we'll never find her. 
Somebody help me! Help! 
You wanna party? 
Oh, thanks, but no thanks. 
I've got a party up in my room I'm waiting to get to. 
In fact, I'm feeling downright frisky. ( CHORTLlNG ) 
Help! ( gasping ) 
We need to talk. 
Are you okay? 
Danny, where do you see our relationship going? Uh... 
Did you make those calls yet? 
Yeah, I did, but I haven't heard anything back yet. 
If you don't come through for me, Danny, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I will call you as soon as I hear something. 
Just go to your room and relax. 
No! Have a sip of whiskey or something. No. 
I can't. I can't. 
I can't. 
I feel like the fricking walls are closing in on me. 
I think I'm losing it. 
Well, if the walls are closing in, I guess we should get you a bigger suite. Give me a minute. 
I'm pregnant. 
No sign of her on floors one through 15. 15 through 30 are clear as well. 
Well, check 30 through 60. 
Thirty through 60 are clear. There's no sign of her anywhere. 
She disappeared during the three minutes the cameras were out. 
Mike, what if the glitch was planned? You think someone grabbed her? 
Yeah, it sure seems like it. 
Mitch, run a diagnostics on the entire system. 
We did that when it went down and got nothing. Run it again. 
Let's start checking every camera on every floor in the south wing. 
Maybe we'll get lucky and pick up a piece of her. 
That's over 1,000 cameras. 
I know. 
So let's get moving. 
Answer. 
I'm home! 
( RINGING ) 
Answer the phone. 
Come on. 
Answer the phone. 
Please. 
Good evening, Mr. Peterson. How can I help you? 
What are you doing, Sam? 
If you needed to stretch your legs, you should have said so. Now look what you've done. 
You've given yourself a boo-boo. 
You'll never get away with this. Get away with what? 
What do you think I have planned, Sam? 
Whatever it is, you'll never get away with it. 
I've gotten away with it so many times before. 
Why should this be any different? 
You're sick. 
No, I'm rich. 
And when you're rich, you can get away with anything. 
That's what makes America such a great country. 
I have to go to the bathroom. Go ahead and go. 
Damp girls kind of get me excited. 
Whatever it is that you're going to do, just do it. 
Like, just do it and get it over with? 
This is foreplay, Sam. I'm taking you with me. 
( knocking AT DOOR ) No. 
Housekeeping. 
Come back later. 
When I'm through with you, you're gonna wish you were dead. 
This is Mr. Peterson. 
I need a couple of bellboys to help with my luggage. 
And if they're in my suite in two minutes, I'll give them $ 1,000 each. Thank you. 
It's time for us to check out, Sammy baby. 
Yeah, he's already done three tours. 
I'm telling you, the guy is in no condition to go back to a war zone. 
No, I'm not a doctor... 
Fine, I'll get a doctor to look at him. 
Only an authorized military physician? 
Who's your CO? 
General McAllister. Okay. All right. 
Thanks. 
I'll call him. 
What did you want to tell me? 
I'm pregnant. 
Are you kidding me? 
I'm going to be a grandmother? Mom, please. 
Please don't do that. 
Sorry. 
I take it this was a big surprise? 
Yeah. 
And? 
And I don't know what to do. 
Well, what does Danny want to do? 
Well, he doesn't... He doesn't know yet. 
Honey, you have to tell him. 
It's just... 
What... 
What? 
What if he doesn't want to do what I want to do? 
How are you gonna know if you don't tell him? I love him, Mom. 
I really do. 
But after everything that's happened, and he and Daddy getting into it and... 
Delinda, don't let your father influence your life. 
Take him out of the equation. I have. 
What's that supposed to mean? 
I gave your dad an ultimatum. 
I said," It's me or the Montecito." 
What did he say? 
He hasn't yet, but... 
Honey, just go talk to Danny. 
I think he may still have feelings for Mary, Mom. 
And if he does, I don't want this to influence him one way or the other. 
Something's moving around in your trunk. Oh, yeah. 
That's just my sex toys. 
( ALL LAUGH ) 
Hey, it's Vegas, right? Here's that $ 1,000 I promised you. 
Thank you. 
Here you go, my friend. 
Nice. 
Yeah, General McAllister? 
Thank you so much for calling me back, sir. 
Thank you, sir. 
No, sir, I'm actually calling about a fellow Marine. Jason Scott. 
Yeah, I know, sir. But... 
I just don't think that he's fit for duty. 
Yes, sir. 
Thank you, sir. 
Look, Jillian, we need to talk. Okay. 
Why don't you come to Wolfgang's? 
We'll have an early dinner. 
( STAMMERING ) I'm not really that hungry. 
Why don't you just come up to my office? No, you know what? 
I'm tired of coming to you. 
You wanna talk, you come to me. 
That felt good. Don't tell Daddy I'm pregnant. 
Where are you going? 
I'm gonna talk to Danny. 
I'm sorry, J, but you gotta go. You gotta ship out in the morning. 
But they promised me that once get there they'll give you a full medical eval. 
And if the doctors agree, they'll send you home. 
That's what they said before my last tour. 
Listen. 
If I could take your place, I would. 
Thank you for the suite and the hospitality, Lieutenant. 
Yeah. 
Maybe we can catch a beer later? 
Sure. 
mitch : That three-minute glitch wasn't a glitch. 
Somebody shut down the cameras manually, then turned them back on. 
I think Shannon was right. 
Somebody grabbed Sam. 
We gotta find her. 
General McAllister, please. 
I got her. 
You sure that's her? 
Pretty sure. 
It looks like she entered a room. 
What room? 
Checking now. 
mike : Whose room? 
Vince Peterson. 
Get security up there. 
Mitch, video lQ Peterson. 
Working on it. 
Yes, sir. 
General, I'm sure... ( MUFFLED screaming ) 
Mary! 
Yes, sir. 
I understand that. 
( screaming ) I understand. 
Yes. I understand. 
Vince Peterson just checked out. 
Find him, Mitch. 
Working on it. 
Mary! 
Hey, go grab my car. It's... 
Careful with that. 
Sorry, Mr. Peterson. 
All right. 
All right. 
There's no sign of Sam. 
Peterson's suite is empty. 
First of all, with everything going on, I don't need you hanging up on me. 
And yes, I do think my marriage is more important than the Montecito. 
Okay? 
Okay. 
So retire. 
I don't want to retire. 
What the hell am I gonna do? 
Play with your grandchild. 
What did you just say? 
Jillian. 
Delinda's pregnant. 
Now, when she tells you, you have to pretend like you don't know. Okay? 
Is it a boy or a girl? 
Oh, honey, it's too early to tell. Right. 
Right. 
It's wonderful, isn't it? 
I'm gonna be a grandpa. Wow! 
But don't say anything, because she hasn't told Danny yet. 
She wants to surprise him, right? Yeah. 
Something like that. 
Get me Ed. 
Yeah? 
Ed, you wanted us to let you know if Mary left the Montecito. 
She did, and Danny followed. All right. 
Thanks, Mitch. 
Hey, I need you to check on Jason. 
Tell him everything's worked out. 
He's not gonna have to deploy. 
Danny, I'm pregnant. 
I want to keep... ( STATIC BUZZING ) 
I want us to keep the baby. 
Babe, I can't... 
Baby, you're breaking up. 
I can't hear you. Danny. 
I'm gonna call you back in a little bit. 
Danny. 
Let me see a thermal imaging on that trunk. 
She's in the trunk. She... 
That's not a Montecito Escalade. 
Find out whose Escalade that is and where it's headed and call me with the info. 
And get ahold of Ed and Danny and tell them what's happening. 
( PHONE ringing ) Jeez! 
Yeah? 
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Deline, but I have a General McAllister on the line for you. 
He says it's urgent. 
General McAllister? Yeah. 
Put him through, please. 
What's this? 
Yeah, Mac. 
What's going on? 
What? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
I know it's his choice... 
Listen, just do me a favor. 
Don't do anything until I get a chance to talk to him. Okay? 
Appreciate it. 
All right. 
Thanks, pal. 
The stupid kid. Who? 
I mean, he has no idea how many strings I pulled for this not to happen. Danny. 
What? 
What's going on? 
He... 
He volunteered to deploy in place of some other Marine. 
Oh, my God. 
Supposed to ship out tomorrow. 
I gotta go. 
( ALARM blaring ) ( ALARMS ringing ) 
Surveillance cams in the south elevator bank just went out. 
Get me backup. 
Backup's out, too. 
We're being hit! Get me security down there right now! 
... the entire building. Let's go! 
MAN : We're taking heavy fire! 
We have officers down! 
Oh, my God. 
Officers down! 
Danny sent me to check on you. I got good news. 
Danny took care of it. 
Jason, what are you doing? 
They can't make me go. 
You don't have to go back. 
IED's are a lot easier to make than you think. 
Why do you think we're getting our asses blown up every day? 
Oh, I know. 
Oh, no! 
Sam. 
Okay. 
Look, I'm just gonna call Danny, okay? 
It's just Danny. 
( CELL PHONE ringing ) 
Yeah? Danny. Hey. 
He doesn't believe me. 
Danny, he has a bomb. 
What? 
( CELL PHONE ringing ) 
Yeah? 
Ed, the Montecito's being hit! What? 
( CAR LOCKS BEEPlNG ) 
Previously on" lost"... 
You want me to save your life? 
I want you to want to save my life. 
I just made a small incision in ben's kidney sac. 
Now if I don't stitch that back up in the next hour, he's dead. 
I would like for you to go back in there, put Ben under and finish the surgery. 
And why would I want to do that? 
Because I'm going to go help your friends escape. 
- No! 
- Danny! 
Stop. 
What, you wanna turn steering? 
We have to go back. 
What the hell are you talkin' about? 
Turn the boat around, Sawyer. 
I mean it. 
Have you lost your mind? 
We just got away. 
Just do it. 
- Give me one good reason to turn around- - 
- Because we can't leave Jack behind. 
Yes, we can, Freckles...'cause that's what he asked us to do. 
I mean, think about it- - we go back there, what do you think cap'n bunnykiller's gonna do if he catches us? 
He'll kill you. 
God loves you as he loved Jacob. 
Okay. 
Thanks for the input. 
Sorry, kiddo... 
Jack's on his own. 
Time to get up. 
We're moving you. 
- Moving me where? 
- Someplace else, Jack. 
Why? 
- So this is it, huh? 
-" It"? 
You just helped me save his life. 
If you're gonna kill me, please, at least show me the respect of not calling it" moving." 
Now why would we kill you? 
Because you're done with me. 
What kind of people do you think we are, Jack? 
Oh, I don't know, Tom- - the kind of people that would take a pregnant woman... would hang Charlie from a tree... would drag our people out of the jungle... would kidnap children- - that's the kind of people I think you are. 
You see this glass house you're living in, Jack? 
How' bout I get you some stones? 
Let's do this the easy way. What do you say? 
Hey. 
Dr. Jack? 
Hey, Dr. Jack? 
Dr. Jack want soda, Dr. Jack? 
You know I can't understand a word you're saying, right? 
Dr. Jack. 
You're welcome. 
Thank you. 
Thank you very much. 
You're not from around here, are you? 
No. No, I'm not. 
I'm... I'm Jack. 
Hi, Jack. 
I'm Achara. 
Achara... 
Achara. 
Juliet grilled these for me. 
Who's that woman? 
That'd be the sheriff. 
- You have a sheriff? 
- Not literally, Jack. 
Why are you moving Juliet into my room? 
'Cause she's in trouble, Jack. 
Now don't try anything stupid. 
You stay put in this cage, okay? 
You say that like you're not watching me from that camera right there. 
Oh, right. Ben told me you got into the surveillance room. 
Let me ask you something. 
You risk your neck to cut them loose, and they run away and don't ever look back- - 
Thanks for the sandwich. 
Never thought I'd be glad to get back to this rock again. 
What are you doing? 
What's it look like? 
I'm heading into shore. 
Why? If we just keep going, we can circle round. 
Sooner or later we'll get to camp. 
We can tell Locke and Sayid what happened. 
Oh, we will, huh? You got a map you ain't showing' me, Magellan? 
We got no food, no water, and I can't steer in the dark. 
- Then I'll steer. 
- No. You'll come ashore, and we'll make camp. 
You want to contribute? 
You can build a campfire while I carry the kid. 
Glad we agree. 
- Sure you ain't hungry? 
- No, James, I ain't hungry. 
You shouldn't fight. 
When the hell did you wake up? 
You shouldn't fight because you're lucky to be alive. 
Golly! 
I think he's got a point. 
That island we were on- - is that where your people live? 
- Just where we work. 
- Work on what? 
Projects. 
Oh, sure, like the" steal the kid off the raft" project? 
That was a humdinger. 
So you don't actually live on that island? 
Nope. 
Do you live here... on this island? 
Yes, ma'am. 
And what did you do with the people that you took... the kids? 
We give them a better life. 
Better than what? 
Better than yours. 
There's not gonna be any moon tonight. 
It'll be dark. 
Me and Alex used to lie in my backyard at night, make up names for the constellations. 
You can't see it yet, but right there will be" ursa theodorus"... the teddy bear. 
- You have backyards? 
- Yeah. 
Well, ain't that quaint? 
Warning. 
Warning. 
I thought you were locked up. 
They let me out to examine Ben. 
His vitals are low, and he has a fever. 
I took this about ten minutes ago. 
It's of his stitches. 
They're infected, aren't they? 
Yes. 
Will you come look at' em? 
No. 
- Jack- - 
- No. I'm not asking you for them... 
or him. 
I'm asking you as a personal favor to me. 
You... want me to help him again? 
Yes. 
Are you sure about that, Juliet? 
Yes... I'm sure. 
And this is because he said that he would let you go home? 
No. 
No, I... 
It's because I'm in trouble. 
- Trouble? 
For- - - I just killed someone. 
That's why they put me in your room. 
Who? 
It's complicated. 
Well, then, let me simplify it for you. 
I'm not gonna help him... and I'm not gonna help you. 
Okay. 
Special thai dish for you. 
You try. 
Very brave, very brave. 
My brother likes you. 
Well, I'm a pretty likable guy. 
So, Jack... tell me something. 
Shoot. 
Why is you don't know how to fly a kite? 
- Just never learned, I guess. 
- That's very sad. 
Well, my dad worked a lot, and he wasn't exactly the kite-flying type, anyway. 
- I mean, we never really- - 
- Jack. 
- Yeah? 
- I have no interest in your father. 
Well, that's a relief, because I'm pretty tiredof talking about him. 
Some things are personal. 
So you're in Phuket to, um," find yourself"? 
- Why would you say that? 
- You're an american. 
I have... a gift. 
Must be one hell of a gift. 
Oh, I was just reading your tattoos. 
The" five" and the stars are very cute, but the chinese I find... a bit ironic. 
- You find what ironic? 
- What it says. 
You do know what it says? 
Yeah, I know what it says. 
Are you sure? 
Chinese is a very complicated language. 
It's fairly common for some things to get lost in translation. 
- I know what it says. 
- All right, then. 
Jack... my name is Isabel. 
If you'll come with me, 
I'd like to talk to you and ask you a few questions. 
Why don't you check on your father, sweetheart? 
I know he'd appreciate it. 
Please, have a seat, Jack. 
As you may have gathered, we don't live on this little island. 
In fact, most of us don't really even like coming here. 
There's been an incident that I'm investigating, and I need to ask you some questions, so I was hoping you may help me clear up a few of the... inconsistencies. 
Now correct me if I'm wrong, Tom, but you said, in the midst of a surgical procedure, 
Jack made several comments indicating that Juliet had asked him to kill Ben. 
Yeah. 
That's right. 
Is that true, Jack? 
Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben? 
The question's simple. 
Did Juliet ask you to kill Ben? 
No. 
No, I was lying. 
I would've done anything to get my friends out, and turning you people against each other was my best chance of creating chaos. 
Why are you lying for her, Jack? 
I'd like to go back to my cage now. 
Who's there? 
Mmm. Who do you think? 
What time is it? 
Oh, it's late. 
Salty. 
I went for a swim in the ocean. 
Washing the day off of you, huh? 
Is there something you'd like to ask me, Jack? 
No, not at all. 
I mean... it might be nice... after a month of you coming and going whenever you want, to find out something about you. 
There are things that happen here that you could never understand. 
Like your gift? 
Yes... like my gift. 
Are you having fun with me, Jack? 
Oh, yeah. 
Then stop ask questions. 
Let's have fun. 
What? ! 
Hey... Jack. 
Do I know you? 
815. 
You're... 
- You were the stewardess. 
- Cindy. 
What are you doing here, with them? 
I thought you were taken. 
- You were captured. 
- They're not, um... 
It's not that simple. 
What are they doing here right now? 
What are you doing here? ! 
We're here to watch, Jack. 
Watch what? 
What is it, sweetheart? 
She wants to know how Ana Lucia's doing. 
Are you serious? What? 
If you've got something to watch, Cindy, go watch it! 
Go! 
- Sawyer. - What? 
Sawyer, wake up. 
He's gone. Karl's gone. 
Where? 
I got it. 
No, let me talk to him. 
No, I got it. 
Boys only. 
What the hell was that for? 
So you'd cowboy up. 
Crying in the jungle. 
Thought you people were supposed to be tough. I am tough. 
Sure you are, Bobby. 
Bobby?" The brady bunch"? 
What the hell's" the brady bunch"? 
Okay... anyway, look, Karl... 
I been with a lot of girls... some of' em worth the trouble... some not. 
Every now and again... there's one... one you name dumb stars with. 
So this girl, Sally Slingshot- - 
- Alex. - Yeah. 
You love her? 
More than anything. 
Then go back to wherever the hell your... yards are, and get her back. 
If I get caught, they'll kill me this time. 
Well... at least it'll be worth it. 
I wanna ask you something. 
They're not watching anymore, so you can tell me the truth. Okay. 
Ben- - why'd you save his life? 
All this time- - after all he did to you and your people- - you should hate him, but you still fixed him up, even after your friends got away. 
Why? 
You're his daughter. 
Answer the question. 
I'll answer your question if you answer one of mine. 
Where's Juliet? 
She's with the rest of them. 
They're gonna read her verdict. Her verdict? 
And we all know what it's gonna be. 
We're pretty strict about killing one of our own. 
Eye for an eye. Who? 
Who did she kill? 
The man who was gonna murder your friends. 
No wonder you're so worried about her. 
If it wasn't for you, she never would have done it. 
That was three questions. 
Your turn, Jack. 
I saved your father because I said I would. 
Hey. Hey. 
Is he still in charge? 
What? 
Ben, your father- - is he still in charge? 
Will that woman Isabel do what he says? 
Yeah. 
Get me out of this cage. 
I wouldn't do that. 
The cavalry has arrived at last. 
I'd be much more impressed with you people if you had a good surgeon. 
We had an excellent surgeon, Jack. 
His name was Ethan. 
You have a very serious infection, Ben. 
That infected tissue needs to be re-incised, debrided, and you need to be very closely monitored from here on out. 
There might be nerve damage or any number of other complications. 
You might not walk again. 
Your bedside manner leaves something to be desired, Jack. 
Well, then, it's too bad you're stuck with me. 
Am I? 
You need a doctor, Ben, someone to stay with you, bring you back to good health. 
And here we go again. 
I've already given you a ticket off this island, Jack. 
What's it gonna cost me this time? 
Right now, your people are in a room deciding whether or not to execute Juliet. 
You're gonna stop it. 
Juliet doesn't care about you, Jack. 
Doesn't matter what she's done, no matter what you think... she's one of us. 
Do we have a deal or not? 
Does Isabel have a walkie? 
They're already in the meeting. 
Then get me something to write on. 
You following me. 
What is all this? 
This is where I work, and you shouldn't be here. 
This is a... a tattoo parlor. 
This was your big secret- - the envelopes... your gift? 
I am not a tattoo artist. 
I'm able to see who people are. 
My work is not decoration... it is definition... and this... this is my gift. 
So... you see who people are. 
Yes... and I mark them. 
So tell me who I am. 
- No. 
- Why not? 
You are an outsider. 
So you can sleep with me- - 
Do you see who I am, Achara? 
Yes. 
Who am I? 
You are a leader, a great man. 
But this... this makes you lonely... and frightened... and angry. 
Good. 
Now put it on me. 
Put it on me. 
No. 
This... this is against my people. 
There will be consequences, Jack. 
There always are. 
Wait. 
No, you shouldn't be here. 
Just stand back. Don't say anything. 
Alex, you- - 
Jack? 
What the hell did you bring him here for? 
! Let him go, Tom. 
What's going on, Alex? 
This is from Ben. 
Ben has commuted Juliet's sentence. 
Execution is off the table. 
He says the rules don't apply. 
He has, however, ordered her to be marked. 
Hey, where you going? 
Hey, I know you. 
I'm Achara's friend from... 
Jack from the restaurant. 
Let go of me, man. 
You will get off our beach! 
You leave this country! Do you understand me? 
I heard you only liked them grilled. 
I missed the toothpicks, too. 
- Let me see. 
- Jack... 
They marked you. 
Break a branch off that aloe plant over there- - 
- It's okay, Jack. 
- Please. Please do it. 
All right, turn around. 
Why did you help me? 
He told you he was gonna let you go home. 
He told me the same thing. 
We're gonna make sure he keeps his word. 
And how are we going to do that? 
Together. 
They'll be coming for you in a few minutes- - all of them. 
Your friends know where we are, so we have to leave this island to go back to where we live. 
Go where? 
Well, Ben calls it" home." 
- Where's Karl? 
- I let him go. 
- You what? 
- I let him go. 
He could have led us back to where they live. 
What, you think I cut him loose'cause I'm so damn sensitive? 
The kid's a target. 
Ben ain't never gonna stop lookin' for him, so as long- - all ben wants is that kid as far from his daughter as possible. 
Let's get back to camp. 
Are you coming or not? 
Should I walk beside you or ten paces behind you? 
You've gotten so good at telling me what to do, I can't think for myself anymore. 
Don't take it out on me'cause you feel guilty. 
- I don't feel guilty. 
- The hell you don't! We had to leave Jack behind. 
I didn't have a choice- - 
I'm not talkin' about leavin' Jack behind. 
I'm talkin' about you and me. 
I know you did it' cause you thought I was a dead man... 
So don't beat yourself up'cause the doc's left behind. 
I'm not beating myself up. 
'Course you're not. 
So now that we got that out of the way, let's go. 
" He walks amongst us, but he is not one of us." 
Your tattoos- - that's what they say. 
That's what they say. 
It's not what they mean. 
May I ask you something? 
Anything, pal. how do you know Claire was drowning? 
Claire! 
I could hear her calling for help. 
You, uh... hear the lightning as well? 
I wasn't saving Claire, Charlie. 
I was saving you. 
when I saw the lightning hit the roof, you were electrocuted, and when you heard Claire was in the water, you... you drowned trying to save her. 
I've tried, brother, I've tried twice to save you, but no matter what I try to do... you're gonna die, Charlie. 
You're insane, mate. 
Superman can fly around the entire planet in the blink of an eye. 
Dude, if we're going by a pure foot race, 
Supes would get dusted by the Flash. But why would the Man of Steel agree to a sodding foot race? 
Uh, for charity? 
And Flash would totally win,'cause he can, like, vibrate through walls and stuff. 
Ooh, vibration. 
Whatever would Superman do if he came up against a wall? Well, no smashing allowed... 
No flying, no smashing. 
any other restrictions I need to know about? Perhaps we should fit Superman with a pair of Kryptonite... 
The hell? 
Charlie! 
No, don't! 
Don't touch it. 
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God! 
Just breathe. Just breathe, huh? 
Looks like it's homemade. 
We've got to get back. - No! 
You help! - I can't help! 
I'm sorry, mate. 
Here it is. Here it is. 
Superman can fly around the entire planet... 
Hey. 
Where's the wire? 
Did you eat those mushrooms Jack warned us about? 
Listen to me. There's a wire, a cable buried in the sand. 
Do you know what I'm talking about? 
This is future crap, isn't it? The cable, do you know where it is? 
- This is important. 
Superman... 
Because someone's coming. 
God tests our faith in many ways. 
So, as you well know, we have our own test here. 
A vow of silence that lasts as long as we see fit. 
This challenges both one's patience... and his faith. 
For some, it may last a week. 
Those we're less sure about, a month. 
Personally, Desmond, I never thought you'd last... 
And so now I stand corrected. 
For whatever reason, your path has led you here. 
And now you're one of us. 
Welcome, brother. 
Thank you... 
Brother. 
Morning, Jack. 
Must be nice to wake up in your own bed. 
Yeah. Home, sweet home. 
So I was wondering if I could borrow your first aid kit. 
I've, uh, twisted my ankle. 
You want me to take a look at it? 
No, you're all right. 
I've taped my share of ankles. 
Right. 
Thanks. 
Something wrong, Hurley? 
No, uh-uh. 
Just... keeping Desmond here company...'cause we're friends. 
Bring that back when you're done with it, okay? 
Absolutely. 
What the hell was that? 
Do you want him to get suspicious? Suspicious of what? 
Oh, this is like when you knew Claire was drowning, isn't it? 
That's why you got the first aid kit. 
- Someone's gonna get hurt. 
Is it me? - No. 
It's just a precaution. Look, dude, you want me to take you to the wire? 
I want an explanation. 
I saw a sequence of events- - 
Things that are gonna happen. 
What'd you see? 
It was... 
It was like a sort of jigsaw puzzle, only I didn't have the picture on the box, so I don't know how the pieces fit exactly. 
But... but one of the pieces- - the first one... it was you, pulling the cable out of the sand. 
So what are the other pieces? 
If I tell you that, it'll change the picture on the box. 
So what? 
Isn't that the point- - preventing something bad? 
Not this time. 
So you're not trying to stop something from happening. 
You actually want it to happen. 
More than anything. 
Hey, Freckles, you home? 
Thought you won't allow to use nicknames. 
Well, you weren't around when I lost the bet, so you're... 
Exempt. 
What's up? 
I... wanted to ask you something. 
Yeah? I'm up here. 
Uh... So did you tell him? 
Did I tell who what? 
You know. 
Did you tell the Doc... about you and me? 
No... but he knows. 
He saw us on one of their surveillance monitors. 
- I thought you said the camera was broken. - Well, they had another camera. 
Those perverts. 
Anyway, he knows. 
Well, now that that's outta the way... 
How about a little afternoon delight? 
That means sex. 
Come on, Freckles, wait. 
Now- - do you need me to make you a mix tape? 
yeah, why don't you do that? 
Dude, you're gonna have to tell me again. 
- What do we need Jin for? - Because he was there with us. 
On the beach, when I find the cable? 
This way. 
Here it is. 
That's right. In one of your puzzle flashes? 
Aye. 
So... if he doesn't come, then neither does the someone you won't tell me anything about? 
That'd be the long and short of it, 
but I've no bloody idea how I'm gonna get him to come with us. 
Watch the master. 
Camping? 
Yeah, you know, like, sleeping under the stars, fire on the beach, marshmallows. 
Camping. 
Yes. 
Everybody likes marshmallows. 
Good man. 
Get food, water. 
Where are you going? 
We need one more. 
How daft do you think I am? 
This isn't a camping trip. 
You've had another one of your visions, haven't you? 
What was it this time? 
Someone's coming to the island. 
Coming? 
As in someone who's not already here? 
How the hell is that gonna happen? 
I can't tell you. 
It's got nothing to do with me? 
Well, you're a part of it, as are Jin and Hurley. 
Right, but with all due respect, you haven't previously told 
Jin or Hurley that they're gonna die. 
Well, that's not gonna happen, not this time. 
Can I bring my guitar? 
Absolutely. 
All right, I'm in. 
You had me worried there for a second. 
This is it. 
Well, how can you tell? 
'Cause that's exactly where I followed the wire into the jungle. 
Where is it, then? 
Way to go, dude. 
Here it is. Here it is. 
Here it is. 
The beacon fell this side of the rise. 
Just one thing- - last time I followed this wire into the jungle, I almost got kebabed by one of Rousseau's spiky death trap things. 
Cut her down. 
We're not going in the jungle- - well, not yet. 
It's getting late, so, we'll, uh, we'll camp here the night. 
Camp. 
So when do they get here- - Your mysterious someone? 
Soon. 
You do realize you are free to talk again, Brother Desmond? 
Used to being quiet, I suppose. 
" Moriah". 
I find the name the brothers have chosen for the wine made here... 
Interesting. 
And why is that, brother? 
Wwell, Moriah is the mountain Where Abraham was asked to kill Isaac. 
It's not exactly the most... festive locale, is it? 
And yet God spared Isaac. 
Well, one might argue that God need not have asked Abraham to sacrifice his son in the first place. 
Well, then it wouldn't have been much of a test, would it, brother? 
Perhaps you underestimate the value of sacrifice. 
Brother Desmond, Brother Desmond. 
I met this man waiting at the gates. 
He says he needs to have a word with you. 
Sorry, sir. 
Forgive me, brother. 
Hey. 
Hey. 
The oatmeal's awesome. 
It is, huh? 
It's strange, huh? 
What's that? 
Being back, 
Not looking for a way out of a cage, not finding a reason to go running off into the jungle again. 
I almost don't know what to do with myself. 
Well, enjoy it. 
I'm sure something will go wrong soon enough. 
Well, my big, dangerous adventure for tonight is gonna be doing the dishes in the ocean. 
Well, be careful. 
I'll try. 
Um, can I borrow that spoon? 
Yeah. 
Thanks. 
Good night. 
Yeah, good night. 
What, my doorbell busted again? 
The hell are you doing? 
Shut up and don't talk. 
Hey... you crying? 
I said shut up. 
You got it. 
Dude, I love the part about the bird. 
It was a bird, right? 
You. 
Me? Okay, um, have you heard the one - about the chupacabra? 
- Chupa? 
Yeah, it's like a bear with spines, but Mexican... 
Thanks. 
Who's that? 
Her name's Penny. 
That's not bad, Des, 
Not bad at all. 
So how did you manage to leave her behind and come here? 
Because I'm a coward. 
Sorry. 
You and me both, pal. 
you know, I tried to run away from her, and she... she tracked me down. 
" With enough money and determination, you can find anyone," she said. 
You know, I used to get through my nights thinking that she actually meant it, that she never gave up... that maybe she spent the last three years... looking for me. 
What's that? 
Is that a helicopter? 
Rescue. 
Uh, is that how a helicopter's supposed to sound? 
No. 
We gotta go out there. 
- Out there? 
- Well, yeah. - In what? 
- Well, we gotta do something. 
Look. Look! 
Oh, my God. 
Pallet? 
Nah, dude, it's not a food drop. 
You saw the beacon thing. - Someone, like, ejected. 
- Yeah, but that was a helicopter. 
- You can't eject from a helicopter. 
- Well, maybe they jumped. 
All that matters is that they're here. 
" They"? How do we even know it's a person? 
Because he said" someone" was coming. 
Where are you going? 
Out to where it fell. 
Come on. 
Let's go. No, whoa, slow down. 
We're not gonna trudge out into the jungle 
-... in the middle of the night. - Yes, we are. 
Were you even listening to Hurley when he mentioned Rousseau's death trap? 
Now, it's gonna be light in two hours. 
- We'll wait until- - 
- She can't wait. 
" She"? 
They. 
Whoever it is... could be hurt. 
We have to go- - all four of us- - now. 
Why? 
Because that's the way it's supposed to happen. 
Right. Well, I guess it's supposed to happen without me. 
Superman... 
We'll leave at first light, then... together. 
Terrific. 
Is your sister in? 
Leave. 
Now. 
Let him be, Derek. 
Hello, Ruth. 
So you're a monk now, are you? 
Well, technically I'm still what they call a novice, till the abbott says- - 
Why are you here, Desmond? 
Well, now that my initiation is done, uh... 
I felt like I owed you an explanation. 
Desmond... 
You can never begin to explain what you did. 
You left one week before the wedding. 
Everything was planned, bought, and paid for. 
You just disappeared completely. 
I had a calling. 
We dated for six years, and the closest you ever came to a religious experience was Celtic winning the cup. 
Look... 
Yes, I was scared about the wedding, so I had a few pints too many, maybe. 
I... 
I raised my eyes, and I asked, 
" Am I doing the right thing?" 
and that's the last thing I remember. 
And when I woke up, 
I was lying on my back in the street, and I don't know how I got there. 
and there was this man standing over me, Ruth... and he reached out his hand and he said to me, 
" Can I help you, brother?" 
And the first thing I noticed was the rope tied around his waist, and I looked at him and... 
I knew. I knew I was supposed to go with him. 
I was supposed to leave... everything that mattered behind. 
Sacrifice all of it... for a greater calling. 
Well, it's a good thing a bloody shepherd didn't help you up, or I suppose you'd be off with the sheep, wouldn't you? 
Next time you want to break up with someone, Des, 
Don't join a monastery. 
Just tell the girl you're too bloody scared. 
You a doctor or a carpenter? 
What, your dad never taught you to use a hammer? 
No, my dad taught me how to drink. 
Well, at least it's something. 
Hope I'm not interrupting. 
You two arguing over who's your favorite Other? 
What do you want, Sawyer? 
Oh, what I wanted, Doc, was to inform you there's been some developments since you were AWOL. 
So tell me... how's your backhand? 
Where'd you get the table? 
Don't you recognize it? 
It fell out of the purple haze when the hatch went blammo. 
If we don't play every 108 minutes, the island's gonna explode. 
Finally, something I can beat you at. 
You know, considering I haven't played since I was 12, 
I wouldn't be too proud. 
What is that, 18-point? 
Yeah. 
It's kinda strange, huh... being back? 
Somethin' funny? 
Uh, Kate said the same thing in the kitchen last night. 
- She did, huh? 
- She did. 
19-point. 
So you guys ate together, huh? 
No, Juliet and I had dinner together last night. 
Best two out of three? 
You got it. 
So what's next? 
Next? 
Yeah, you saw the wire, the flashy thing falling out of the sky. 
Now what? 
Maybe I can help you find- - 
That's it. 
There is no next. 
We find the beacon. 
Why are you lying to me, mate? 
Look, mate, I've saved your life three times now. 
If that hasn't bought me your trust, I don't know what will. 
Let's move. 
Dude... 
Seriously, I'm gonna have a coronary. 
Actually, you're not, and if you don't get a move on, 
- we're not gonna make it before nightfall- - - Hey. 
Look at this. 
it can't be Rousseau's. 
if it was Rousseau's, a massive rock would be flying at my head right now. Don't move. 
- What are you doing? Ow! - Don't move. 
Ow! 
Did that come down with the flashy red light thingy? 
Walkie-talkie. 
No, dude, that's a satellite phone. 
Crap, it's dead. 
Shocker. 
Oh, my God. 
Is that you? 
Then who's she 
That would be Penny. 
What's this? 
Your mix tape. 
Well, you gonna take it, or ain't ya? 
" The Best of Phil Collins" huh? 
Don't get picky. 
And if Bernard asks, I don't know a thing about it. 
Thanks, James. 
So why'd you jump me last night? 
What? 
Was it' cause you saw the Doc hanging out with Juliet? 
It is not like that. 
It's not? 
You ain't gotta use me, Freckles. 
All you gotta do is ask. 
You think it's her, don't you? 
Who? 
Your girl- 
- Penny. 
You think it's actually her who bailed out of the helicopter. 
Earlier I hoped it. 
Now I know it. 
Why didn't you tell us? 
Would you come if I had? 
Of course. 
Why wouldn't I? 
I didn't wanna tell you because... 
I didn't want anything to change. 
Fair enough. 
Look, if whatever you're seeing leads to your girl getting us rescued, why would we want to change anything? 
Right? 
Right. 
Right. 
Thanks for the heads-up about bringing an umbrella, dude. 
Brother Desmond? 
What are you doing? 
Well, I believe I'm getting pissed on our lovely wine. 
That bottle of our lovely wine fetches over 100 quid. 
We've only bottled 108 cases this year. 
Well, it's just as well we've taken a vow of poverty then, isn't it? 
We've also taken a vow of charity. 
Right. 
Something tells me, Desmond, that you're not cut out to be a monk. 
Well, you know, I've had- - I've had a tough week. 
I'm sorry for the wine. 
I'll take the penance. 
I'm afraid you're beyond penance, Desmond. 
Brother Desmond. 
Not anymore. 
Are- - are you firing me? 
I am indeed. 
You can't do that. 
I heard the call. 
I'm sure you did hear the call, but the abbey clearly isn't where you are meant to end up. 
I have little doubt that God has different plans than you being a monk, Desmond- - bigger plans. 
Oh, aye, sure He does. 
He does. 
You've just spent too much time running away to realize what you may be running toward. 
Hey. 
What am I supposed to do now? 
Whatever comes next. 
Who's Penny? 
She's a chick Desmond used to date, and now he thinks she fell from the sky. 
So we're gonna go save her life, and she's gonna get us rescued. 
Dude, even if I spoke Korean, it wouldn't make any sense. 
Hey, we'll move faster if we stop talking. 
She might be hurt. 
I'm moving as fast as I can. 
In case you haven't noticed, dude, I'm not exactly the Flash. 
The Flash is pathetic. 
You got something against the fastest man alive? 
You're insane, mate! 
Superman can fly around the entire planet in the blink of an eye. 
Dude, if we're going by a pure foot race, Supes would get dusted by the Flash. 
But why would the man of steel agree to a sodding foot race? 
Uh, for charity? 
The Flash would totally win, 'Cause he can, like, vibrate through walls and stuff. 
Ooh, vibration. 
And what would superman do if he came up against a wall? 
Well, no smashing allowed. 
No flying, no smashing. 
Any other restrictions I need to know about? 
Perhaps we should fit Superman with a pair of Kryptonite ballet slippers... 
The hell? 
Oh, Charlie, duck! 
Dude. 
This way. 
- No, the beacon fell this side of the rise. 
- No, there. 
How about we split up? 
Me and Charlie'll go that way. 
You and Jin go around, and we'll meet up at that ridge over there. 
Uh, you and Jin. 
I'll stick with Desmond. 
You said" duck". 
Sorry? 
You shouted" duck". 
You knew, even before we set off. 
- You knew all this time, didn't you? 
- Aye. 
Well, then, why didn't you say anything? 
Because if I told you the truth, you wouldn't have come. 
Oh, you needed me to come' cause I was part of your vision. 
You thought the only way you could get your girl back was if took an arrow in the head. 
You were gonna sacrifice me. 
If the flashes don't happen exactly how I saw them, the picture changes. 
I was supposed to let you die, Charlie. 
What's that supposed to mean? 
It means it's bloody pointless. 
I keep saving your life, and what good has it done? 
It's just gonna keep happening again and again. 
- Maybe that's the point, yeah? 
Maybe it's a test. 
- A test? 
Like God testing Abraham, except I failed... because I changed what I saw. 
Hey! Hey, can you hear me? 
Hello! 
Dude, she's not moving. 
I'm sorry, Penny. 
I'm sorry. 
I was afraid you'd left without saying goodbye. 
No. 
I nearly took this with me. 
If you're not in a hurry, 
Brother Martin's heading into town in a few hours. He can give you a ride. 
That is, if you don't mind doing some heavy lifting. 
All ten cases are ready to go. 
Desmond there is just getting the last one. 
Thank you, and my father sent the check in advance? 
And please thank him for his generous donation. 
Always a pleasure to see you. 
Goodbye, Desmond. 
I think we should be able to fit it all in the back, and if not, we'll put the rest in the front. 
Is that all right? 
Absolutely. 
You'd better drive safe, Miss. 
This vineyard only makes a limited number 
-... of these cases each year. 
- Is that so? - Aye. 
It's because the monks are lazy. 
You know, it's easier making grape jelly than wine. 
And how do you know so much about monks? 
I'm an ex-monk. 
Really? 
As of last night. 
I was fired. 
- Well, it wasn't that funny. - I'm sorry. 
I've never.. 
I've... 
I didn't know monks could be fired. 
Oh, they can. 
You know, I was told in no uncertain terms that the abbey wasn't where I was meant to end up, just a... step along the path. 
You know, God allegedly has bigger plans for me. 
Something tells me you don't -... entirely believe that. 
- I suspect that's because I don't. 
Well, maybe they're right. 
I mean, just think, if you hadn't gotten fired, we wouldn't have met, and then how could you possibly help me unload these crates in Carlisle? 
Did I say I was coming to Carlisle with you? 
Not yet. 
I mean, of course, if an ex-monk already has plans... then... 
You know, I don't usually get into cars with strangers. 
Well, in that case, I'm Penelope. 
Penny. 
Desmond. 
Very nice to meet you, Penny. 
She's alive. 
Stand back! Get away from her! 
I'm here. 
I'm here, Penny. 
Be careful. 
Just get off, Charlie. 
Sorry, Penny. 
Sorry. 
Uh... Desmond? 
MOHINDER : Where does it come from? 
This quest? 
This need to solve life's mysteries when the simplest... of questions can never be answered. 
Why are we here? 
What is the soul? 
Why do we dream? 
Perhaps we'd be better off not looking at all. 
Not doubting, not yearning. 
But that's not human nature, not the human heart. 
That is not why we are here. 
Yet still we struggle to make a difference, to change the world, to dream of hope. 
Never knowing for certain who we will meet along the way. 
Who among the world of strangers will hold our hand. 
Touch our hearts.

LINDERMAN : You don't love him. 
Everything I've done, I did for them. 
You should've taken the money. 
Why did you take that bullet? 
You could've let it phase right through you. 
- It's okay. 
- Go. 
Forget about me. Save Micah. 
You can get us out of here. 
You can walk us through this wall. 
I don't know if I can. 
You got to do this. 
You can do this.

What does he want? 
Molly. 
What am I thinking now, Parkman? 
Your last thought. 
Lower your gun. 
Shoot me and she dies. 
As long as she's alive, my daughter will never be safe. 
None of them will. 
You'll take the life of one little girl to save another? 
If I have to. 
Taking her life would save thousands. 
And Thompson? 
Did you save thousands of lives by killing him? 
No, just my own. 
Officer Parkman? 
Molly? 
You know this man? 
I told you he was coming. 
He promised to keep me safe. 
That's right. 
And nobody is gonna hurt you.

" How to stop an exploding man" 
NATHAN : I challenge everyone here tonight to inspire by example. 
To fight the battle, no matter the cost. 
The world is sick, spinning out of control. 
But we can heal it. 
Heidi and the boys should be landing in Nantucket any minute. 
Chopper's gonna meet us up on the roof in an hour. 
What is it, Ma? 
It's Linderman. 
He's dead. 
How? 
Someone got to him in his office. 
He was murdered. 
This is a terrible tragedy, Nathan. 
Yes, it is. 
But it doesn't change anything. 
The plan wasn't just his. 
You know that, Congressman. 
Yeah. 
After the explosion, the city is gonna need me, Ma. 
America's gonna need me. 
The world. 
This changes nothing. 
42, Micah's on this floor. 
You go. 
I'm only gonna slow you down. 
I'm not leaving you. 
You'll die if I do. 
I can't go with you, Nik. 
You have to do this alone. 
You have to find Micah. - I can't. 
- You can. 
You were strong enough. 
You always have been. 
I'm coming back for you. 
You stay right here, you understand me? 
Linderman's guards will be all over us if they find Thompson's body. 
Maybe you should've thought of that before you shot him. 
It was self-defense. 
And Molly Walker? 
What's your excuse for nearly shooting her? 
She's dangerous. 
You're gonna need to start trusting me, Dr. Suresh. 
Yes, because that's worked out really well for me before. 
Look... the organization that I used to work for once stood for something. 
Now... it's been corrupted. 
Used to work for? 
The only thing that's important to me now is protecting my family. 
I will never let Molly be used to hurt anyone. 
She can do good in this world. 
I don't think you understand the true nature of this organization. 
And you don't understand how important she is to me. 
It was my antibodies that saved her. 
I'm responsible for her life. 
Hey, there's something wrong with Molly. 
- Hello? 
- Dad. 
Claire, where are you? 
Still in New York. 
I'm with Peter, but there's a problem. 
Ted Sprague's dead. 
Sylar killed him. 
Dad? 
Put Peter on the phone, please. 
He wants to talk to you. 
Hello. 
When you came into contact with Ted, you absorbed his power. 
That's right. 
Well, now that Sylar's absorbed it too, 
I think you may be the only one who can stop him. 
Now all we have to do is find him. 
Any idea where we start? 
There's a tracking system here. 
We're trying to fix it now. 
As soon as we do, we'll find him. 
And if you don't? 
You just stay close to Claire's phone. Okay? 
I'll contact you the second we have a location. 
And whatever you do... you keep Claire safe. 
You understand? 
Yeah. 
What are we doing here? 
I actually believed you. 
You lied to me. 
You said you weren't gonna call him. 
Yeah, I know, but think about it, Claire. 
We can't do this alone. 
No, you think about it. 
We can't trust him. 
Yes, we can trust him. 
Nathan has never let me down. 
Nathan doesn't care about you. 
He doesn't care about anyone. 
He doesn't care about me, and I'm his own daughter. 
We do not need him! 
Yes, we do! 
- Why? 
- Because I'm afraid, okay? 
And I need my brother to help us. 
You lied to me, Peter. 
I trusted you. 
What's the emergency? 
The bomb. 
It's not me, it's Sylar. 
Sylar? 
He killed Ted Sprague, which means he's radioactive. 
And if he explodes... 
I know that this is a lot to process, but it is real, I swear. 
And I don't have a lot of time to find him. 
What do you want me to do? 
I don't know. 
Just... help me. 
Come here. 
Look, if what you're saying is real, then... there's no reason to involve Claire in this. 
It's just too dangerous. 
No, she has to stay with me. 
She's just a kid, Pete. 
If I find Sylar and I'm able to stop him, then she's the only one who can stop me if something goes wrong. 
You're gonna be fine. 
How do you know? 
You told me you- - you could regenerate, that you could survive. 
There's nothing you can do to stop it, Peter. 
They're all gonna die. 
What is it? 
Claire was right about you. 
What are you talking about? 
Claire? 
Claire? 
Peter! 
Claire? 
God, no. 
No, no, no, no! 
This isn't happening. 
How much longer before she's up and running? 
She's not a machine. 
I just gave her the transfusion. 
It'll take some time. 
Well, take too much time, and the city will pay for it. 
Sylar's out there. 
You mean the boogeyman? 
Don't try to get up. 
I can do it. 
I can tell you where he is. 
Okay. 
So... how do we do this? 
I just... 
I think about him in my mind, then I point to him on the map there. 
I need a push pin. 
So you can find anyone in the world? 
You just need to think about them? 
Almost anyone. 
Almost? 
There's only one that I can't. 
Who's that? 
Is it someone bad, Molly, like the boogeyman? 
No. 
He's a lot worse. 
And why don't you want to find him? 
'Cause when I think about him... he can see me. 
Molly... can you think about Sylar now? 
He's there. 
That's the Lower East Side. 
Somewhere around Reed Street. 
Isaac's loft. 
Isaac Mendez? 
The painter? 
Who? 
I've gotta call Peter. 
Why don't you let me answer that for you. 
Hello. 
- Claire? 
- No, this is her grandmother. 
Where is she? 
Where she belongs, with her family. 
Dad! 
I'm her family. 
No, you're the man we gave her to, to look after, to keep safe. 
A job you haven't done particularly well. 
What are you gonna do with her? 
Take her someplace far enough to keep her out of harm's way. 
I suggest you do the same. 
There isn't much time. 
Let me say goodbye to her. 
Dad. 
Claire. 
- Are you okay? 
- Yeah. 
I'm just trying to get away from these people. 
No, no. 
You're better off going with them. 
What? 
! 
She's right. 
You shouldn't be here. 
But as soon as you're safe out of the city, you try and get away. 
Do you understand? 
Yeah. 
I need to find Peter. 
Where is he? 
I don't know. 
They won't tell me. 
That's long enough, dear. 
Tell me you have a plan, Dad. 
I have a plan. 
I love you, Claire. 
I love you too. 
We have a new priority. 
Peter Petrelli. 
We have to find him. 
What for? 
We know where Sylar is. We can go after him. 
No, not without Petrelli. 
He's the only one who can stop him. 
I've come 3,000 miles. I left my pregnant wife at home. 
He's a bad guy. I'm a cop. 
I'm going after him. 
Then he will kill you. 
Yeah, we'll see. 
There you are, sir. 
Thank you. 
- Hi. 
- Hi. I'm Peter. 
I'm your father's new nurse. 
Yes, I've heard. 
I'm Simone Deveaux. 
Nice to meet you. 
Your mother seems to know my father somehow. 
Yeah, she's, uh... yeah, she's, uh- - sorry. 
Yeah, my mother, she's- - she's full of surprises. 
I want to thank you for this. 
I know it's a real hard job. 
Dying is hard. 
What I do, it's just... 
I'm here to help. 
No, you're a real hero to care for a perfect stranger like this. 
This may sound strange, but... your father's last few weeks, his death... it could be beautiful if you let it be. 
Sure, a piece of cake. 
I'm not saying it's not tragic for you. 
I'm just saying... you know, death is the one thing that connects us all. 
Reminds us that's what really important is who we've touched, and... you know, how much we've given. 
Makes us realize that... we have to be good to one another. 
See, your father... he's the real hero. 
Not me. 
Come on, I'll show you the apartment. 
Get you settled in. 
Believe me, if he knew, you'd know, 
There's a look you just can't hide when it first shows. 
What about Nathan? 
Linderman tells me Nathan will be ready to play his part. 
Well, he's been wrong before. 
Meaning what exactly? 
I think that Linderman is betting on the wrong brother. 
We talking about the same Peter here? 
I look in Peter's eyes, I see compassion, empathy. 
But most of all, I see hope. 
This world won't be saved on strength. 
What it really needs is heart, and that's Peter. 
Charles, don't get me wrong. 
I love Peter, but that poor kid can barely get out of his own way. 
He's ruled by insecurities. 
He's weak. 
No, trust me. 
This bomb is going to go off. 
And Nathan is going to be the one the world turns to. 
I don't believe this tragedy's inevitable. 
Well, then... one of us is going to be right. 
And one of us won't. 
Well, I'm glad I won't be alive to see which one that is. 
You are in my prayers, Charles. 
I could use them. 
Good-bye, my dear, dear friend. 
I know you're there, Peter. 
ISAAC MENDEZ'S LOFT NEW YORK CITY 
Hmm, looks like you dropped something. 
9TH WONDERS! HIRO IN THE FUTURE 
A comic book that predicts the future. 
What will they think of next? 
You're kidding. 
This is how Isaac thought I'd die? 
Stabbed by a silly little man! 
Hiro is not silly. 
You should've seen the look on his face when he tried to kill me. 
- You cannot take my brain. 
- Please. 
What would I want with your brain? 
- Where is Peter Petrelli? 
- I don't know. 
Where is he 
Let him go. 
I don't think I'm going to. 
All you have to do is stop time before I cut off his head. 
Do you think you can do your little trick before I can do mine? 
Micah! 
Micah! 
- NIKI : You can't be here. 
- JESSCA : 
Oh, my God! Micah. 
It's all your fault, Niki. 
D.L., now Micah. 
They're both gone... 
because you were weak. 
Micah, please. 
The wrong sister died. 
It should've been you. 
Face it, Niki. 
You're nothing. 
I'm the one they needed. 
Molly, we need to go now. 
Where are we going? 
Officer Parkman called. 
He believes that Sylar- - he believe the boogeyman is on his way. 
No. He's not on his way. 
He's already here. 
I have to get some paperwork. 
I'm not gonna be coming back to my office. 
Helicopter's picking us up from the roof in ten minutes. 
When the jet lands tomorrow morning, you'll be safe. 
But everyone else will be dead. 
How can you do nothing to stop this? 
It's inevitable, dear. 
There's nothing anyone can do about it. 
That's insane! 
Nothing is inevitable. 
The future is not written in stone. 
I'm afraid this one is. 
If everything is so inevitable, then why has she... been trying to keep us apart all these years? 
There are things you simply aren't mature enough to understand yet. 
Yeah, like how you can let your own son die like this. 
Your own brother. 
He's not gonna die. 
Thanks to you, Peter has the ability to survive. 
So he lives... 
and kills millions of people. 
How can you let him be responsible for something like that? 
And how can you live with yourself if he is? 
Claire, I know that it's hard for you to trust me right now. 
But this is all gonna make sense very soon. 
I promise. 
We're offering you everything you've ever wanted, Claire. 
A place to belong... 
A family. 
I already have a family. 
No! 
I know what you're thinking, Nathan. 
Let her go. 
You understand. 
How many times have I saved your ass? 
I'm the only reason that you're still alive. 
That's not me. 
Stop her. 
- Find Micah. 
- What? 
I said stop her. 
That's not me. 
I'm not strong enough. 
Who the hell are you talking to? 
- Mom? 
- Micah? 
Mom, I'm in here! 
It's locked! 
Mom. 
Is it really you? 
It's me, baby. 
It's just me. 
He could be a bad guy. 
He needs my help. 
Okay, we need to get him out of here. 
It's not working. 
They've must have shut it down. 
Okay, I need a lookout. 
Can you do that? 
Stand over here and keep an eye out. 
If anyone comes, tell me straight away. 
Yamagato Industries, Tokyo, Japan 
Hiro... 
Invisibility. 
Always thought that that would be a good one to have. 
I don't understand. 
How is this happening? 
You're alive. 
Is this a dream? 
Am I time traveling? 
Are you doing this? 
Doesn't really matter what it is, does it? 
Only that you're here now. 
Yeah, but I saw you speaking to my mother. 
You know about the bomb. 
You know about everything. 
You came here because you needed to. 
You needed to hear the truth before you could save the world. 
I save the world? 
You've had the power all along, Peter. 
You just needed to learn how to use it. 
Why me? 
Because there has to be one that's good. 
There always has. 
And your heart has the ability to love unconditionally. 
Like I told you. 
In the end, all that really matters... is love. 
I'm tired now. 
Let's get you your rest then, sir. 
Call me Charles. 
Peter! 
Peter! 
Wake up, wake up! 
I must've blacked out. 
How did you find me? 
I told you. 
We have a tracking system. 
And where's Claire? 
She's safe. 
She's with your mother. 
- My mother? 
- Yeah. They're on their way out of the city right now. 
Okay, you need to leave too. 
- I don't think I can control this. 
- No, I'm staying with you. 
You saved my daughter's life. 
I told you I owed you for that. 
Consider this payback. 
Yeah, but if I can't stop Sylar, if I lose it, I could- - 
I'll put you down myself. 
Don't worry. 
I'm a pretty good shot. 
Thank you, Mr. Bennet. 
Call me Noah. 
Come on. 
The guards are coming. 
Dad! 
Micah? 
We have to go. 
- It won't work. 
- Yes, it will. 
Come on! 
Come on, dad! 
You know, it doesn't look like there's many places to hide. 
You sure about this tracking system? 
He's here. Don't worry. 
Look, all right, then that means he's hiding in plain sight. 
What took you so long? 
Haven't I killed you before? 
Didn't take. 
You think I'm gonna let you ruin it all? 
Take all the glory? 
Let ; s go! 
Did you really think you could stop me? 
Mom, Dad needs your help! 
Go back to your family. 
I've got this. 
Wait, no! 
Turns out you're the villain, Peter. 
I'm the hero. 
Sylar. 
You. 
- Hiro! 
- Peter Petrelli! 
You can stop this. 
How? 
I need you to kill me. 
Do it. 
Do it, you are the only one, Claire. 
Tell me there's another way, please. 
Shoot me. 
There is no other way. 
Yes, there is, Claire. 
The future isn't written in stone. 
I took his power, Nathan. 
I can't control it. 
I can't do anything. 
I'm not leaving you, Peter. 
There's another way to end this, and you know it. 
I can't let you die. 
And I can't let everyone else. 
You saved the cheerleader... 
so we could save the world. 
I love you, Nathan. 
I love you too. 
You ready? 
What happened to them? 
Wait! 
Please don't die, Officer Parkman. 
You're my hero. 
We dream of hope. We dream of change. 
Of fire, of love, of death. 
And then it happens. 
The dream becomes real. 
And the answer to this quest, this need to... solve life's mysteries finally shows itself. 
Like the glowing light of a new dawn. 
Let's go home. 
Home where? 
Our house burned down. 
Home is anywhere our family is together. 
You've got a plan, right? 
So much struggle for meaning, for purpose. 
And in the end, we find it only in each other. 
Our shared experience of the fantastic. 
And the mundane. 
The simple human need to find a kindred. 
To connect. 
And to know in our hearts... that we are not alone.

[ gunshot ] [ groans ] [ sobbing ] I love you, Dad. 
I love you, Claire-Bear. 
( Linderman ) I care about the world. 
I just want to heal it. What could you possibly know about healing? 
A few things. 
The company has developed a new tracking system. 
It doesn't rely on isotopes and satellites. 
It just finds you wherever you are. 
We go to New York, we wipe out the Walker System. 
There's someone you need to meet. 
Molly Walker. 
I hear you have an amazing ability. 
They ask me where people are, and I find them. 
( Thompson ) Molly is the only one who can stop Sylar. 
I must stop you. 
Then do it. 
[ gasps ] Do it! 
Kill me! 
You can't. Now I'm gonna have to kill you. 
No! 
Your destiny, Nathan, is to set the course of history after this unspeakable act has occurred. 
Can't you be the one we need? 
That's my boy. 
I explode. 
I wipe out this whole city- - you, Nathan, everyone. 
You explode? 
Like a nuclear bomb. 
( Peter ) If I lose it, you're the only one who can get close enough to stop me. 
Me, Ted- - doesn't really matter. But you have to do this. 
I just miss my family. 
I hope I can make them proud. Dad!

Hello? Yes. Do you fix ancient Samurai swords? 
My name is Hiro Nakamura, and the fate of the world is in your hands. 
( Bennet ) So Peter Petrelli is your uncle. 
( Claire ) You didn't know that? 
There are a lot of things they never told me. 
I thought Peter was the only person who could protect me. 
Now you're here. 
Why did you come here? 
With them? 
The people I used to work for have a tracking system. 
They can find anybody anywhere in the world. 
We came here to destroy it. 
That's the only way we can ever start over. 
And build a normal life. 
Is that even possible? 
I mean, I'm not normal, and they're not normal. 
Everything that's been happening to us has been so monumentally un-normal. 
I mean, maybe Peter's right. 
Maybe we all have a destiny. 
And it's to save the world... 
together. 
( Ted ) I just rode 26 hours from Texas to take down the evil bastards who want me dead, and you're saying I should turn around and go back because of a painting that you saw? 
Yeah. That and a dream. 
He might be nuts, Ted, but he's not lying. 
He believes every word of it. 
( Peter ) They'll take out the tracking system, then you're gonna be free. 
Free? 
I killed people with my powers, okay? 
I didn't mean to, but it happened. 
And now the FBI thinks I'm a terrorist. 
Yeah, but you're not a terrorist. 
You need to get out of town before you become one. 
There's a town in Nebraska. 
Windy Fork. 
Population 15. 
I want you to go there and wait for me to contact you. 
He gave me directions. 
You're sending your daughter with them? 
Claire tells me she has a destiny. 
She stopped Ted from melting down once before and saved all our lives- - she could do it again. 
She could stop both of you. 
You coming?

[ chuckles ] 
Be ready, Nathan. Today you will become a congressman. 
In time, you will lead the country. 
As long as I let this city become a nuclear wasteland. 
And let my brother explode. 
You can't stop that. 
No one can. But it's what comes next. 
And that... 
that is entirely up to us. 
Your father would be very proud. 
Pop would have me committed for even considering this nonsense. 
Clearly, your mother didn't tell you. 
Tell me what? 
Your father was one of us, someone with great power. 
He tried to make a difference in the world. 
He did all he could, and when that wasn't enough... he just gave up. 
Your father was weak. 
My father was my hero. 
And when I win- - ( Heidi ) Nathan? 
I thought you were gonna see the boys before they went to school. 
They wanted to wish you good luck. 
Oh, u-um. 
I'm sorry. 
I-I didn't know you were here. That's all right. I'm just on my way out. 
Mrs. Petrelli, your husband is about to become a very powerful man. 
I would like to give you both a gift to honor his forthcoming victory. 
Something to make the days ahead a little easier. 
What is he talking about? 
I don't know. 
Hmm. I can't believe you let that man into our house. 
Honey... he's my largest campaign contributor. 
He's a thief and a liar and God knows what else. 
And if I win this election, he'll be the reason. 
Why? Because he gave you money? 
Nathan, don't forget who you are. 
I know exactly who I am. 
I'm a man who's being asked to make a hard choice for the greater good. 
And you will. 
And you're gonna do great things. 
But you don't have to sell your soul! 
What? 
What is it? 
Your foot. 
It's moving. 
What? 
[ whispering ] Oh, my God. 
Oh... Nathan. Oh, my God. 
Oh, oh! 
Oh, my God! It's a miracle. 
( Claire ) You know, I've been thinking after we save the world, 
I might go on patrol. 
You know, jumping in front of bullets and dragging people out of burning buildings. 
Not gonna catch me wearing a cape, zipping around with my underwear outside my pants. 
Why do we have to rent a car? 
Can't we just fly to Nebraska? 
In a plane. 
The FBI's got my face all over wanted posters. 
I wouldn't get very far in an airport. 
( Sylar ) Ted's a fugitive. 
I can use that to get his power. 
What is it? 
It's Sylar. 
He's here. He's watching us. 
( Claire ) Right now? 
He knows what Ted can do. 
We need to get off the streets. 
Who's Sylar? 
Would have been nice to have Heidi for the photo op. 
Something happened back at the house. 
She all right? 
She's fine. She's better than fine, actually. 
Oh, oh! Nathan Petrelli! 
Nathan! 
We'll make an announcement after the election. 
What's going on? 
Miracles, Marty. 
( Hiro ) Nathan Petrelli, Nathan! Nathan Petrelli! 
[ man, indistinct ] ( Hiro ) No, I need to speak to Nathan. 
It's all right. 
Mr. Hiro, how are you? Fine. Thank you very much. 
We are trying to stop a bad thing. 
The bomb. 
Big boom. You must help. 
Or bad future will come. 
Bad future? 
Yes, we went there. But I was already dead. 
You become a... 
bad person, Nathan. 
But you can come with us now, help us stop bomb- - together. 
Sorry, Hiro. 
I can't stop it. 
Nobody can. 
It's a pleasure to see you again. 
You already bad guy. 
You are villain! 
Villain! 
Thank you all. 
Villain! 
( D.J. ) That's Petrelli? 
( Jessica ) Yep. 
I don't see Micah. 
Or Linderman. We know they're in town. 
Nathan can tell us where. 
He'll never see us coming.

Mr. Claremont? 
It's me. 
Hiro Nakamura. 
I spoke to you on the phone. 
About my problem.

The Kensei. 
What happened? 
It got cold. 
Frozen. 
Then... snap. 
Can you fix it? 
Depends.

I have a cousin who eats like you. 
He's huge. 
[ chuckles ] So am I. 
You said you like comic books, so... I bought you a stack. 
( Candice ) Anything good? 
The original Silver Surfer number one? 
This must have cost you a fortune! Yeah. 
You're nice. 
Even when you're scary. [ chuckles ] 
I just don't understand why you're working for such a bad guy. 
You could use your power to be a hero. 
Oh. [ laughs ] Okay. 
You're just too young to see how much the world sucks. 
How people can be so mean to each other just because of where they were born or what they look like. 
Mr. Linderman's gonna change all that. 
He's gonna heal the world. 
I didn't know it was sick. 
Ah, Candice. 
Mr. Linderman. 
How are you? ( Candice ) Good. 
And how is our boy? 
Good, sir. Mm. 
I wanna see my mom. 
After today, you can go home. 
I don't believe you. 
I'm sure other grownups talk down to you, Micah. 
I'm not gonna make that mistake. 
I'm gonna look you straight in the eye and tell you one simple truth. 
What you do here today with your incredible ability is going to save many lives. 
What do you want me to do? 
What comes naturally. 
Talking to machines. 
And after that, you'll take me home? 
I'll tell you what. I'll do better than that. 
You do as you're told, and I'll make sure that you and your parents have enough money to live happily ever after. 
So this guy Sylar, he kills people like us? 
Yeah, to take what we can do. 
How does he manage that? 
He rips your head open. 
I say we stick with the plan, get out of the city. [ sirens, brakes screeching ] 
Get out of here. 
Go! Federal agents. On your knees! 
Now! 
Now! 
Let's go! 
There were two others! 
Find them. 
You're under arrest. 
Agent Hanson? 
I've been chasing you all across the country, Ted. 
Y-you know I'm not a terrorist. 
Do I? You blew up a van full of federal agents in Los Angeles. 
But I-I didn't mean to hurt anybody. 
Good. Your next stop- - Guantanamo Bay. 
I'm gonna need a concrete cell lined with lead. 
So everyone is safe! 
We got him, thanks to your tip, Mister... 
Mendez. 
Isaac Mendez. 
I thought I recognized Sprague from his picture in the post office. 
I knew it was my duty to call. 
Especially with it being election day and all. 
Well, you helped us capture a very dangerous man. 
Most people wouldn't take the risk. 
I'm not most people.

Welcome, Ms... 
Baker. 
Do you mind if I take my son into the voting booth with me? 
I'm trying to teach him about democracy in action. 
Oh, what a lovely thought. 
Follow me. 
I've been thinking about how you make yourself look like that. 
You must bend light or something. 
[ chuckles ] How do you know this isn't the real me? 
[ chuckling ] Okay, Micah, it's time to boot up. 
What do you want me to do? 
You can tell computers what to do. 
So I want you to tell this one and all the others here to vote for Nathan Petrelli. 
After this, we do the same thing in 12 other precincts. 
We don't have to go anywhere else. 
It says that they're all networked. 
So from here, I can change every one in the city. 
It says that. 
Yeah. 
How many votes does your boss want him to win by? 
Make it a landslide. 
[ grunts ] [ breathing heavily ] Can I go home now? 
( Jessica ) Sorry to interrupt your big day. 
How did- - 
I didn't think I'd be seeing you again. 
I thought after you tipped me off about Linderman, you'd--I figured you'd be dead. 
And Niki thought that you were gonna take him out. 
Let me guess. 
He made you an offer that you couldn't refuse. 
Something like that, yeah. We came here to find Linderman. 
Who are you? 
He took our son. 
Why would he do that? 
Something to do with you and the election. 
Kidnapping. 
That's a serious accusation. 
I hope you have evidence. 
Cut the crap, Nathan. 
We both know that you hate Linderman as much as we do. 
You were gonna kill him. 
Let us finish the job. 
Look, whatever you think you're getting from this man, he's gonna take back ten times more from you. 
And he ain't never gonna stop until everything you care about is gone. 
If I tell you where Linderman is... 
I have to know that he's not gonna come after us. 
The man took my son. 
He's gonna pay for that in full. 
( Hiro, voiceover ) Takezo Kenzei longed to unite Japan. 
He went to the dragon of Kiso Mountain and asked the dragon to teach him the secrets of the sword. 
The dragon taught him to become the Kensei, the sword saint. 
He fought his enemies and won, saving his people. 
Then the dragon came to his palace, demanding the life of the princess. 
Kensei drew his sword and plunged it into his own heart. 
He handed it to the dragon and said, 
" My love is in here. 
Take it." 
And then he died. 
Tracking system's on the 42nd floor. 
Get a read on someone. 
Yeah. 
You sure there isn't another way? 
The reason I brought you here, Parkman, was so that you could get us to those elevators without raising a ruckus. 
Now, if you can't do that, you might as well give up on your wife and unborn child right now. 
Because no matter how far you run... they will find you. 
Okay. A simple" no" would have done the trick. 
( man ) Good morning, Stanley. 
Okay, I got it. 
Stanley, hey, man. 
I just took my buddy to lunch. 
I forgot my ID. 
Can you buzz us through? 
I don't know you. It's Matt from accounting on 3-6. 
What are you talking about? 
We just went to Ray's for an egg parm. I'm gonna need to see your ID, buddy. 
Stan, come on, buddy, you don't remember? 
Remember on the weekend, I ran into you at the, um... 
at that restaurant? 
( Stanley, thinking ) Where did I take Tanya, Shopsins? 
Shopsins. 
Right? You introduced me to Tanya. 
I did? 
Drank and, God, I hope I didn't- - 
You okay, Stan? 
Remember? 
You were really drunk. 
And you were worried about people finding out about the... 
Uh, you know, the... the porno. 
Oh, hey, yeah, don't worry about it--here. 
You guys go ahead. 
Have a good day. Thanks. 
Thanks, Stan. No problem, sir. 
The password doesn't work. 
They must have changed the protocol. 
Great. 
We have to wait until you can pick it out of somebody's head. 
We gotta move. 
Right now. 
That blonde works for Linderman. 
Let's go. 
Linderman could be on any floor. 
Then we'll search them all. 
Come on. 
Mr. Hawkins. 
Ms. Sanders? 
Relax. 
My friend can hear your thoughts. 
He says we have similar goals. 
Didn't I throw you out a window? 
# # You're responding well to the treatment. 
The important question is how are you feeling, Molly? 
Good, I guess. 
As long as I don't get any more shots. 
The antibodies in my blood are a cure for the virus. 
I'm afraid we will need to continue the treatments. 
I'm all better. See? Look what I can do. 
Just like before I was sick- - 
I think about someone, and I know where they are in my head. 
Right... here. 
How do I know you're not playing a trick just to get out of more shots? 
Now, you've put that pin in this building. 
Is that supposed to be me? 
No. 
It's my other hero. If he's here, can I see him? 
Your other hero? 
The police officer that saved me from the bogeyman. 
Molly... if your power has returned, we can stop the bogeyman so he never hurts anyone else. 
Can you think about it? 
Show me where he is? 
You sure you wanna know? 
[ door opens ] And how's our favorite patient, Dr. Suresh? 
Much improved. Molly says she can locate Sylar. 
We should go after him immediately. 
We will, soon. 
Right now, you need to go away with Molly. We have a helicopter on its way to take you both to a safe location. 
[ elevator bell dings ] ( Bennet ) You'll find Linderman on 51. 
Good luck finding your son. 
Right. 
Nice to see you too. 
How do we take out this tracking system? Erase a hard disk, destroy a satellite link, what? 
You did your part. 
This is mine. 
( Thompson ) Surveillance picked' em up in the elevator. 
What does he want? 
Molly. 
[ thinking ] Good night, Bennet. 
It was Thompson. 
I heard him waiting for you. 
Anybody else? No. 
He's alone. All right, stay here! 
What? No, no, I don't have a gun! 
What am I thinking now, Parkman? 
Your last thought. 
How'd you know he was gonna come up on me? 
We were old friends. 
( Molly ) Dr. Suresh? 
I thought I heard a noise. 
It's nothing, Molly. 
Go back to your room, okay? 
All right, look, whatever happens in here, you gotta know this is the only way our families are ever gonna be safe. 
Why? 
What do you mean? 
What's here? Where's the tracking system? 
It's in there. 
That's the tracking system? 
A kid? We came here to kill a little girl? 
No. I knew it was a person, but I had no idea. 
Lower your gun. 
As long as she's alive, my daughter will never be safe. 
None of them will. Lower your gun, or I will kill you. 
Shoot me, and she dies. 
I'm hurt! 
[ sobbing ] I think it's bad! 
Here, let me help.

( Peter ) Hey, move the car! 
Come on, get moving! 
Is this the only way out of the city? 
No, but it's the fastest. 
This is the sickest thing I've ever seen. 
Did this happen in the accident? 
The top of the guy's head came off! 
How else does that happen? 
You don't wanna know. 
Sylar got him. 
He killed Ted. 
Does that mean Sylar can do what Ted can do? 
He's the one. 
He's gonna wipe out the entire city. 
You've gotta stop him. 
I don't think I can. 
The last time I fought Sylar, he killed me. 
Come on. 
( Linderman ) Yes, we'll send a helicopter to retrieve the Petrelli family. 
Just make sure they're not late. 
Bill. 
Jessica? 
I must admit, I'm quite surprised to see you here. 
Where's Micah? 
She asked you a question. 
You wouldn't even have Micah if it wasn't for me... arranging your relationship. 
Crafting your opportunities. 
What gives you the right to ruin our lives, take our boy from his home, your money? 
You think being rich makes you better than us? 
Well, social Darwinism did play its part. 
I believe destiny to be intrinsic. 
Your destiny... is to give me back my son. 
He's in the building. 
42nd floor. 
I'll go look for Micah. 
Watch him. 
You'll never see him again, you know. 
( D.L. ) How's that? Jessica's gonna kill you for me. 
[ softly ] Open the bag. 
You just caught me preparing for a trip. 
Yes. 
Well, consider this a deposit with more to follow. 
How much more? 
You can't be listening to this! 
Of course she is. 
Like most women whose lives have been ruined by men, all Jessica really wants is security, and money buys that. 
Money's all she's ever really cared about. 
She cares about our son. 
How much? 
5, 10 million? 
Think about Micah. 
You saw that painting. 
All right. 
$ 20 million to kill your husband and walk away. 
He's right, D.L. 
I wanna take the money. 
I really do. 
I would even kill you for it. 
But Niki wouldn't. 
Niki! D! 
You don't love him. 
Everything I've done... 
I did for them. 
You should have taken the money. 
I don't care what he said. 
Me and you getting together- - that was real. 
Jessica wasn't the strong one. 
( Niki ) Baby... [ crowd murmuring ] 
I feel so stupid sitting here. I wanna jump out of this damn chair. 
People don't believe in miracles. 
When the time is right, we'll tell everyone. 
( Marty ) We're ready. 
* Baby, it's all right now [ audience cheers ] Thank you. 
Thank you all. 
Thank you very much for your amazing support. 
A landslide. 
That's what they're calling it. 
[ cheering ] I'm sorry my brother couldn't be with us tonight. 
But I know that Peter cares about this city more than anyone. 
You know, our father always said that we had a responsibility to use what God gave us. 
To help people. 
To make a real difference. 
Pop always made the hard choices for the greater good. 
He believed in that. 
And so do I. Our children deserve that. 
They deserve a better future. A future where they don't have to face their fears alone... but can look into the darkness and find hope. 
I challenge everyone in here to inspire by example to fight the battle, no matter the cost. 
Because the world is sick and spinning out of control. 
But we can help. 
With our help, it can heal. 
With our love, with our compassion, and with our strength we can heal it. 
Let's put aside our differences. 
Let's embrace our common goals. 
Let's do it for our children. Let's show them all exactly what we're capable of. 
Thank you all. 
Thank you very much. 
Thank you. 
Boom. 
My name is Carrie Bradshaw, and I'm a writer. Year after year, my single girlfriends were my salvation. 
And as it turns out, my meal ticket. 
I've been dating since I was 15. 
Charlotte was looking for the perfect love. 
- Trey can't get it up. - Well, almost perfect. 
I'm becoming a Jew. 
- That's our baby. 
So Charlotte and Harry journeyed to China and back for their daughter, Lily. 
Miranda was a disciple of tough love. Bye. Great sex. 
- Steve, I'm pregnant. 
- You're what? 
Carrie. 
I, Miranda Hobbes, take you, Steve Brady... 
And Miranda journeyed to Brooklyn for Brady and Steve. 
Who wants a Popsicle? Oh, man. 
Samantha's love was sex. Lots of sex. 
I'm dating a guy with the funkiest-tasting spunk. Can I cancel my rice pudding? 
Yes, he is interested... So Samantha journeyed to Hollywood with television star Smith Jerrod. 
As for me, I was looking for something big. 
Get in. Mr. Big. 
Turns out when that big love comes along, it's not always easy. 
Just tell me I'm the one. 
And despite all the other chapters of my life no one was ever quite big enough until... 
Carrie, you're the one. 
And just like that, I was. 
Three books and three years later we still feel like those four single girls. 
And even though time had moved us on I managed to stay exactly where I was : 
In love. 
- Thank you. - You're welcome. 
I got a good feeling about this one, kid. Oh, I hope so. 
I've always loved this block. 
Hi, 3C? 
Finding the perfect apartment in New York City is like finding the perfect partner. 
It can take years. - So how many is this? 
- Thirty-three. 
Lucky 33. 
- The worst. 
I just left you a message. 
- And the kitchen's through here. 
That's the window with the best view. 
Thirty-four? 
Lucky 34? 
Well, if anything else opens up, let us know. We're very interested in this building. 
I do have another apartment that's not even on the market yet. Care to take a look? - Sure. 
It's more than you were looking to pay. - How much more? 
Oh, my God. 
I have died and gone to real-estate heaven. 
Just a simple home for two. 
And across the rooftop terrace... 
What, nirvana? 
I live here. Your wife has quite a sense of humor. 
- They're not married. - He's my boyfriend. This way. 
Aren't I a little old to be introduced as your boyfriend? 
Point taken. From now on, you'll be my man-friend. 
- That sounds like a dog. 
- Well, if the shoe fits... 
And this is the master bedroom. 
Uh. It's hideous. 
I hate it. 
Hurts my eyes. 
If you live here, what is there to fight about? 
Hm. - Well, now I understand the divorce. 
- I can build you a better closet. 
Welcome home, baby. 
Can...? 
I got it. 
Okay, let's sign some contracts. 
- Like he was picking up a check for coffee. 
- It sounds perfect. 
Except for the closet, which Big says he can redo. 
And he says the kitchen needs work. Of course, I don't know about that because I keep sweaters in my stove. 
So he bought it and you'll live there with him. 
That's right. 
But he'll own it, so you're keeping your own place, right? 
I haven't figured out the details, but I'm a smart girl. 
I'll figure out something that I'm comfortable with. 
I just wanna be sure that you're being smart. 
But for now, can't you stop worrying for me and just go ahead and feel what I want you to feel, jealous? 
You live in real-estate heaven and I live in Brooklyn. 
New York magazine said Brooklyn is the new Manhattan. 
Whoever wrote that lives in Brooklyn. 
Hey, Hollywood. - Hey. Oh, lady. 
Hi. - How was your flight? 
- Fabulous. - Oh, good. - Good. 
I'm so excited. - Show us. It was a rare occasion that brought all types of New York women together. 
Sorry. 
Blair Elkenn was a waitress turned model turned actress turned billionaire's girlfriend who came home one night to find herself unceremoniously turned out on the street. 
Oh, my God. 
And now she was getting the ultimate breakup revenge : 
An embarrassing and very public auction of all the jewelry he had given her when they were happy. 
There it is. 
My baby. Oh, she's a beauty. When I saw it in the catalog, I said to Smith : 
" This flower ring is the essence of me. 
One of a kind, filled with fire." 
- And a little too much. 
- Exactly. 
Let's go spend some of my hard-earned Hollywood money. 
And now Lot 39, the flower ring. 
That's it. 
We'd like to start the bidding on this at $ 10,000, please. 
Thank you, madam. At 10,000. Fifteen thousand. 
That's not fair. - Bitch. 
The gloves are off. 
At $ 30,000. 
Now it's against you. Thirty-five thousand. - I work hard, I deserve this. 
Forty thousand? Forty thousand, thank you. 
Forty-five thousand. At $ 45,000. 
Now 50,000? Fifty fucking thousand. 
At 50,000. Fifty-five thousand? 
At $ 55,000 against you. 
Would you like to say 60? 
Sixty to our colorful bidder? At 60,000? 
I draw the line at 50. 
I thought this auction would be more fun, but it's kind of sad. 
Isn't it? 
I thought it was just sad for me because I know her. 
But it really is sad, huh? 
And it's funny because they were so happy. 
- Yeah, till they weren't. 
- I know, right? 
We all told her to get married but she didn't wanna listen. 
He'd been married three times before, so she let it ride and then she came home one night and he had locked her out. 
She didn't even have anywhere to live. 
Such a shame. 
After 10 years. 
She was a smart girl till she fell in love. 
I'm thinking I'm going to sell my apartment and put the money towards heaven on 5th. 
You love your apartment. 
I know, but there's plenty of room in the new place and... 
And besides, I... 
I want to make us a life there. 
You know, I... I want it to be ours. It is ours. 
I bought it for us. 
And that's so amazing, but you bought it. 
So really it's your place and if anything were to happen... 
What's going to happen? We're not married, I'd have no legal rights you know, to... Come on, I have to be smart here. 
To this home that I built with you. 
Did you wanna get married? Well, I didn't... 
I didn't think that was an option. 
Why? What, do you wanna get married? 
I wouldn't mind being married to you. 
Would you mind being married to me? 
No. No, not if... 
Not if that's what you wanted. 
I mean, is...? Is that what you want? 
I want you. 
So okay. 
So...? - Really? We're...? 
- No, no. Just get me a really big closet. 
So the other night Big and I were talking about you know, moving in together and our future and, you know, what makes sense as we move forward and well we decided to get married. 
- And I'm deaf. - I'm so excited! 
- Everybody is looking. - Sorry! 
I'm so sorry, everyone but this is my friend and she just got engaged. 
And she has been going out with the man for 10 years. 
I'm mortified. 
There is literally a ringing in my ear. And the big news was about to go bicoastal. 
Samantha Jones. Well, I made a little decision I hope you'll be happy about. 
- Oh, honey, you finally got Botox. 
- I'm telling you, Carrie, you're gonna love it. 
- Well, I'm just saying. 
So last week after the auction, I started thinking about my options. 
- Right. - And, um... 
Well, Big and I decided to get married. 
- Yeah. 
Well, that's great. 
You sounded more excited about the Botox. 
Honey, I am excited for you, but you know me. 
I don't really believe in marriage. 
Now, Botox, on the other hand, that works every time. 
Honey, I... 
I gotta go. 
We can catch up when I'm in town next week. 
Hello. I think I was in shock. 
I mean, it's you getting married. 
This is not some random person, it's you. 
Yeah, I hear you. I thought that after that big mess with Aidan, you'd never wanna get married. 
So I put you in my" we're never getting married" file. 
Now I'm gonna have to take you out of that file. 
Well, I'm sorry about all the extra paperwork. 
You'll get my bill. 
It's just two grownups making a decision about spending their lives together. 
Well, I'm happy for you. 
Oh, and hey, one more thing. 
I want you to be maid of honor. 
- The same way you feel about Botox : Painful and unnecessary. 
- Seventy-four, 75, 76. 
Seventy-six guests. - Seventy-five sounds better. 
A small wedding of 75 guests. 
Seventy-six trombones, yes. 
Seventy-six guests, no. As a wedding gift, Charlotte had given me Anthony Marantino, friend and wedding planner. 
All right. Well, that's... 
Cutthroat. I love it. 
I hope you're this decisive when it comes to location and the dress. 
- I found the dress. - What? When? 
- This is gonna be good. 
- I am so excited. 
Okay. 
Here it is. 
That was the exact reaction I was aiming for. 
It's pretty, but it's... 
It's so simple. It's simple and classic. 
When I saw it, I thought," That is what I should marry Big in." 
- Well, who's it by? 
What's the label? - No one. 
I found it at a vintage shop. 
The bride wore a dress by no one. 
Oh, come on, you know I'm gonna merchandise it up style it up with some shoes. 
- Right. The invitation is fancier than the dress. 
Don't tell anyone. 
" The ultimate single gal, Carrie Bradshaw, will be married in Manolos to New York financier John James Preston come fall." 
- Our wedding's on Page Six. 
- Who would put that in there? 
" Proving to single gals everywhere that there can be a happy ending over 40." 
- Carrie. 
- Congratulations. 
We're putting together our annual age issue and we'd like you to do 40. - Great. 
Who am I interviewing? - No. You. 
I want you to be featured in the magazine as the 40-year-old... 
And here's the brilliant twist. - bride. Wait, I'm... 
I would be in the magazine? 
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity so spare me a week of faux soul-searching and just say yes. In bridal couture. 
Enid, I am so very flattered, but honestly, I... 
Carrie, Vogue designers. 
Vogue photographers. 
Vogue airbrushing. 
Nod your head. 
Yes. 
It will be a sensation. We're calling it" The Last Single Girl." 
Well, I'm hardly the last single girl. 
No, but 40 is the last age a woman can be photographed in a wedding gown without the unintended Diane Arbus subtext. 
I thought the issue was" Great Style at Every Age." 
Style, yes. 
Bride, no. 
- Is that better? 
- Just your typical Wednesday. 
Hanging out with old friends like Stanford Blatch and new friends like Vera Wang. 
She's looking at home for someone who didn't think she had the bride gene. 
- Well, I guess with the right man... - And the right dress. 
When I get married, I'm wearing something like that, only bigger. 
Beauty. 
And Carolina Herrera. 
Nothing fancy, but it's beautiful. 
Good work. Great, let's do it. 
Come on, look at the model. 
And finally, Vivienne Westwood. 
A dress so special it could bring a wedding tear from even the most unbelieving of women. 
And then, the impossible happened. 
And just like that Vivienne Westwood kicked my sweet little suit's ass. 
Are you the last person in New York still taking out library books? 
Oh. That's an oldie. 
But some of your classmates are, like Voltaire, Napoleon. 
I have yours. Okay, here's Napoleon. 
" My dearest Josephine, I wake consumed with thoughts of you." 
Typical short guy. 
Gives it all away upfront. 
- Why are you reading this? 
- It's research for my new book. - Oh. 
What's it about? 
- Love. 
I used to write about finding love. 
Now I wanna write about what happens after you've found it. 
Interesting. 
- What happens? 
- Mm. Stay tuned. 
Oh, here, listen. 
It's Beethoven. 
Bring it, Ludwig. 
" My thoughts go out to you, my immortal beloved. 
I can live only wholly with you or not at all." 
Good stuff. 
" Be calm my life, my all. 
Only by calm consideration of our existence can we achieve our purpose to live together. 
Oh, continue to love me. Never misjudge the most faithful heart of your beloved. 
Ever thine. 
Ever mine. Ever ours." 
Have you ever written me a love letter? 
Does a love fax count? 
- Oh, I'm sure my secretary sent you one at some point. 
What can I tell you, baby? It's not my style. 
Besides, those guys had to write. 
They were separated from their loves by wars and hundreds and hundreds of miles. 
I'm right here. 
Hello. 
- You make me very happy. 
- Yeah, yeah. Put it in writing. 
With my mind prenuptially preoccupied, I became delinquent with my library books. 
So now the tragic love stories of Wuthering Heights and Love Story were going to cost me more than a few tears. 
Excuse me, which way is the wedding? Up the stairs. 
Where is the waiter with the check? Jeez, Miranda, relax. 
Magda hasn't even finished yet. 
I still have a brief to work on when I get home. 
- I have to go to the bathroom. 
- I'll take him. Thank you, Magda. 
We're gonna wash that beautiful face. 
Come, darling. 
We can't let the hard-working nanny finish her supper? 
I'm sorry, I'm exhausted. 
Brady woke me up at 5 a.m. 
- Hey, he woke me up too. 
- Yeah. 
We gotta stop letting Brady come into our bed. 
You got milk on your top lip. What now? 
- It's like you're always criticizing me. 
- I am not. 
You wanna go through life with foam on your lip and no one ever telling you? 
Anything you wanna tell me? 
Hm. Is there anything you wanna tell me? 
- Yeah. 
Yeah. - Wait. Wait. 
Don't come already. 
- Yeah. 
- No, wait. 
Get on top. Let's just get it over with. 
I mean, we gotta get up in four and a half hours. 
We never have sex and you wanna get it over with? 
- Steve, we have sex. 
- How often do you guys have sex? 
- Sex. - Miranda, please. 
- What? She's 3. 
She doesn't know what it means. 
I'm 41 and I still don't know what it means. I know, but she is repeating everything. 
If I'd known the girl talk was gonna be on lockdown, I wouldn't have flown 3000 miles. 
No, we can talk. Let's just not use that word. 
Fine. 
How often do you guys? - Color? - Thank you. 
Well, I can't color enough. I could color all day every day. 
If I had my way, I would use every crayon in my box. 
We get it. You love to color. Why are you asking? 
Well, last night Steve and I were coloring, and I was just about to... 
I'm sorry, there's no crayon equivalent. 
And he wanted to switch positions and I said : 
" Let's just get it over with." 
- He kept trying to make it last longer. 
- This is bad? - It is when you have a full-time job. - I have a full-time job. 
You don't also have a 5-year-old, play dates, PTA meetings and a mother-in-law in a rest home with advancing Alzheimer's. 
We're just going through a no-coloring phase. 
- It comes and goes, right? 
- Every couple is different. 
Harry and I make love two, three times a week. 
- Great, now I feel worse. - Well, when was the last time for you? 
- Six months ago. 
- Oh, my. It sounds long. 
- But... But that's a dry spell. 
Hey, Carrie. 
What about you and Big? 
I told. Tell. Mm-mm. 
But I will tell you this. 
John? 
- Hey. - Come here. 
Totally outside the lines. 
Well, send it to Smith Jerrod at the office address. 
- I got a gift for you. 
- So far, I like it. 
How'd...? 
Wait. That was you on the phone at the auction. 
- I knew how much you wanted it. 
- But I was gonna buy it for myself. 
Well, I wanted to give it to you. 
For our anniversary. 
We met five years ago today. 
Right. Do you like it? 
Well, just to be clear, this is a ring with diamonds it's not a diamond ring, right? 
Well, in that case, I love it. 
It's my second favorite thing I've ever found in there. 
Now, my gift is a little bit more oral. 
And that is how Samantha learned she had a new neighbor. 
From then on, night after night while Smith got his beauty sleep Samantha found something more interesting to watch than TiVo. 
Open them. 
Double doors. So far, so good. 
Oh, my God. 
- Oh, you did me proud, mister. 
It's love at first sight. 
Oh, my. 
Here. Wait. 
Hold this. 
Now I believe this is all really happening. 
I can't believe it sold so fast. 
Hey, that's the food. Will you buzz them in? 
I'm gonna get started on the closet. 
I should be done in about 17 years. 
Pink Post-it : take. 
Purple : toss. 
Yellow : storage. Oh, you're very good friends. 
Lily, look who it is. Aunt Samantha. 
- What are you doing here? 
- A lot of shit went down in this place. 
- Remember this? 
Banana clip. 
While I run over to see your mother tomorrow maybe you could take Brady by the first birthday party alone. 
I had sex with someone else. 
And you're so amazing and I don't know how I could do that to you. 
Scout, off. 
Miranda, it's still me. 
Is it? 
Steve. I just... 
- That's what I said. 
- Yes, it's sad. 
But I'm not gonna make it any sadder by staying at a bad hotel while I look for a place. Could you pass the salt? 
Plus, I have to be downtown and close to Brooklyn. 
Well, I don't really know if this question is allowed but how is Steve handling this? 
Miranda, honey, are you sure you wanna do this? 
Even if I could get my mind around that justification, it's the cheating part. 
Thank you for being you. 
Charlotte made love to Harry four times that week. 
Okay. Wedding crunch time. 
We need to get really serious here. Okay, not now. 
I just got an e-mail from our contractor. 
He's pushed the move-in date yet again. 
- I gotta write this guy and... - No, no, no. No. 
Wedding before contractor, all right? 
Unless you're planning to invite him, which would make the guest list 201. 
Two hundred? 
Jesus, Carrie, it went up again? 
- It's the dress. - You said 75 people. 
How can I explain this? 
Hey. 
How you doing on your vows? A reminder. 
You'll be saying these in front of a lot of people, so the pressure is on. 
I have to finish this. Up. 
- Hey. - I don't have time for this. 
- You're not taking it seriously. 
- No, no, I'm not. It is a circus. 
Two hundred people? Page Six? 
This is my third marriage. 
How do you think that makes me look? 
I didn't know that was even an issue. 
So why didn't you say anything sooner? 
- You wanted all of this. - Well, yeah. 
- But don't you want...? 
- I want you. 
That's what I want. 
I could have just gone down to city hall. 
I think it's too late for city hall now. Well, no, I wasn't suggesting that... 
See, that's the face I've been trying to avoid. 
Come here. 
Now, I know it's tradition at the rehearsal dinner for the maid of honor to reveal embarrassing things about the bride. 
But in our group, we never kiss and tell. 
- So I'd like to make a toast to the groom. - There's a word he's heard before. 
- Who's that guy again? - Karl. He's a partner at the firm. 
Now, there were times when we had our doubts about this gorgeous man. 
But after careful observation over the last hundred years my doubts are over. 
So here's to the groom a man who finally got" Carrie-d" away. 
Aww. 
- Cheers. 
- That was really nice. Thank you. 
There's nothing like an illegal Cuban cigar after dinner, huh? 
- Exactly. 
Well, you're quite a guy. - Oh, my God, there's a cab. 
Steve. - I don't wanna bother you all. 
- You're not bothering us. 
But I need to talk to Miranda. 
Samantha, could you ask her to come out? 
Sure. 
Hey. 
I haven't talked to you all night. 
Steve's here. 
Hey, guys. 
Would you give us? 
Yeah, sure, going in. 
You're all right? 
You didn't leave me any choice. 
You only talk to me in front of the baby and I can't say anything. 
What could you possibly have to say that could make it any better? 
You broke us. What we had is broken. 
What the fuck is happening? 
Hey. 
- Are you all right? - No, I'm not all right. 
You two are crazy to get married. 
Marriage ruins everything. 
I thought you'd skipped out on me. 
Hey, is everything okay? 
Yeah. 
I'm just tired, I guess. All right. 
- I always knew she would marry Big. 
- Oh, you did not. 
- That's crazy. - Yes, I did. 
You thought that after the second breakup? - Yup. - After the fifteenth? 
Ha-ha. That's hilarious. We broke up a lot. 
Yeah, but after the breakups comes the hot make-up sex. 
Hey, you wanna get that? 
- Now say something. - Sex. 
Are you sure she's not my child? 
- Hello? - It's me. 
Oh, my God, did you just hear Lily? 
- I need to talk. 
- What? 
I'm sitting here trying to write these vows and... 
Is this something we really wanna do? 
Hey, you know what? You guys, it's Big. 
I'm gonna... 
Get some sleep, groomie. 
- What's the matter? 
- It's just everything is great as it is. 
- I don't wanna screw it up. - You won't. 
I screwed it up twice before. 
Here's the thing. 
This is me you're marrying tomorrow. 
Me. It's nobody else. 
It's me and you. 
And do you wanna hear the great news there? 
We've both already done everything we can to screw it up. 
- Is that a smile I'm hearing? 
- Yeah. 
It sounds to me like you've got a bit of writer's block on the vow front. 
Yeah. 
And I find, you know, as a professional writer that it's best to just, you know just stop thinking about it so much and go to bed. 
And in the morning... 
- You'll know what to do. - Exactly. 
And if not, then just write this : 
I will love you. 
Simple, to the point and I swear I won't even try to take credit for it. 
So you're gonna go to bed now, right? 
Okay. Good night. 
I'll see you tomorrow. 
And hey it's me and you. 
Hello? 
Hello? 
Who let the dogs out? 
Get these dogs out of here! 
That's all we need is the lift of a leg on the train of a dress. 
Could you open this door, please? 
- I'm trying to find out... - Oh, my God. 
Come on, lift it up. Let's go. 
Hey, it's Carrie. Leave me a message. 
- See you then. Bye-bye. 
- Red and black. 
- Okay, I'll see you there. 
- Where's black? - Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming. 
- You're following the red. 
- I'm coming. Okay. 
Come on. Let's go. - Ready? 
There's the bride. Look, she's dressed like a princess, do you see? - Can you hold that? 
- Oh, yes. 
Thank you. 
Okay. Come on, scootch over. 
It's like pushing a cream puff through a keyhole. See you at the library. 
- Hey, it's Carrie. Leave me a message. 
- Why haven't you called me back? 
Call me as soon as you get this. 
No more wedding guests on these stairs, understand? 
Bridal party only. 
We've got a problem. 
They're not here. 
- They're probably stuck in traffic. 
- Both of them? 
Leave me a message. 
- I can't go in without you. 
Baby this whole bride-and-groom thing has really got me thrown. 
I need to know that it's still us. 
Just you and me. Like you said. 
- I was putting it on. - I know. Good job. 
Beautiful. Come on, baby. 
Turn around, let me see you. 
- Hello. You guys look great. 
Ready. We're ready. 
He's not here. 
What's happening? - Big's not here. 
- But we're 25 minutes late. 
Well, did anybody call him? 
Well, give me a phone. 
Somebody give me a phone. 
- All right, I don't know how to work this. 
- Here, sweetie. Thank you. 
- Why haven't you been answering? - Because I don't know where my phone is. 
So, what's going on? 
Where are you? 
I was out front. 
I just left. 
I can't do this. 
Oh, my God. 
Carrie? 
- He's not coming. 
Oh, my God. 
Get me out of here. 
- You take her, I'll take care of all of this. - All right, all right. 
Here we go. 
It's a one-way street. 
By the time we go around the block, she'll be gone. 
There's no one behind us. Turn around. 
Pull over. Carrie. 
I freaked out for a minute, but I'm ready now. 
I knew you would do this! I knew it! 
- Carrie, I'm sorry. 
- I am humiliated! 
I'm sorry. 
I'm... I'm sorry, Carrie. Come on. 
Come on. 
- Carrie, wait, I'm sorry. Carrie... - No! 
No! 
Come on, we're gonna get in the car. It's all right, it's all right. 
I thought I would still be in extreme pain. 
I feel nothing. 
Yes, I'm still jilted. 
What the hell got into him? He was perfectly fine at the dinner. 
I knew it when he called last night. 
- I could tell. - Then why didn't you say anything? 
I didn't wanna believe it. 
I didn't even wanna say it out loud. 
- Now I have nowhere to live. - You'll stay here. 
Forever. 
Maybe you should eat something. 
- Anyone? Hungry? 
- No. I can never go back there again. 
How am I gonna get my clothes? 
Oh, honey, I can hire people to do all that. Anything you need. 
A hit man? 
I have nothing to wear but a wedding gown. 
You have your honeymoon clothes here. Well, there's the silver lining. 
A honeymoon at a romantic Mexican resort that's prepaid on my credit card because I wanted to surprise the man who jilted me. 
Worse comes to worse, I'll say there was a death or something. Wasn't there? 
Charlotte. 
Come here. Come here. 
I did something really bad, I think. 
I said something to Big at the rehearsal dinner. 
What do you mean? 
It was right after Steve showed up. I was upset. 
Big came over to me, and I said something like : 
" You're crazy to get married." 
It just came out. 
- Do you think it's totally the reason? 
- No. 
Big has been weird about marriage for years. 
- I keep thinking I should tell Carrie. 
- No, no, no. This is a bad time to even mention it. 
No, no, no. 
Find another time later. 
Uh-huh. Well, it turns out, I couldn't get her out of the honeymoon, but I got us in. 
Mexico, here we come. 
I can't go to Mexico. 
I have a job. 
Smith Jerrod, with a J. 
- Make sure that the car is there... 
Welcome to Mexico. 
I'm sorry, I'm confused. I'm waiting for a Mr. and Mrs. Preston. 
Honey, you'll be waiting a long time. 
We'll talk. 
You get that side. 
Where are we gonna put these? Here. 
No more honeymoon stuff. 
This is very important. 
Here she comes. 
All of them. 
You slept the whole day. 
So? 
You have to eat a little breakfast. I'm tired. 
Well, eat something, then you can go back to sleep. 
- Oh, thank you, Paulo. - Sure. 
With all this gorgeous fresh food, you're gonna eat that pudding crap the entire trip? 
It's the only thing in the pantry that's totally safe. 
See?" Made in Poughkeepsie." I didn't wanna chance it. 
It's a five-star resort. 
It's Mexico. 
Carrie. 
Is there coffee? 
Yeah. Yeah, of course. 
The sun feels nice. 
Jesus, honey, wax much? 
What? 
I didn't know I was gonna be wearing a bathing suit. 
- What are you talking about? 
- I forgot to wax. 
- Since when, 1998? 
- I've had other things on my mind. 
I could be on death row and not have that situation. 
Well, when you're married, you have a different set of priorities. 
Oh, honey, don't blame marriage. 
This one's married and she's not growing a national forest. 
How do you even cross your legs? 
Let me make you a spa appointment. 
Any thicker, and you won't be able to find it. 
So, what, it's my fault? 
I let the sex go out of my marriage. 
I deserve what I got? 
- Thanks for understanding. 
Hey, let's go down to the hotel for dinner tonight. 
- Really? - Yeah. 
I gotta do something to pull me out of my" Mexi-coma." 
- My name is Felix, I'll be your server. 
- Felix, we'll start with cuatro margaritas. 
Oh, no, I'm not drinking. Just bottled water. 
- I'll drink hers. 
- May I have your room numbers? 
Uh, number 3. Very good, Mrs. Preston. 
That was like taking a bullet. 
Charlotte has pudding in her Prada. 
- Will I ever laugh again? - Yes. - When? 
- When something is really, really funny. 
Thank God for that mariachi band or I'd be able to hear my own thoughts. 
Thank you. 
He couldn't get out of the car. 
After 10 years of what he already put me through he couldn't make the effort and get out of the car. 
I made the effort. 
I put a bird on my head. 
- Is that what that was? - Yeah. - I thought it was feathers. 
- It was a bird. 
- It was beautiful. 
- Beautiful. He's a bad guy. 
Always was. 
- Bad guys do bad things. 
- And good guys do bad things. 
The good guys screw you and the bad guys screw you. The rest of them don't know how to screw you. 
- Trust me, I've done the legwork. 
- After everything I know after 20 years of everything we've learned I threw it all away for the thrill of putting his name on the honeymoon suite. 
If I met me now, I wouldn't know me. 
As long as we're going down this road I can't believe that my life revolves around a man. 
On what planet did I allow that to happen? 
But you love him. 
Does that mean saying his name 50 times more a day than I say my own? 
Does it mean worrying about him and his needs before me and mine? 
Is it all about the other person? Is that love? - No, that's marriage. 
I wanted to buy this for myself. 
That meant something to me, to be able to do that. 
- And then he buys it for me. 
- Because he knew how much you loved it. 
Yes, but now every time I look down at it, I see him not me. 
Technically, we're on my honeymoon. No, I think we're on their honeymoon. 
Yeah, it's all so hot three days in. 
" Mailbox full." Yeah, I'll bet it is. 
- There's no time like the present. 
I'm not ready to face it all yet. 
Hey. 
I'm going for a run and then to the gym for Pilates. Anybody wanna...? 
- Hi. 
- Hey, good news. 
I got an e-mail from your buyer's attorney. 
They're willing to sell you back your old apartment at the escalated price and" are willing to vacate by the time you return pending an additional financial offer." 
Well, apparently you can go home again, but it'll cost you. 
- Let's work on getting your things there. 
- Wow you two could rule the world. 
After her workout, Charlotte couldn't help but think how truly blessed she was. 
Sweetie, what's...? 
It's locked, she's mopping. 
Try the... 
- Did you just...? - Shut up, shut up, shut up! 
And just like that Charlotte" Poughkeepsied" in her pants. 
Oh, my God. 
There was no better time I could think of to hire an assistant. 
Um, no. 
I do not lift boxes. 
Yeah, definitely, no. 
I would love a career in fashion. 
Oh. 
This is not nonfat. 
Oh. I love your books. 
- Little bit. Never made it to bed last night. 
But I type like a motherfucker! 
I have a degree in finance from Princeton and I've been assistant to a V.P. at Merrill Lynch. 
That's impressive. 
And, Paul, why do you think you're right for this job? 
- So you're from St. Louis? 
Louise from St. Louis. And you have a degree in computer science? 
- Well, good for you. I can barely text. 
- Have you ever been a personal assistant? 
- No, but I'm the oldest of six kids so I'm sure I can handle anything you got. 
Six kids, what's that like? - Crowded. I had to move to New York just to get some room. 
In a one-bedroom apartment with three roommates. Well, aside from the space issue, why'd you move to New York? 
To fall in love. 
- What? 
That's corny, right? 
- No. No, no, it's... 
It's just very honest. 
Well... 
So Louise from St. Louis, I just have one more question. 
Okay. How does an unemployed girl with three roommates afford the Patchwork Denim Bowley Louis Vuitton bag? 
It's like Netflix for purses. - How can I not know about this? 
- Girl, stick with me. I'll hook you up. 
And did she hook me up. 
Hi. This is Louise. I'm calling for Carrie Bradshaw. 
Yes, she received your invitation, but she will be unable to attend. 
Thank you. 
Put that over there. 
After only three days I began to think of her as Saint Louise from St. Louis. 
Ain't nothing in there for you. 
And as I moved back into my old apartment Miranda searched for a new one, downtown. 
- Yeah. New York magazine says this is the new up-and-coming neighborhood. 
- Okay, maybe down that way? 
A U-Haul. Coming or going? 
- Going. Oh, boy. I'm gonna check it out. 
And there in old Ukrainia, Miranda found her new apartment. 
" And there they remained for the rest of their days for the birds were constantly on guard and the women could not so much as step one foot out the door. 
And Cinderella and the prince lived happily ever after." 
You know that this is just a fairy tale, right, sweetheart? 
I mean, things don't always happen like this in real life. 
- I just think you should know that now. 
- Again. 
And another one bites the dust. 
- Hi. - Hi. 
Mommy's home. 
Thanks for watching Lily while I went to the doctor. 
- Oh, sure. Everything okay? 
- Mm-hm. - I'm pregnant. 
- How? 
You know how people always say that when you stop trying, it can happen? 
And my doctor says that she knows other couples who have adopted and then they get pregnant. 
- Sweetie. - Carrie, I'm pregnant. 
I guess in certain houses, fairy tales do come true. 
- You seem kind of distant. 
- Distant? You're still in me. 
- Do you wanna talk about it? 
- When have I ever wanted to talk about it? 
I'll talk about it. Your best friends got screwed over by their guys. 
How could you not be distant? 
It's more than that. 
Lately, I haven't been feeling a connection to... 
- What, me? 
- No. 
What life here? Seriously. 
All I do is work and you run off to New York every chance you get. 
Well, not every chance I get. 
Only for the A-list things. 
And my managing you, it's... It's getting to be too much. 
I'm starting to resent it. 
Well, for the first three years, it was all about you. 
I know. That was so much more fun. 
Carrie Bradshaw's web page is a mess. 
So is Carrie Bradshaw. 
Hey, when are we gonna get to the really important stuff, like unpacking my closet? 
One thing at a time. 
You ever gonna answer any of these e-mails? 
- Yes. - When? 
- Now? 
- Okay. 
- Well, I'll read and you tell me what to do. 
- Okay. 
Oh, shit. 
That's him, right? 
Delete. 
And isn't there some cyberspace place that you can send those so that I never have to see an e-mail from him ever again? 
Do that, please. You sure you wanna end all communication with him? 
I can't believe you're even dressing up. 
All the parents in Brady's school dress up. It's fun. 
Fun thought up by a group of non-working mothers with nothing else to do all day. 
All right, what do they got? 
Witch and sexy kitten. That's it. 
You just said a mouthful there, sister. 
Maybe I should wear this and a briefcase, and go as myself. 
I got an e-mail from Big. " I don't know what to say." 
- Uh, then don't send an e-mail. 
- What were you expecting? 
And in the subject box, two words : 
-" I'm sorry." 
- Ugh. 
Steve is all about the" I'm sorry." 
" I'm sorry" e-mails," I'm sorry" voice mails" I'm sorry" flowers," I'm sorry" cards. 
How about, don't do anything to be" I'm sorry" for? 
Well, maybe he's sorry. 
Well, maybe so is Big. 
Point taken. 
Hey, you're scaring the women. 
It's gonna take a little more than that to scare me after what I've been through. 
I still cannot believe this happened to me. 
I mean, I... I know it happened. 
But I just... 
I can't believe it happened. 
I lay awake at night going over every detail of that last week in my head. 
Carrie, there's a detail about that last week I've been meaning to tell you. 
- At the rehearsal dinner... - And then I saw it. 
The only thing scary enough to scare me after what I'd been through. You look great. 
You look amazing. So that's the worst of it. Wait, wait, wait. 
" The wedding of Carrie Bradshaw and John James Preston was canceled as this issue went to press. 
Bradshaw is..." 
Bradshaw is what? Wait... 
" Bradshaw is still single and living in New York City." 
I didn't wanna buy it but I figured it was one less Vogue in New York. 
Louise. 
Oh, my Lord. 
I didn't even recognize you. 
I'm feeling that look on you though. 
- And I am feeling that Chanel on you. 
- Mine till Tuesday. 
- All right, so... 
Already? 
- Your new number, area code 347-85... 
- Ho... Ho... 
Hold it. 
347? Oh, no. No, I'm a 917 gal, always have been. 
I tried. It's no longer available. 
Now you're 347. 
Samantha Jones. Carrie Bradshaw. 
Or I used to be. Talk to me. 
Well, I want the old New York with my old 917 and my old will to live. 
Old New York, new New York. Honey, at least it's New York. 
Another hard thing about being in L. A : 
My sex-on-a-stick next-door neighbor. 
- I can't stop looking at him. - Looking? 
After seeing Steve's face at the rehearsal dinner, I could never... 
Oh, but you should see this guy. 
Every night sex with a different partner. 
He's like me five years ago. 
- Yeah. 
When I was a 917. 
And in an effort to stay out of the house and out of trouble Samantha went shopping. 
Rescue a puppy today? 
- She needs a good home. 
Interested? 
- No. 
And just as Samantha convinced herself that the dog wasn't for her... 
She's been fixed, but she hasn't lost the urge. 
And because Samantha couldn't get off she got things. 
What would happen if these were to magically disappear? 
- Yeah, I know where you live. 
- For a pair like this, I could move. Wait, Carrie, not that one. 
I don't know, maybe... 
Maybe you're only allotted a certain amount of tears per man and I used mine up. 
Yeah, I know how you feel. 
There were two broken hearts in my walk-in. 
Louise, we need a cocktail. 
And it threw me so hard. Because, you know, I thought Will... 
He said he loved me and all, but he didn't think that I was the one. 
You see that? 
That's love. 
And I'm bringing it to me all day long. 
Excuse me. 
Oh, I remember that smile. Who's the guy? 
Someone I just met. 
He wants me to meet him for drinks. 
Oh, that's a booty call. 
No, it's not. He's a waiter, he just got off work. 
Louise. 
Now, I may not get texts, I may not send texts, but trust me. 
The subtext of that text? 
Booty. 
But if he meets me, then it's not a booty call, right? 
All right, then. 
Enjoy yourself. 
That's what your 20s are for. 
Your 30s are to learn the lessons. 
Your 40s are to pay for the drinks. 
Well, in that case, I'll take another one. 
It's all about the desk. 
And it better come because I'm using my new book advance to pay the fancy decorator. 
I think it is so great that you're redoing your entire apartment. 
Yeah, well, out with the old and oh, in with the overpriced. 
Hey. 
Harry called me and mentioned that you're not running. - Why'd he do that? 
- Because he loves you and he's concerned. 
There's nothing to be concerned about. 
Did the doctor say that it's not safe or something? 
No. She said because I'm already a runner, it's fine. 
So then, why are you not...? 
- It's a miracle I'm even pregnant. - Okay. 
I have everything I ever wanted. 
I am so happy that I'm terrified. 
Nobody gets everything that they want. 
Look at you. Look at Miranda. 
You're good people and look at what happened to you. 
Of course something bad is gonna happen to me. 
Sweetie you shit your pants this year. Maybe you're done. 
You run every day, that's what you do. 
You can't stop being who you are because you're afraid, right? 
All right. Okay. 
Here we go. 
Okay. 
And as the last of the autumn leaves fell away so did Charlotte's fear. 
By the time the first snow fell, Charlotte got her stride back. 
Are you sure you don't want me to R.S.V.P. to any of these holiday parties? 
No, I am perfectly happy spending time alone. 
You sure? Because this looks like a good one. Go. 
Seriously, you're gonna miss your plane, go. Okay. 
But first... 
Merry Christmas. 
- You didn't have to. - It's just something silly. 
Oh. - Oh, Louise from St. Louis. 
- You said you never saw it. 
Well, jeez. 
Now I feel bad. 
If I had known we were exchanging gifts I would have bought you one two weeks ago and hidden it here. 
- That is not what I think it is. 
- I don't know, open it. 
Oh, my God. 
My very own Louis Vuitton? That's right. No more rental for you. 
New Year's Eve and a cup of noodles. 
So you remember what you're gonna say at midnight? 
- Yeah. Except you're gonna say it much more excited than that. 
- You're gonna say," Happy New Year!" 
And you say that and then you kiss. 
All right. 
Did you remember to pack the Batman that Santa brought you? 
I think it's in the kitchen. Oh, you gotta have the new Batman, huh? 
We could go someplace on your side of the bridge. 
No. 
Thank you. 
Miranda, I never meant to hurt you. 
- Okay. - Put your hat on. - Yeah. 
- It's snowing out. - Here you go. 
- I'm gonna bring Batman. - Okay. 
Happy New Year. Happy New Year. 
Kiss. 
All right, I'll see you tomorrow. 
This is my new... 
You know what we're gonna do? 
- Hello? 
- Good night. 
Good one. 
- It's almost time. 
Happy New Year. 
Are you suggesting something? I like Steve. 
I didn't know if it was the fashion or the fact that the four of us were together again but for the first time in a long time I felt like myself. 
Well, let's get a cab, okay? 
I'm absolutely starving. I don't know what... 
Murder! - Murder! Murder! 
- God, I miss New York. 
And a couple of weeks later, I met Saint Louise's St. Louis boyfriend, Will. 
Over Christmas, they realized how much they loved each other. 
- I'm Carrie. - Will. Just in time for Valentine's Day. 
- So, what's the V-Day plan? 
Well, Miranda and I are going to dinner and then a very violent slasher movie. 
- Perfect. - You? 
There is a whole lot of love in this room. 
Is it me or is Valentine's Day this year on steroids? No. 
We just played for the other team. Good evening. 
I deserve what I got. 
Running all over New York believing that I'm finally getting my happy ending. 
" See? Love does conquer all. 
Look at me in my one-of-a-kind wedding gown marrying the love of my life." 
- Would you like another bot...? - Yes. 
- Yes. 
And Miranda, in that article, I did not say" we" once. 
No. 
The whole article was" I think" and" I want." 
- It was from your point of view. 
- Yeah, exactly. My point of view. Exactly. 
The whole wedding was my point of view. 
I let... I let the wedding get bigger than Big. 
And I bumped into Big and I said that you two were crazy to get married. 
Here we go, your Shiraz. 
Okay, great. 
Thanks so much. 
Steve had... I have been going over this and over this in my mind for five months. 
And for five months, you kept a secret like that? 
- I tried to tell you once, but then... 
- Once? 
You tried to tell me once? 
You should have tried to tell me every single day. 
I know. 
I was waiting for the right time. 
There is no right time to tell me that you ruined my marriage. 
It just happened. I wasn't thinking. 
- Carrie, please don't go. 
- You know what I think hurts the most? 
Is that you kept a secret from me. 
And I have never, ever kept a secret from you. 
Ever. No, I'm lying. 
For the last five months I've been thinking that it is a huge mistake that you left Steve. 
There. How does it feel? 
Excuse me. 
Excuse me. 
Any minute now. 
Hey, babe, it's me. Pick up. Pick up. 
All right, it's 7 : 20. I'm still at the studio. We're behind. 
I'm gonna be a little bit late. 
Sorry. Bye. 
Forty minutes later sushi, Samantha, still no Smith. 
This is bullshit. 
And the other woman. 
I'm home. 
- Man, that was a long day. 
- You're three hours late. Bummer, I know. 
Did you eat? 
Why are you so upset? I called. I couldn't pick up the phone. 
Oh, you think it's funny that I slaved all day in this kitchen to make a lovely meal for you? 
It's Carrie, leave me a message. Carrie, it's me. 
It was the longest we'd ever gone without speaking. 
Carrie. 
Hi. - I need to talk to you. - How long have you been waiting here? 
Seventeen-dollars long. 
Please get in. 
It just hit 18. 
- This is weird, not talking. 
- I'm upset. 
You have to forgive me. 
You badger me to forgive you in three days. 
You won't even consider forgiving Steve for something he did six months ago. 
It's not the same thing. It's forgiveness. 
I don't know that I can trust that it won't happen again. 
Miranda, I know I made it hard for you to trust me but you made it hard for me to trust you. 
The way you treated me and cut me out of your life like that. 
How do I know she's not gonna punish me for the rest of my life? 
You don't. 
And she doesn't know for sure that you won't have another indiscretion. 
All you can know is that you wanna move forward and risk that the love you have for each other won't allow that to happen. 
And that's what we'll discover here. 
So we're done with our last session. 
We're not allowed to talk to each other for two weeks while we figure out if being together again is something that we really want. 
And then we had to pick a place to meet and if we both show up on that day, the past no longer exists. 
It's like showing up is our promise to each other that we're both willing to let it all go and move forward. 
Wow. 
- Can you do that? - I don't know. 
I don't know. I have a lot of thinking to do. 
- Thinking? Or feeling? - What do you mean? 
Well, Miranda, you're a lawyer. 
You know, you can argue both sides of any case. 
But why we feel what we feel isn't logical. 
It's emotional. 
So I'm sorry, Harvard, but I'm afraid you're gonna have to base this decision on your emotions. Well, then I'm screwed. 
I don't know what I feel. You will. There will come a moment when you know. 
And if it's" yes," then all that brilliant logic it's gonna go right out the window with the past. 
- On the Brooklyn Bridge. 
- Halfway between our two places. 
- Very logical, and yet poetic. Poetic if we both show up. 
Otherwise you're on a bridge, rejected. 
It's not a good plan. 
- Hey. - Hey. 
I got two pieces of good news. - Oh, and I've got two coffees. 
- Thank you. 
Here you go. So, what's up? 
I just heard from your realtor and the apartment on 5th has finally sold. 
You got 60 days before the new owner takes possession, and you're out of there. 
And what is the other news? 
I'm moving back to St. Louis and we're getting married in the fall. 
Oh, my God. 
Wait a minute, I gotta see that. 
- Well, it's gorgeous. - And you know what? 
On the day of her decision deadline true to form, Miranda had argued both sides of the case. 
Thank you. 
It suddenly dawned on Miranda that Steve's list might have had more cons than pros. 
Well, almost never. 
Kiss me. 
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry. 
I'm your next-door neighbor and my dog ran up on your dick... Deck. 
Suddenly it wasn't so secret what she was missing. 
Wanna join me? 
A woman put a glass on your new desk without a coaster. 
I said," If you do it again, I'm gonna break your arm." 
- Bathroom? 
Good, good, good. Where's Samantha? 
Her plane landed two hours ago. Oh, you know her. 
You have a rat in your purse. - That rat better be housebroken. - Take your coat? 
- Sure. - Hey, cute bag. 
Oh, my gosh, Samantha. 
You have a dog. 
Did you ever think you'd see the day? 
Mother of God, what's with the gut? 
Well, she's eating something out there. - Come on in! 
- Hi! 
We've been waiting for you. 
I eat so I won't cheat. 
What exactly are you eating? 
Everything except Dante's dick. 
Language, please. 
This is a grown-up apartment now. 
I guess I didn't realize how big I was until I saw it on your faces. 
How...? 
How could you not realize it? 
- I've been avoiding mirrors. 
- Well, I'm proud of you for not cheating. 
I don't think there's anything to be proud of. 
I stuff my face to stop myself from doing something that feels natural to me. 
Now, listen, this isn't about the weight. 
You would look gorgeous at any size. 
- But are you happy? 
- Well relationships aren't always about being happy, right? 
I mean, how often do you feel happy in your relationship? I'm pretty sure that's to you. 
- Every day. 
- You feel happy every day? 
Not all day every day, but every day. 
When was the last time you felt happy? 
Six months ago. 
I think that's normal for L.A. 
- What am I gonna do? - What's your gut tell you? 
I know, but Smith stayed with me through chemo. 
And if he can stay with me through that then I should be able to stay in this relationship for him. 
Sweetie, you just compared your relationship to chemo. 
There we were, the three mirrors Samantha couldn't avoid. 
And Samantha? 
That pillow cost $ 300. 
Hi. 
My little monster. 
Hi. 
You're home. - I thought you were staying the week. - We need to talk. 
Oh, man. 
- I knew this was coming. 
- Yeah. This isn't working. I've done my best. 
I've given it five years and 15 pounds. 
Well, what? 
- You don't love me anymore? 
I'm just gonna say the thing you're not supposed to say. I love you but I love me more. 
And I've been in a relationship with myself for 49 years and that's the one I need to work on. 
You're gonna find a wonderful woman who loves being in a relationship. 
What will you find? 
I don't know. 
But that's a risk I'm willing to take. 
- Hey, no. 
Keep it. 
Every time I look down at it I'm gonna think of you. 
Some love stories aren't epic novels. Some are short stories. 
At this time we ask that all passengers fasten their seat belts in preparation for landing. 
I'm gonna need to take that now. Okay. 
Here we go now. 
As someone returned to my life someone left. 
And I put all your unopened mail from your P.O. box in these envelopes. All right. 
And please, please... 
- Okay. 
- It's my masterpiece. 
- What am I gonna do without you? 
- You'll find some other girl but she won't have my style. 
Saint Louise. 
You brought me back to life. 
And you gave me Louise Vuitton. 
We need to stop crying. 
- Your keys. - Oh, thanks. 
Wait, wait, wait. 
Don't forget your love. 
I found my love. 
I'm leaving that with you. 
- See you at my wedding. 
- I'll meet you in St. Louis. 
Bye. 
And a couple of weeks later a slow-moving Charlotte grabbed a quick lunch. 
- Well, when are you due? 
- Next week. 
- You look gorgeous. 
- Oh, thank you. 
Can I get you something to drink? 
Charlotte. 
Charlotte, wait. 
Wait. Charlotte. 
Charlotte, don't run, you're pregnant. 
I'm not gonna cry. 
I'm not gonna waste tears on you. 
I curse the day you were born. 
I think my water just broke. 
Oh, my God. - Taxi! - My car's right there. 
I don't wanna get in your car! Taxi! 
Please, I gotta get you to the hospital, okay? 
Please? - Okay? 
- Lenox Hill. Okay. Start the car. 
Hey. Hi. 
It's my lot in life to be surrounded by beautiful women. 
Come here. 
- She's gorgeous. 
- Say hello to Rose. 
Now we got a Lily and a Rose. 
Well I have to say, you two are very cool customers making the" baby's here" call without all the" I'm in labor" drama. 
My water broke while I was standing in front of a restaurant. 
- Wow, that's very dramatic. 
- Wait, wait, she's not done. 
- It broke while I was talking to Big. - What? 
I ran into him and I got so upset, my water broke. 
He brought her to the hospital, stayed until the baby was born. 
I think he was hoping to see you. 
Well, today is not about him. 
It's about beautiful baby Rose. 
So we know she has Charlotte's hair. 
What else do we know? 
- She's a doll. 
Mazel tov. - Thank you. Bye. 
He asked me to ask you to call him. 
I know, it's none of my business, but I felt bad for the schmuck hanging around the hospital hoping to see you. 
Every time he heard someone in heels walking down the hall, his heart stopped. 
Harry, it's... 
It's so much more complicated than you can imagine. 
I know it is, and you have every right to never call him, but I just... 
I'm a big pile of love today and I feel bad for the guy. 
He said he's been writing you, but you never responded. 
No, he's never written to me. 
He said he wrote because he didn't have your phone number. No, he's never written. Ever. 
Then why would he say he had? 
This is Louise, leave a message. 
Hey... Hey, Louise, it's me. 
And Lord Byron. 
There they were, the love letters of great men, volume one. 
Plus one more written by John James Preston. 
I wanted to call him, but our love Carrie and Big, volumes one, two and three stopped me. 
Hello? 
I didn't hear my phone. We're shopping for my wedding gown. 
That dress makes your boobies look big. 
- Well, I was gonna call you anyway. 
Today is the final day on the 5th Avenue apartment. 
You have till 6 : 00 before they change the locks. 
No, I don't need to go over there. 
Do you not want those never-worn shoes? 
Oh, God, I completely forgot. 
If you don't, you can send them to me and I'll squeeze my feet into them. 
But it's already 5 : 00. Hello? 
They are never-been-worn, $ 400 shoes. 
Actually 525. 
Yeah, okay. All right, thanks. Bye. 
Taxi! 
The light in our prewar apartment looked completely different postwar. 
It wasn't logic, it was love. 
I guess we were afraid it would mean something if we didn't. 
I'm sorry to have done that to you. 
I'm sorry to have done that to you. 
You know the funny part? 
Is there a funny part? 
We were perfectly happy before we decided to live happily ever after. 
Guess the joke's on us. 
It's comfortable. 
Is this what you had in mind when you installed the carpet? 
I'd like to think I was that smooth. 
We better get up before the new owners bust in on us. 
And the way we decided to get married it was all business. 
No romance. 
That's not the way you propose to someone. 
This is. 
Carrie Bradshaw love of my life will you marry me? 
See, this is why there's a diamond. 
You need to do something to close the deal. 
And forsaking all others... 
And in the end, Carrie Bradshaw married John James Preston in a label-less dress. 
Then by the power vested in me by the state of New York I now pronounce you husband and wife. 
Ever thine. Ever mine. 
Ever ours. 
So you're okay that it was just us? 
It was perfect. You and me, like I said. 
Still, it would have been nice if you had the girls here. 
Which is why I called them. 
- Hi, Carrie! - Mazel tov! 
- Ham and eggs. 
Ham and eggs for you, sir. - Yup, that's me. 
" And as I put the wedding gown away, I couldn't help but wonder : 
'Why is it that we're willing to write our own vows but not our own rules?"' 
And that's just a little something I'm working on. 
Thank you. 
Oh, my God. 
Maybe some labels are best left in the closet. 
" Bride,"" groom,"" husband,"" wife,"" married,"" single" we forget to look past the label to the person. 
- This is delicious. 
- Because everyone else started. 
- Well, that one's an oldie but goodie. 
And speaking of an oldie but goodie... 
- Happy birthday. 
To Samantha. 
Fifty and fabulous. 
To us and the next 50. 
To the next 50. 
And there, in the same city where they met as girls four New York women entered the next phase of their lives dressed head to toe in love. 
Previously on Las Vegas, 
- What's his story anyway? 
- A. J Cooper rancher, oil man, corporate raider. 
he was married. We don't know what happened to her. There's no record of a divorce. 
- Yeah, there's no known children. 
There's a four-year gap where he pretty much disappears From all public records. 
- You're all about secrets, aren't you? - I'm not your father. 
Michael told me everything. 
How you watched me grow up, How you followed me from place to place. 
Mike doesn't know anything. 
- That Casey's little brother? 
- Sam, i'm in love with you. - What? - What? 
What, you heard me, Sam. 
I'm in love with you. 
I've always been in love with you. 
And you have a real chance of getting this job. 
I can only think of one person Who knows this place as well as you do. - Who? 
- Mike Cannon. He gave me his resume a few minutes ago. 
- Piper and Mike got married. - oh my god, oh my god. 
- They're married. - do not tell anybody. 
You know, don't you? 
I may have heard something. 
Before this goes any further, just so you know, We are getting it annulled. 
If I were to have a drunken sham of a marriage, I couldn't think of anybody More perfect to have one with. 
And sold for $ 1.5 million to the anonymous bidder. 
Don't forget tonight's final lot, The one-of-a-kind Mixed Grill 
With the starting bid of $ 7 million. 
Hey. 
I just got the final documents in the mail. Mike and I are officially married. 
Guess what my client gave me? If it requires penicillin, don't touch my desk. 
Is that a $ 50, 000 chip? 
$ 50, 000? 
This wouldn't happen to be A cash gift from a client, Sam? 
No, of course it's not. 
That would be against the rules, right? 
- Right. 
- Mr. Rule enforcer. Yeah. whoo, look at the time. 
Yeah, we're definitely going to have to give this one back. 
You're really taking this whole president of operations thing 
Pretty seriously? - Do I take my job seriously? 
- Yes, Delinda. 
Cooper, i'm having an emergency in the restaurant, well kind of. 
The whole staff, they called in sick. 
Okay, i'll be right over. There's just something I've got to straighten out first. 
I feel like maybe you've gone off the deep end. 
Look you're not keeping the chip. 
No, of course I'm not keeping the chip. 
Hi, there. I'm A. J cooper, owner of the Montecito. 
- Howard. 
- Congratulations, Howard, come with me. 
- Hey. Sam, Howard's been looking all over for you. 
He wants to bet the chip on red. 
Red what? 
Oh, Howard is hilarious. That's so funny, red what? 
- It's your money, so bet away. 
Hey, anything can happen. 
- I didn't know you had a new client, Sam. 
- Yeah, well i do. 
Hey, Howard, Howard, she's the best. 
You're gonna love her. 
As a matter of fact, she's gonna make you the center of her universe, and by center, i mean center. 
Because she's dedicated like that. 
Isn't that right, Sam? 
- Absolutely right. 
- But I'm only here for an hour. 
Best hour of your life. 
- Can I get a what - What? 
- What? 
- Perfect. - let me... 
Let me just hold that for you. 
- i'll keep it. 
All right, Howard, what would you like to do For the next hour? 
Iit is not 10 : 00. 
Can I help you ladies with anything? 
We kinda all forgot our watches. Do you have the time? 
Yes a just of 10.00. 
Everything okay? 
And with over 5, 000 surveillance cameras in the Montecito, 
I guarantee all-access to the stamp display room Is being covered. 
Mr. Limnick's stamp has been appraised at over $ 7 million. 
You're the only person in charge of security? 
We have the tightest security in Vegas. 
The stamp will be safe Until the auction begins in... 56 minutes. 
With the Montecito getting 10 % of the selling price, - It better be. 
- Elliot, Stanley. 
lawyers, They're only interested in the bottom line. 
And they don't share my passion for philately. 
Well it's an acquired taste. I had a stamp collection in my prepubescent years. 
Not that grown men don't love stamps too. like me. love' em. 
Well then you can appreciate how exciting it is To have the only existing 1867 mixed grill going on the market for the first time. 
With its crisp plumed borders, rich cerulean color, 
Ample margins despite being expertly re-perforated. 
And of course the tell-tale combination Of the f and z grillwork on the back 
That make it one-of-a-kind. 
I can feel the electricity in the air. 
Okay, i know you want to watch the auction here, So we'll make sure we have a direct feed Set up for you in the conference room. 
- Thank you, mr. Cannon. 
- No problem. Mike, check this out. 
Looks like some kind of sorority initiation. 
But Danny's on it. 
We got streakers. 
- This is gonna be a fabulous shift. 
- Fabulous. - Something's not right. 
- No. No, Mike. it's very, very right. 
Okay, what could be wrong with women streaking around the place? 
No, no, they're running a pattern. 
I love the pattern. - I need the pattern. 
- They're running for the cameras. 
- Oh, who cares why they're running? 
- They're running. Look at it. behold. 
I'm sorry, mr. Limnick. I gotta take care of something. 
Mitch here will escort you to another area. 
- You OK, you got this? 
Follow me. 
Somebody's getting some exercise. 
You gotta love this place. 
- Ha! Hey you guys ready yet? 
- What the hell? 
- Don't move. hands up. 
Hang up the phone. 
I said hands up. 
This'll be over in 52 minutes. 
Subs by DeSto 
Just take it easy And nobody gets hurt. 
No heroes, no casualties. 
You understand? 
So here's how I see things. You and I can hang out for the next hour, 
Have a few drinks, i can laugh at all your jokes And, you could give me my chip back. - I don't drink. 
- You don't drink. 
- See I'm already laughing at your jokes. 
- And I don't gamble. 
Touching money makes me uncomfortable 
And crowds make me nervous. 
Okay, listen, we just need to hang out together, So that it appears as though I'm doing my job. 
So maybe we could see a show? 
- Hello, claustrophobic. - Claustrophobic. 
- Pool lounge. 
- Germs. 
Germs. look, mr... uh... 
- Post, Howard Post. - Post, yes. Howard Post. 
I just need you to be satisfied, So maybe you could just tell me what you need. 
And I can make it happen. well... 
- I am a little hungry. 
- That's great. good for you. 
- How long are we supposed to wait? 
It's the worst service I've ever had. 
Service? I haven't seen anyone serving anything. 
I'm sorry, gentlemen, We're a little understaffed this evening. 
If you could just please bear with us, that would be great. 
I've never had so many people out sick at the same time. 
- And it's friday night rush. 
- I'd suggest we move these people To tables in our other restaurants right away. 
let's do it. 
Sorry, ladies, but this isn't 1978. 
Streaking is against the law. 
So, you have to lock us up? 
Yeah just until we know for sure that nobody wants to sue you. 
He said we weren't gonna get in trouble. 
What do you mean" he"? 
The guy who hired us. 
And streak until we got caught. 
He didn't say anything about us being locked up. 
This guy mention anything 
About why he wanted you to run naked across the casino? 
He paid us each five grand in cash. why ask why? 
Guys, reunite the ladies With their clothes in holding, please. 
- Something's up. 
- Yeah. 
- Hey, Mitch. 
- Hey, Danny. 
Run a video i. q. on these girls. Find out who they were talking earlier. 
They said that somebody paid' em. We just need to find out who. - You got it. 
- How does everything else look from up there? 
Sure, Danny, - Nothin'but aces. 
- Great. 
Come on, come on. 
Are you sure that's what he said? 
Nothing but aces means a hostage situation. 
Mitch is the one that called it in. 
So it's got to be going on in surveillance. - The stamp guys. 
- I thought you said you checked them out. 
Background. Metal detector, hand search, pat down. 
There's only three of' em. 
Plus the streakers. 
Paid anonymously in cash, so... 
So we get an i. q. on the girls, maybe they... 
No, no, we can't do that. 
Everything we need is in surveillance, And everything we do, they're gonna see. 
Okay, the only places we don't have cameras Are in the men's rooms, the women's rooms, 
- The hotel rooms, my office, and Cooper's. 
- What? A couple of guys can't whisper in the men's room? 
Okay, i need you to get teams to cover the cages, The counting rooms, the vaults, and the stamp box. 
Since we don't know what they're looking at, we gotta cover' em all. 
Off the radio. Whoever they are, they may be listening in. 
Okay, okay, you do that. And I'm gonna try to figure out some way To get into surveillance off-camera. 
What about the police? 
No, n-no, they're gonna see metro Before they even get out of the valet. 
Okay, until we know the threat to our people, We gotta keep this business as usual. 
Keep it between us. don't tell anybody. 
You focus on surveillance, I'll focus on the floor. 
stay visible. 
If head of security's acting normal, whoever's doing this 
Isn't gonna know that we're onto him. all right? 
I can't go to any restaurant, mr. 
Cooper. This dinner was supposed to impress my clients. 
Well, i think they'd be impressed with a private dinner In the v. i. p. room of our top clu 
It's waiting for you. 
And what can we do about your anniversary, mr. Flannigan? 
50th anniversary. 
Wow, that's a big one. 
How about a candlelight dinner in the honeymoon suite? 
I'll have you and your wife moved there For the rest of your stay. 
You can do that? 
I own the place. I can do anything. 
Tracy here will take care of you. Tracy? - Sure. 
- Thank you. - Thank you. 
- We did it? - We did. Everyone's happy. 
But I'm starving. 
How'bout dinner? 
- I'll do the cooking. really? 
- You can cook? 
Only one thing, but I do it well. 
I need plain clothes security to cover the cages, Vaults, counting room, and the auction now. 
Hey, babe, just checking in, Seeing where you are. 
- I'm just having dinner with... 
- Okay, just go ahead and keep doing that. 
- Uh, no rush, no rush. i love you. 
- love you too. 
- It's Danny. 
I figured. 
So the key to a perfect steak Is to use coarse sea salt, 
And then grill it for 3 1 / 2 minutes on each side. 
Exactly 3 1 / 2 minutes. 
So are you getting excited? 
It's only a month or so left. 
Yeah, excited, absolutely. of course. 
It's okay to be scared too. 
You can be both. 
I'm a little worried. 
Okay, maybe more than a little. 
I mean, what if, what if I'm not a good mother? 
What if I do something to hurt the baby? What if I do something wrong? 
Well your mother did a good job with you. 
I think it's gonna run in the family. 
- You think so? 
- Yeah, i do. 
I hope you're right. 
- So where are you from? 
- Boy or a girl? 
- We don't want to know. 
- You got a feeling? 
What? 
How come you're always the one asking questions? 
Maybe you should try answering some instead. 
- Hey, i'm an open book. 
This mysterious owner thing is just everyone's imagination. 
Okay, maybe I don't ooze information. But I'm approachable. 
Everyone thinks you're standoffish, There fore unapproachable. Okay. 
Ask me something you really want to know. 
Then I'll ask you something. 
Sounds fair. 
Buzz me in, Mitch. 
Now is not a good time, Piper. 
I need to leave these papers for Mike. 
Mike's not here. 
Can I just put them on his desk? 
Hello, Mitch! 
Mitch? can you hear me? 
Loud and clear. 
This is a joke, right? 
this blouse is new and dry-clean only, so watch it. 
Watch the hair. 
Is he dead? 
Oh, my god. 
Mitch, what's going on? 
This looks like we've got the head of security's wife. 
Yeah, and he's gonna kick both of your asses When he finds out you even looked at me... 
I think he's thinking about someone else's ass right now. 
He can do what he wants with who he wants. 
Even if she is a fat whore. 
Caliente. 
No moves on the counting room, cages, or vault. 
Anything on your end? 
I got nothing. They cut my cameras to surveillance So I'm totally in the dark here. 
And I'm looking at these schematics. And it doesn't look like there's any approach. They can't get a visual on. 
I think we outdid ourselves when we built this place, Mikey. 
It's irony, my friend. 
These guys are using our knowledge against us. 
Yeah, well, no security system is 100 % impenetrable. 
So we just gotta fig... 
- Okay, i gotta call you back. 
- Okay. 
All right, Howard, we have caviar, king crab legs, - Maine lobster claws... 
- No. 
No, okay, forget the sea food. 
We have kobe beef, wagyu short ribs, duck 
- No. - Quail, no? 
no. no quail? 
Howard, you do realize that people wait Their whole entire lives to eat these things, right? 
You did say you were hungry? 
I am, but I couldn't possibly enjoy it in only 31 minutes. 
I chew very thoroughly. - Okay. 
- Choking hazard. 
Howard, i got it, listen to me. 
I need you to help me out with this, okay? Because I am at a loss. 
And I am, in fact, never at a loss. 
There are so many things I've been wanting to ask you. 
Like, who are you married to? 
You never really talk about her. 
I mean, do you have a girlfriend now? 
Why did you really buy the Montecito? Oh god, what else? 
What do you sleep in? 
Okay, maybe that's a little too personal. 
Do you sleep with a gun under your pillow? 
That's a lot of questions. I don't know where to start. 
A gun under my pillow? That would be silly. 
I keep mine on the nightstand. 
You don't gamble, you don't drink... 
What exactly is it that you expect to get from Vegas? 
The thrill of my life. 
The thrill of your life. 
You're a pervert. I should have gotten that. 
I'm so off my game right now. 
Oh, you have exactly 31 minutes 
To get the thrill of your life... 
And that should be plenty of time for you. 
- And then? 
- You get your chip back. 
That is correct. 
What do you do for fun? You know, when you're not working? 
Work can be fun, if you do it right. 
What about this wife? 
You never mention her. 
See, you've got to get the grill hot. 
That's the mistake that people make. 
They put the meat on when it's warm, and then they heat it up, 
But you can't sear it in the juices that way. It makes for a dry steak. 
She was my wife, and now she's not. 
Putting a family together's difficult enough. 
Having one fall apart's a whole'nother kind of hard. 
You're obviously criminals, And we're obviously here for a while, 
So maybe you can explain to me The benefit of getting into surveillance. 
Honey, i'm not giving any information up to you. 
But maybe later you can give something up to me. Ha! 
yeah, like maybe in your dreams. 
No, but seriously, i mean, what are you guys thinking? 
Nothing happens up here. 
Everything worth having is not in this room. 
Hey, can i please get a cushion for under my ass? - Please? 
- Does she ever shut up? - No. 
- She is chatty. 
Thank you. 
Looks like the cavalry isn't coming up here anytime soon. 
Switch over to the display room In the adjacent back-Of-House hallways. 
It's almost time for the auction. 
I get your master plan, now. 
It's pure genius in its simplicity. 
Genius. What did i expect from you master criminals? 
You're trying to bore us to death. 
Well it's working by the way. 
Can we stab her with a needle too? 
- I have a spare. 
All right, howard is the guy you're gonna be taking care of. 
You have until 11 : 00 to give him what he wants. Stay away from the buffet, please, girls. 
Do you have any idea how many diseases those women carry? 
You said you wanted the thrill of your life. 
- I was referring to stamps. 
- Stamps? 
I came to see the mixed grill. 
- Which is a stamp? - Yes. 
I'm sorry, let me just make sure i have this right. 
So i spent $ 10, 000 on food and entertainment, 
And you would like to see a stamp? 
Why didn't you just tell me that? 
I thought it was clear. 
- Do i look like a mind reader to you? 
- Well... no. 
3 1 / 2 minutes. 
- So what does the a.J. Stand for? 
- Nothing. 
My grandfather was just r.J. My dad was just k.J. 
Why couldn't it stand for nothing? 
Well i was kind of hoping it stood for andrew jackson, cause that's what i put down in the betting pool. 
- They're betting on my name? - Oh, yeah, sure. 
The staff pretty much bets on everything around here. 
Too much time on their hands. 
Those smell amazing. - How much longer? 
- Getting there. 
Please let something happen soon, or else i'm gonna die. 
What, what? 
What the hell is this? 
Let's drop him in 
- What, what? 
- Easy, easy. 
What? I was just trying to find my wedding ring. 
- In an air duct above the surveillance room? - Yeah. Sit down. 
Okay, my wife was at the spa. 
And i met a young lady at the bella petto where i only went 
Because i heard they had the best buffalo wings in town. 
But she came on to me. I mean, i'm not the kind of guy that does this sort of thing, 
Except for that one time in branson. And one other time in reno. 
Hey, hey, the duct, the duct. 
Right, so i took the young lady up to my room, just for, you know, one little drink. 
And i decided to take my wedding ring off, in case she was some kind of a crook or something. 
I didn't know that she was going to take her clothes off. 
Anyway, the lamp that i hid my ring under fell over 
And knocked the ring into the vents, so i went down into the vent to look for it, 
And i got lost somehow. 
It's not like i did anything illegal here, okay. 
This is vegas, and what happens in vegas stays in vegas, right? 
- He's alone. 
- Of course i'm alone. 
I didn't want to make a big deal out of this because i didn't want my wife To find out. 
You think we don't know who you are, mr. 
Mccoy? Okay, okay, you got me. 
When you killed the feed to my office, I got an automatic signal, okay, 
So i guess i decided to go commando. 
Everybody knows that i got to where i am because i was bangin' the boss's daughter. 
So i thought that i would, you know, try to pull this one off, This one thing off, alone, 
So that everybody would stop thinking i'm some kind of a jerk - Who got handed the big chair, okay? 
- Doesn't matter either way. If anyone were on to us, cannon would be doing more 
Brainpower around here couldn't spark a match. 
- Okay, okay. 
- Sit down. 
Okay, okay, please just don't shoot me. 
Don't shoot me, please, please don't shoot. 
Get off me and sit. 
God, longest hour of my life. 
Some marine you are. 
This is delicious. 
Oh, foolproof recipe. 
So i guess it's your turn. 
- You love danny? 
- More than anything. 
He's the whole package. 
Don't tell anybody, but he's very thoughtful and sensitive. 
He cries watching old yeller. 
I'm kind of used to the idea of getting married And then having a baby. 
I guess things are a little different now. 
I guess they are. 
A glass of cabernet would go great with this. 
Well you're in your third trimester. You know, some doctors say it's okay to have a little. 
Some even say it helps ward off contractions. 
You know a lot about pregnancy and babies to not have children yourself. 
That's not a question. That's a statement. 
You need me to ask? 
I'm not sure you'd want to hear the answer, delinda. 
Going once, going twice, sold for $ 2.2 million. 
Up next at 11 : 00, the 1867 mixed grill 
On display in exhibit hall c. 
Come on, danny, give me something. 
You don't have a plan, do you? 
Oh you just dropped through the ceiling, and you've got nothing? 
He has a plan? 
First i find out that my boss has been following me around for 20 years, 
And then i wake up married, and now i'm being held hostage. 
This place is crazy. 
Hey, let's go out to dinner sometime. 
- Are you serious? - I'm married. 
- No. 
- He has a plan. 
Wow, it's like a cocktail party in hell. 
I take it you're not a stamp aficionado. 
Uh, no, but please, go crazy. 
Most people don't realize that every stamp has its own personality. 
The 1957 general john j. Pershing 
$ 0.08 standard post, for example, 
Is like a stern, disapproving father. 
Authoritative, yet withholding. 
I think i dated that stamp. 
The quinta de goya airmail from spain 
Is like an exotic lover... 
Tempting you to touch, yet always just Beyond your grasp. 
Secretive, seductive, rousing. 
- Oh, i definitely divorced that stamp. 
- And i have them all. 
- Oh, that's great. 
- Except... 
The holy grail. 
I think i'm getting chills. 
Say it. 
This is danny mccoy. All security personnel proceed to the vault. 
There's a theft in progress. Repeat, 
- Proceed to the vault. - Got it. Let's go. 
Hang on, i want to take a little detour. 
Beautiful, isn't it? 
I mean, you can't even send a letter with this stamp, right? No. 
The last of security is out of the display room. We're clear to move. Go. 
We are clear to exit. 
South service doors to east hallway. Turn left to exit. 
We good? 
Just in time. 
Hey, hey, guys. 
- Security system is down. - Thank you all. 
You've been lovely company. Except for you. 
Security system is down. 
I gotta pee. 
- Piper, give me your earring. 
- For what? 
- So i can wear it. 
Just give it to me. 
- Oh, sarcasm is not what i need right now. 
What i need right now is a bathroom. - Piper, give me the earring. 
- Now you're mr. Tough guy? Give me the earring, give me the earring. 
Here, put it here. 
Get the back-Up system online. We need to reboot the cameras 
- To get' em back up. 
- No we don't have time for that. 
Macgyver, full bladder over here. 
Ready to explode. 
I need you to go over there and cut those guys loose, and check on that guy. 
He's gonna need a doctor. All right? 
There, take this. What? 
Oh, my god. Did you hit him on the tracking device when you grabbed him? 
'Cause they're headed for the east loading dock. All right, call metro. 
I'm gonna call mike. 
Piper, i need your cell phone. - Yeah, yeah, take it, take it. 
- Get a doctor up here. 
Hey, how are you? 
How you doing? 
Two armed groups, four men who committed the robbery, and two others who took over surveillance. 
- Piper, i'm kinda busy right... 
- No, it's danny. - Danny, we got three of' em. 
- What about the stamp? 
- We got that too. 
You okay? 
- Yeah, lovely, 
Lovely, meet me at the east loading dock. 
Go, go, go, what the hell... 
Hey, have you seen that little weirdo i gave the $ 50, 000 chip to? 
I was just held hostage for almost an hour. 
They took over surveillance at gunpoint. They drugged people, they tied us up, it was crazy. 
- So you haven't seen him? 
- No. 
- We should do this again sometime. 
- We should. 
I feel like i know you a little better. 
You know, any time you wanna hang out, let me know. 
What happens in the restaurant stays in the restaurant. Yes 
Yes, danny. 
Where are you? 
Mr. Limnick, you okay? 
- You need anything? 
- No, no, i'm fine. 
Thank you, the house doctor already looked me over. 
I don't need to go to the hospital. - I just would like to lay down in my room. 
- If there's anything you need... 
I appreciate that. 
I'm just so embarrassed to have put you through all this. 
I worked with elliot for years... 
Well, listen, you're definitely not the first person that's been a victim of an inside job, 
And metro just said that there may have been a third party involved, so... 
But the good news is that you got your stamp back. Yeah. 
Maybe it's a sign, huh? 
I probably would have regretted giving this up. 
Excuse me. 
You know that i would have told you about this earlier, but... 
Hey, that's why i hired you guys... to make those decisions. 
- Anyway, they were stupid. 
- What do you mean? 
Well, a $ 7 million stamp seems like small change 
When there's $ 30 million cash on hand, 
And they could just walk right in and take it. 
Think about it. 
Yeah, i would have gone for the cash. 
Well, you've obviously never had a stamp collection as a kid. 
- Have you seen howard post? 
- Howard post? 
Yeah, i was with him before the smoke bombs. 
It's probably more money than that man's ever seen in his whole life. 
Sam, howard post is worth nearly $ 3 billion. - What? 
- He's an inventor. Multiple patents. He's a reclusive tycoon. 
So he's worth more than anything in the casino. 
So now he is worthy run after whom 
I can't believe i've never heard of this guy. 
He likes it that way. 
He lives in some compound on the east coast and almost never leaves. 
- Hey, do we have a back-Up i.Q. On him? - Yeah. 
Why aren't they moving? 
Fast forward this. 
All right, hold it. 
Wait, he's got a jet at mccarran. 
His pilot just logged in a flight plan to rio. It leaves in 20 minutes. 
Looks like he's gonna cut and run. 
Yeah, and leave elliot and stanley to take the fall. 
All right, mitch, call the control tower. - Have them hold that jet. - Yep. 
This is absurd. 
You have no legitimate reason to delay this flight any longer than you already have. 
Now if you don't clear me for take off in five minutes, i am going whether you like it or not. 
I'll see what i can do. 
- Do we wait for metro? 
- No, no time. 
Mr. Limnick! 
So glad i caught you. 
We heard you left the hotel, and i wanted to warn you, - Your stamp might still be in danger. 
- What kind of danger? 
Well, we got confirmation that one of the thieves is still at large and he's armed, 
And i just wanted to suggest that you consider traveling with security. 
That won't be necessary. I appreciate the montecito's concern, - But we're just about to take off. 
- Are you sure? 
- Positive. Thank you, though. 
- Great. Have a safe flight. 
And next time you're in vegas... whoa. 
Whoa, whoa, what is that? 
- What is what? 
- That! 
That is not good. 
Oh, no, no, no. The servo-Lock on this thrust reverser is jammed. 
Mr. Cannon, i can assure you that my pilot does a thorough check before we take off. 
Missed this one. 
You take off like that, you are guaranteed to drop 
Like a bikini top at bella petto. 
That's our european-Style pool, you know. Topless. 
Hey, can i get somebody to come over here and look at this reverser? 
Mr. Post, all right. 
I'm doing the best that i can here, okay? 
- Watch out. 
The guy behind me? 
- Yes. 
Guess i was wrong about that reverser. 
Your mistake has made me late, mr. 
Cannon. Next time, i suggest you leave it to the professionals. 
You're right. 
I'm a security guy. That's more my speed. 
I'll take that. 
And everyone wonders why i never leave the house. 
- Hey, howard. Howard, hey. 
- Hi. Oh, i was so worried about you. 
- Really? - Yeah. 
Are you okay? - Well, a little... 
I think you have something of mine, so... 
Oh there it is. 
Oh, for god's sake. 
- Why'd he do that? 
So howard's in good hands, 
And the mainframe should be back up and running in a few hours. 
And barry and his guys are in custody, and his stamp's on the way to the museum, so i guess that's that. 
Ah, just doing my job. 
No, it's not that. 
Old yeller. 
I had a yellow lab as a boy. 
Careful, you don't want to lose that. 
Oh, no, no, no, that's not mine. 
Apparently it's not mine either. 
- That's very good. 
Casino rules. 
- Yeah, your rules. 
Yes, i'm president now. 
I have to start thinking about stuff like that, 
Not just what's best for me and my friends, But what's--You know, what's best for the whole montecito. 
Thank you. My heart bleeds for you. 
Sam, sam, sam. 
I'd appreciate it if you didn't do the" sam, sam, sam" thing, Cause the only person who got anything out of this deal 
Is this hotel and maybe a few independent contractors who, By the way, i was reluctant to work with in the first place, 
And i really don't want to hear about your rules, danny Because your rules suck. Wow. 
Howard's gonna be sad to hear that. 
What, are you friends with howard now? 
I wouldn't say that, but to know that after he talked to the police, 
- He came back here to say thanks. - He did? 
Yeah, yeah, as a matter of fact, last time i saw him, 
He was on the casino floor looking for you. 
We have a private blackjack table just for you, Disinfected cards, disinfected chair. 
Yes, uh, eh... 
Oh the dealer is extremely tidy. 
Are you feeling worried about touching the money? Well, you shouldn't, because we have brand-New chips for you. 
- I don't know. 
- I think you do know. 
I think you should give it a try. 
Oh, look. Apparently the first bet's on me. 
It was horrible. 
I mean, it just went on and on. I was just praying for someone to make it stop. 
Being held hostage is terrifying. Believe me, i know. 
No, no. I was just in the elevator with our new stand-Up comic. The guy blows. 
Got our copies. We're official. 
Well, welcome to the family, mrs. 
Cannon. 
I mean, i totally freaked out when i heard. 
That's why we didn't tell you. We want you to freak out. 
Still, i mean, i wish i could have done something instead of being totally oblivious, Having dinner with cooper. 
What? 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You had dinner with cooper? 
- Did you find anything out? - Do you know what his initials stand for? 
What happened to his wife? 
I didn't find out anything. 
I mean, you know how standoffish he is. 
Oh... does... come on, he must have told you something. 
- Come on, delinda! - Don't hold out on us! 
We don't care anyway! 
* people wait too long before they tell the one * * and that's a shame, baby - Should we tell our folks? 
- Think we should? 
I really like this. 
* you, right here, right now, yeah * * ooh, right here, right now * 
* ooh, right here * * goin' to the chapel * and we're gonna get married * * goin' to the chapel * and we're gonna get married * * gee, i really love you 
26th floor, folks. Have a lucky day. Hi. 
Good morning, mrs. Cannon. Line two. 
It's your mother. 
Mom... 
It's too small, and all we have to do is 
Pull out these two banks of slots, And then we can double the blackjack tables, 
Put in two roulette wheels, a craps set-Up, a private bar. 
- How much? - $ 1.6 million. 
- How long? - Five weeks. 
$ 1.6 million, not counting loss of revenue In slot machines and disruption to the casino. 
Sure. You'll make up that difference in three months. 
- Patience, sam. 
- That's it? - That's it. 
- Another cryptic response? 
I mean, isn't this whole, uh, mysterious thing getting a little old for you? 
I have plans for the montecito, and you may figure prominently in those plan 
I would actually rather just hear" no" Than to have to parse your statements like they're diplomatic cables. 
Okay, there will be no new high-Roller area in this casino. 
So what happends to anything can happen 
Anything can happen. It just did. 
Who told you we're married? 
You think your mama doesn't have Her own surveillance and security? 
Well, you got it half-Right. 
We are getting married. 
When were you gonna tell me? 
- Uh, it's been sort of a whirlwind. 
- She isn't pregnant, is she? - Did you get the girl pregnant? 
- Mom, no, of course not. 
Well, who is she? 
I'm sure she's beautiful. 
Where is she from? 
I was gonna call you. 
I have rooms for you and the whole family Here at the montecito. 
I was just waiting to get plane reservations. 
- When is the wedding? 
- This weekend. 
My baby's getting married! Ha ha ha! 
Did some guy just win six figures or something? 
Nope. 
Seven? Cooper said no to your high-Roller area, didn't he? 
- Yeah, he blew my ass right out of the water. 
- I'm so sorry. Thanks. 
When it rains, it pours. 
Who's that? 
- Isn't that casey manning's brother? - Vic? Yeah. 
He looks different. 
Didn't they used to... oh, yeah. 
Itch, itch. 
I'm not sleeping with you. I'm in a bad mood. 
You look beautiful, and i think you're actually happy to see me. Hi. Hi. 
- Hi - Hi 
It is nice to see you. 
You look good. 
- What happened to you? 
- A little bit of therapy. A lot of humiliation. 
What's with the suit? 
Oh, i got $ 1 billion, and that's with a" b." 
Casey left me everything. 
That son of a bitch. 
I thought he died broke. 
What are you doing here? 
First, i came to see you. 
Then i'm gonna take montecito back. 
If i tell my mother i got married without her, i'm a dead man. 
- So what are you gonna do? 
- I told her the wedding's this weekend. 
- You're throwing a fake wedding? - Yeah. - Oh, my god, that's genius! 
- Will you fix that up for me? 
I'd be falsely honored. 
- So you know what this means. 
- Yeah, i have 24 hours 
To pull off what normally takes a gaggle of giggling women six months. 
Come on, mike, we do that kind of stuff all the time. Last-Minute weddings are easy. 
What this means is that your best friend in the world gets to throw you a bachelor party, A kick-Ass bachelor party. 
I never even thought of that. 
Your priorities are all messed up, man. That's the best part. 
Where are you going? 
Well, i gotta tell piper. 
- She doesn't know yet? 
- She's gonna flip from happiness. We're having a wedding, danny mccoy. 
- Mmm, hi, husband. 
- Hey, wifey, what would you say to a wedding? 
- I'd say we already had one. 
- No, no, no, i mean a real wedding, 
With flowers, and food, and bouquet-Throwing, and drunk friends, and crazy family. 
- When? 
- Are you free saturday? - You're kidding. 
- Well, i've already told my folks, 
And my aunts and my uncles, and they'll be here tomorrow. 
Ow! 
What was that for? How am i supposed to get a wedding dress in a day? 
- I thought - You thought? How about my mother and my college friends 
And what about the food, and the flowers, and the bridesmaids? I mean, they've got to get dresses too, you know. 
And don't you think people are gonna wonder why we didn't tell them, what, oh, i don't know, three months ago? 
My mother found out we were already married, but i said" no, we're getting married." 
Quick thinking, right? So now we have to have it... ow! 
I thought we weren't supposed to tell anybody outside of this hotel. 
You do not want to get on my mama's bad side, trust me. 
And if there's any place we can pull this off, it's here at the montecito. 
I've already cashed in a cd, so this whole thing is covered, piper. Come on. 
- Well, i did always want a big wedding. 
- Yes! Me too. 
Maybe we can tell people that we had a whirlwind courtship, And we couldn't wait... because i got pregnant. 
That... you're not, are you? 
- I better not be. 
- And i get to throw the bachelorette. 
- That would only be fair. 
What was the name of that male dancer everybody's hiring? 
Oh, yeah, the tripod. 
That's just sick. 
Like you're not gonna have strippers. 
I'm here to negotiate the ground rules, okay? 
I'm listening, mr. Mccoy. 
First, accommodations. 
The 35th floor is closed off till next monday so noise won't be a problem. 
I'd suggest we each take a suite on different ends of the floor - Deal. 
- Entertainment. 
I suggest a military option. 
Don't ask, don't tell? I can live with that. 
- Just nothing disgusting, okay? 
- Define disgusting. 
Nothing either of us has to lie about. 
Like this whole fake wedding thing? 
Isn't it crazy? 
We live together, we're having a baby, and they're the ones getting married. 
- Yeah, it's crazy. - It's crazy. 
You know vic manning? 
Uh, casey manning's younger brother. 
He's right here in the hotel 
What's your impression of him? 
He's the gm at the montecito property in hawaii. 
He wears flowery shirts. 
He has got a big old puppy dog crush on sam, - But he's a nice kid. 
- Well, he's not a kid anymore. He's 27. 
He quit his job in hawaii six months ago, and he's wearing a suit 
Well, i guess when your older brother's a billionaire, it's easy to look ineffectual. 
Yeah., i got a call from my lawyers in new york. He wants a meeting. 
Maybe he's looking for a job. 
- What about the wedding? 
- Just, uh, just putting it together. 
You know, we could use the pictures in a brochure or something, - Write it off to marketing. 
- Really? 
That's very generous of you. 
You throwing a stag for mike? 
Yeah, yeah, we're putting a little something together. 
You want in? 
- Hey, i wouldn't miss it. - Okay. Thanks. 
- I'll bring the cigars. - Okay. 
- What's this cooper like? 
- He's an idiot. 
- I'm not used to getting shot down like that. 
- Believe me, i know. 
I can't believe i used to own this place, and now i have to beg for scraps. 
- You ever watch deadwood? - Hmm? 
In the old west, a man was obligated to marry his brother's widow 
And get back what was rightfully his. 
Deadwood's cancelled. What's your point? 
- This stays between us, okay? 
- Wow. I have a will that instructs casey's estate to pay the back taxes on the montecito, 
- Then leaves the rest to me. 
- That's not what happened. 
Which is why my lawyers tell me that the tax sale went forward illegally. 
This will supercedes everything. 
You know you annoy the hell out of me, right? 
Look how comfortable this is. I know everything about you. You know everything about me. 
" In the event of my death, all taxes, the montecito hotel and casino..." 
I didn't just come here to get my brother's hotel back. 
You know that i've always been in love with you. 
Cooper's gonna lose the montecito. 
Things are already in motion. 
- Can you believe we're doing this? - What? 
Planning two bachelor parties and a wedding in one night. 
I don't think it's that crazy. 
Not any crazier than us getting back together and having a baby. 
You know, i was just thinking, when he or she is born, 
We shouldn't have to explain anything to anybody. 
Our baby should have a name. That name should be mccoy. 
Well, we are already planning the damn thing. You know, what difference is it gonna make if we add one more couple to it? 
- Oh, my god, i never thought it would happen like this. - Like what? 
Like me seven months pregnant for one thing. 
So it's not from a storybook. 
- But we can write our own story. - Come on, danny. 
* i'm watching you breathing for the last time * * a song for your heart * but when it is quiet 
Will you marry me? 
- Is everything okay with the baby? 
- Oh, the baby's fine. 
- You're sure? 
- Yeah. 
Listen, mom, 
- Danny and i are getting married. 
- Married? 
Saturday. 
- I thought you'd be thrilled. 
- I am, i guess. 
I know we should have told you, but... 
A double wedding sounds interesting. 
I don't know why you're not over the moon about your best friend wanting to share This very special day with you, mike. 
Besides, your wedding's fake anyway. 
At least i got married before my girl got pregnant. 
- Drunk off your ass. - Yeah, okay, i guess i'm just stressed out 
Over getting everything set for my family. 
It'd be an honor to have you and delinda get married with us. 
- Really? - Yeah. 
I never thought i'd say this, but i'm actually excited about getting married. - Yeah? 
- Yeah. Wow, you are such a girl. 
I know. Come here. Give me a hug. 
Bachelor party tonight. Be ready. 
- You be ready. - I will. 
Listen, i gotta run. My family will be here in a few. 
- Really? Where? 
- In the lobby. 
- I'll be there. 
- Okay. - I'll be there. 
- Victor manning. 
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. 
Now that is a great saddle. 
It was a gift from my ranch manager. 
That's a hell of a gift. 
You must be a good boss. 
Well, my tendency is to dabble in more than one business, so it's meant 
T to remind me to ride one horse at a time. Sit down. 
Which leads me nicely to the reason i'm here. 
When casey died so suddenly, it threw our family's financial affairs into turmoil. 
- I certainly understand. I'm sorry for your loss. - Thank you. 
As my brother's principal heir, i found that there were some... irregularities In the disposition of his affairs. 
I didn't figure you were here because we had a great buffet. 
The montecito never should have been sold. 
I bought it in a tax sale conducted by the irs. 
If you have a problem, it's with the united states government. 
I want it back. And... 
i am prepared to make you an all-Cash offer... 
Your $ 241 million investment 
- Plus 50 %. 
- You're writing a check for $ 360 million? 
Kind of hard to fit all those zeroes in the little line here. 
It's a $ 120 million profit for four months' work. 
- The montecito is not for sale. 
- 60 %. 
You have my answer. 
I'm probably gonna have to fight you on this. 
Do what you gotta do. - Aloha, mr. 
Cooper. - It's just cooper. 
Aloha. 
I don't want to stand there in front of everybody and god 
Next to this big, fat, pregnant chick wearing a circus tent for a wedding dress 
We'll take separate pictures. 
- This was your idea, wasn't it? 
- No, But what was i gonna say? He's my best friend. 
How am i gonna explain this to my mother? 
- Your mom's coming? - Yeah. 
- That's great. - I guess. 
At least we don't have to pay for any of it. Cooper is picking up the tab. 
- What? 
- Cha-Ching. 
Yes. No, if he pays, that's just one more chance for him to interfere in my life. 
You know, give me a legitimate wedding And this whole thing is tied up in a nice bow. 
Let's not do anything hasty. 
If you ever want to have sex with your wife again, you will go up there right now 
And you will tell him that you cashed in that cd. 
Go. 
My folks will be here any minute, So i really need to be in the lobby area. 
Fine, i'll do it. 
You were just kidding about that sex thing, right, baby? 
His attorneys claim to have another will that supercedes the one the irs used to initiate the tax sale. 
- Have you seen it? 
- Not yet. We will in discovery, of course. 
- What are his chances? 
If the new will's legitimate, he's got a shot. 
If you don't mind my asking, what was vic manning's offer? 
He went as high as $ 385 million. 
- You should consider it. 
- Why? 
Because it's a hell of a profit for four months' work. 
And because you've already shown that you can run this place when nobody thought that you could. 
You're gonna have investors lined up around the block. 
You're saying i should build another hotel? 
I understand the parcel next to the montecito is for sale. 
I don't do well with partners. 
Then borrow against the $ 140 million profit and do it yourself. 
- Let him sue. 
- It's a risk. 
If i could get manning's lawyers to sweeten the offer, why not sell? 
Because i like it here, 
Thank you, cathy. 
- I thought you were through interfering in my life. 
- I am. - So why are you paying for my wedding? - I'm not. 
I'm paying for mike's wedding. Oh. 
- Is your mom coming? 
- Ah, so she says. 
She's pretty unreliable, though, so i'm not gonna get my hopes up. 
- She know about you and my dad? - No. 
And i'd like to keep it that way. 
- Cooper. - Yes? Well, i mean, you know, since you're paying for this whole thing and 
I was wondering if you wanted to give me away. 
Well, i'm going out of town. 
But i should be back in time for the wedding. 
I'd be honored. 
Piper has turned into bridezilla. 
You, uh, you nervous about the wedding? 
No, no, no, just excited to meet your folks, that's all. 
Where's piper? 
- She said she'd be here. 
Michael! 
- There's my baby! 
- Hey, mom! 
Hey, dad. 
Good to see you. Uncle gerald. Bring it here. 
- You better come here. - Aunt vonice. 
You all look great. So this is the montecito. 
It certainly is impressive. 
You look so skinny. 
What are they feeding you? 
I'm danny. 
His best friend. 
Oh, that's the boy who got the big job instead of mike. 
He don't look so smart. Well, no, he doesn't. 
Oh, this is my mom and dad, 
- Thelma and eugene cannon. 
- Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, sir. My dear uncle gerald... 
deacon gerald. Oh, the deacon. Nice to meet you. 
And my beautiful aunt vonice. Mmm. 
Let me ask you. Are you gonna give a stag party for my favorite nephew? 
Uh... uh, yes, ma'am. 
Well, you make sure you invite his daddy and his uncle gerald. 
Yes, ma'am. 
When do we get to meet the bride? Yes! Well, uh, oh! 
Here she is now, everybody. 
Hi. This is piper. 
When were you gonna tell us she was a white girl? 
Mom. Oh, baby. 
Look at you. 
You've popped. I know, i know. 
You look magnificent. 
My god, mom, look at you. 
Oh, you like? 
Where did you get that outfit? 
Well, you know, i'm not supposed to say. I mean, they might be able to track us down. 
- Paris. 
- How's daddy? 
Oh, i'm sure he's off playing spy with his cia buddies in iraq, afghanistan, who knows where. 
He was fine when i left him. 
- When you left him in france? 
- When i left him, left him. Your dad and i are through, delinda. 
Let's go see your wedding dress. 
So i finally get to meet the family, huh? 
I think they really like me, right? Yeah. Yeah. 
So, uh, does your dad ever say anything? 
Oh, yeah, he might have smiled once when the bears won the super bowl. 
What about your uncle? What's his story? 
Oh, he's a deacon at his church. My aunt vonice and uncle gerald have been married for 40 years. 
Best marriage i've ever seen. 
It's gotta be solid. She had him invited to the bachelor party. Which, by the way 
" 2100 hours, light snacks. " First round of shots. 
Ê ® µã ° ë óéàö ¿ ªê ¼ 2230, entertainment arrives." 
I am coordinating this last night of freedom with military precision, man. 
Yeah. Yeah. 
About the entertainment- - Mm! 
Wait till you see these women, man. 
They put on a whole show. 
It's really something. 
You know my father and my uncle are coming. 
Not to mention cooper. 
So, danny. Danny. I don't want to be looking at strippers in front of my boss, 
Not to mention my family. We're just gonna have a little fun, mikey. 
We're not gonna do anything. Come on. 
I mean, i wish i could invite my dad and my uncle. - I know, but... 
- But what? 
What do you suggest? 
Maybe a nice dinner, some good wine. 
Yeah, you have dinner. I'm gonna look at naked girls. Okay? 
I've gotta go. Make sure that stuff is ready. 
Oh, you look terrific! 
- Sam, you look beautiful. 
- Thanks. 
- So you left ed. 
- Yeah, finally.Can you believe it? 
All those times i threatened him," it's me or the montecito," I finally got the balls to just do it. 
- Well, good for you. 
- Sam, Living as fugitives can be very stressful. 
Maybe 
They're just taking a break. 
Sure. 
Fat chance. 
Sorry to interrupt. Sam. Yeah. 
Mom, i'd like to introduce you to... 
Is this your mother? Julian. 
Cooper. 
Cooper owns the montecito. Oh. 
How are you finding the casino business? 
Equal parts elation and confusion. 
- Sam, could you come to my office tomorrow? 
- Uh, sure. 
- Nice meeting you, julian. 
- See you around. 
-" See you around"? 
- What? 
" See you around"? 
How come you didn't tell your parents i was white? 
It doesn't make any difference. 
Then why was it the first thing out of your mother's mouth when she was squeezing the life out of me? 
Did you tell your mom i'm black? 
I wasn't the one who planned this wedding. Aha! 
F.Y.I., delinda and i are going to the jewelry store tomorrow, 
And with all the money that you're saving on this wedding, You're gonna buy me a ring. 
A big one. 
- Vic. - Danny. 
- Hey, what brings you to vegas? 
- Sam marquez. 
Ah, many have tried, few have lived to tell the tale. 
Uh, i didn't mean that. 
I'm sorry to hear about your brother. 
- No offense taken. 
Thank you. 
What are you, uh, what are you doing later tonight? 
We're having a little bachelor party. 
- Uh, for who? 
- Me and mike. 
You're both getting married? 
I guess it's something in the water. 3543 at 8 : 00. 
- Is cooper coming? 
- Yeah. 
You know cooper? 
Yeah, just met him. 
I'll be there. 
Okay, see you then. 
Yeah. 
And so it begins. 
To us. 
Look at this one. 
Slow down there, girl. That's like $ 100, 000. 
How much do you think mike makes a year? 
You don't know how much your husband makes a year? 
- What if i make more than him? 
- Don't ever tell him. 
You're so right. Why not? 
- Mom! 
- It's true. 
Come on, guys, let's wake up. - It's all you, danny. 
I call. 
- Two pair, kings over jacks. 
- Trip nines. 
Your deal. 
I'll cut you for it. - I get high card, 
- You take my deal. 
You get it, i walk. You never hear from me again. 
- You'd bet $ 400 million on one card? 
- One card. 
If you'd have earned that money instead of inheriting it, That might not be so easy. 
Why not show us that big set of balls you're so famous for? When you're old enough to shave, come back and we'll talk. 
Hey, guys, i'm gonna call it a night. 
Oh, well, cooper, thank you for everything. Sure. 
All right, thank you. 
See you at the altar. Okay. 
Yeah, yeah, so, uh, No naughty nurse or some chick with a tiny little cop getup. 
No, no, no, no, no, i cancelled them just like you wanted. There will be no 
Girls in tight, little cop uniforms With the tiny shorts, and the belt, and the handcuffs. 
Don't you worry, you're gonna get your sausage party tonight. 
It's not... well, thank you for respecting my wishes. 
I feel uncomfortable with my pops here. 
So where's your uncle gerald anyway? 
He's on chicago time. He's probably asleep. 
This party freakin' blows. 
Haven't we already had our share of fun? 
No, mike, we haven't had our share of fun. 
We have had our share. Man, i prefer to think of this As a place where we can reconnect with old friends, 
Like my main man greg here. 
How are you feeling, greg? 
Hey, what's happening? Thanks for inviting me. 
Always glad to have you. 
- Hey, can i ask you guys something? - Of course. Sure. 
Does this look infected to you? Uh...

* gentlemen, may i introduce madam emily and officer tiffany. 
There is a god! 
Uncle gerald, i- - Mix me a courvoisier and coke and try not to block the view. 
- Are you the other dancer? - I am looking for sam marquez. 
- Tell her it's vic. - Oh! Ah! 
You're casey's brother? 
Yeah. Come here. Ah! 
You're cute. 
Go get her, go get her. 
Just a minute. 
You young folks call this krunk dancin'. 
It ain't new. Back when we invented it, we called it 
The" cotton candy." 
Do you remember how i told you--I told you about that whole- 
- The whole deadwood thing? 
I want you to have everything that your heart desires, 
And i know that you will learn to love me too. - You're drunk. 
- Very. 
But this is what i came to vegas for. 
Samantha jean marquez... jane. 
Uh! My bad. 
- Samantha jane marquez... - No, no, no, no, no. 
Shh! 
- Will you marry me? 
- Ok yeah 
Vic and sam, huh? 
Where the hell does that one come from? 
I can think of a billion reasons. 
Îò ¾ õµãëûõæµäºü ° ® ëý well, i think he really loves her. 
Regardless, what kind of a guy gets drunk and just proposes? 
Or, you know, maybe it could work out. 
Have you seen your uncle gerald? 
He didn't come home last night. 
Where you been? 
Good morning, everyone. 
- This is tiffany. 
- Hey. 
Vonice, it's happening in vegas, and i'm staying in vegas. 
A--Aunt vonice, i'm sure it's not the way it looks. 
You were in charge of that stag party last night. What happened to my gerald? 
You better have an answer for me, boy, and quick. 
Hi, you wanted to see me? 
Vic manning filed two losses this morning one to invalidate his brother's will, 
The other to invalidate the sale of the montecito to me. 
What are you gonna do? 
You're sleeping with the enemy. I'm not gonna tell you. 
Come here. 
This is why i said no to your high-Roller idea. 
You're building a new tower? 
2, 000 new rooms, all suites, doubling the size of the casino. 
- Why didn't you just tell me? 
- I told you to be patient. 
I wasn't gonna build you a high-Roller area Because i was building you an entire high-Roller floor. 
Well, my relationship with vic doesn't have anything to do with this. 
I'm not sure i can risk believing you. 
But i wish you both lots of happiness. 
Where are you going? 
There's some things i have to take care of. 
Cooper just took off, probably on his way to new york to talk to his lawyers. 
Oh, and mitch tracked down that tiffany. 
So i guess i'll have to have a little chitchat with her. 
What about you? You talk to uncle gerald? 
- It makes you think though. 
- I seen it a hundred times. Vegas makes people do crazy things. 
How does a guy married for so many years just go off the reservation like that? 
Maybe it gets old. 
You know, maybe marriage just gets old after a while. 
- It only gets old if you let it, right? 
- Is anyone having second thoughts? 
- Me too. 
It's too late. You're already married. 
- I'm too young to be married. 
- On what planet? 
My mom leaves my dad after 35 years. 
I mean, what does that say about me and danny? 
I don't want to get married just because i'm pregnant. 
I'm so scared we're gonna have the baby and then get a divorce. 
Why are you getting married? 
I mean, you're the last person i would expect to do something this impulsive. 
Vic and i have this very special connection, And i feel like he's never gonna try to change me. 
So that's nice. Also, i'm still in love with casey and i see him every time i look at vic's face. 
God, we're all screwed up. 
Ladies, please feel free to choose from anything in the store, compliments of mr. 
Manning. Oh. 
Well i'm already married, so what the hell. 
I'm gonna get a ring. 
Guys like gerald used to be players back in the day. 
Now they're just old. 
- You're breaking up a marriage. 
- He's just vegas-Crazy. He just wants to feel like he can pull some fine ass one more time. 
Uh, well i'm sure that you got his money. So send him back to his wife Or what? 
I don't have any warrants. 
I didn't do anything illegal. 
- Maybe i like him. 
- We're talking about my best friend's uncle. 
- And i'm president of this hotel. 
- You don't have anything on me. 
Well then i'll make something up. 
Who do you think they're gonna believe? 
I know i lost my head.I'm sorry if i embarrassed you in front of your friends. 
There's a lot of temptation in this town. 
It hits you like lightning, boy. 
I got booty-Struck. 
40 years i've been married to your aunt. 
Hasn't all been peaches and cream, you know? 
You gotta go back with your tail between your legs And eat a big slice of humble pie. 
I guess you're right. 
Hell, hillary took bill back. 
I'm sure your aunt would do the same for me. 
One day you'll see, mike. 
It sucks getting old. 
What i wouldn't give to do the cotton candy with that one last time. 
Ha, to be more careful. 
You girls all ready for the big day? 
- Absolutely. - So ready. 
The montecito jet went down on its way to new york. - Where? 
- Somewhere in western colorado. 
The fuselage broke in two on impact. 
Pilot's in a coma. Everyone else is dead. 
What's wrong? 
The montecito jet crashed on the way to new york. 
I saw cooper pack his suitcase. 
He said he was gonna be gone for a couple of days. 
He told me the same thing. 
Pilot's in a coma, but otherwise there were no survivors. 
Look at that. It can take days to get through all that wreckage. 
- Any word on the pilot? 
- He's still unconscious. 
You know, maybe there's a chance that he... 
No one else on that aircraft could've survived, danny. 
This place is cursed. It's not your fault. 
Nah, i should've said something. 
He went to see his lawyers because i filed a lawsuit to get the hotel back. 
If anything, it's my fault. - Don't buy the montecito 
- Why? 
Because casey, monica, now cooper... 
You own this place, you won't live a year. 
He was gonna give me away. 
I know, honey. 
I know. 
I'm telling you, it's an omen. 
What are you talking about? 
These weddings weren't supposed to happen. 
I mean, think about it. 
- You were having second thoughts. 
- I was not having second thoughts, mom. 
Sweetie, i'm your mother. I know you better than you know you. 
Cooper was so excited about the baby, and with daddy being gone, it's just all so sad. 
So out of respect, cancel the wedding. 
What are we gonna do? All those people came all this way. 
We can't have the weddings... 
Even though he would probably want us too. 
- Yeah, but piper's a mess. 
- Really? 
All right, i'll... 
That's it, then, we'll just... we'll turn the wedding ceremony into a memorial service 
What are you gonna say? 
What are you gonna say? 
You were closest to him. 
Uh, you're the better public speaker. 
You're president of operations. 
Mike, i just started getting to know the guy. 
And he mostly just messed with my head, so... 
- He got a kick out of winding you up 
- You too. 
Okay, okay, i guess i'll come up with something. 
- I thought this was supposed to be a wedding. 
- Uh, yeah. Slight change of plans. 
Do you, uh... You don't happen to know anything sad. 
Sad songs? Yeah, are you kidding? 
Okay, good, thank you. I'll be back in just a minute. 
We're here today to celebrate the life and the accomplishments 
Of mr. A.J. Cooper. 
And to reflect on what it was that he meant to each of us. 
Tell you what he meant to be, nothing. I only met the man for five minutes.

For that I will kill you. 
I will not let you escape. 
Told you to shut up. 
Put the gun down.

Somebody get something before it was bleeding. 
Begin to search the plane. 
How long? 
I do not know. 
As soon as this well, I who moved to the hospital. 
I want to put this body. 
And not the remove from your view. 
Matthews. What do we have? 
Nothing. 
Is this right? 
If 
Listen. You have value and appreciate it. 
I'm just... So all left.

Premiere is Grounme Crouse. Yes blue. Want to try? 
Or they will not join me? Grip.

Thank you. 
Cool, but I wanted the wine. 
Is that what you're looking for? 
Red Mercury 
Well done. 
Knights each box of wine. It will be completely isolated It is too bad. 
That thing. 
She is very beautiful. 
If. But it is certifiable. 
Nobody is perfect. 
You're right about that. 
What was that? 
Not bad. But what can you do better. 
I'm not going anywhere 
Put it at zero. 
That's my boy. 
Previously, on Las Vegas : 
I'm A.J. Cooper, and I just bought the place. 
- Hey, Mr. Cooper. 
- Hey, Mike. 
- Cooper. 
- Such a kiss-ass. 
Sam, you were kidnapped, and shuttled onto a jet which the kidnapper flew out of. 
You're Delinda. 
Former boss' daughter. 
And you're having Danny's baby. 
- It is Danny, right? 
- Yeah, Danny. 
You know, this" becoming a dad" thing" has got all kinds of perks I didn't know about. 
- Piper Nielson. 
- Oh, strong handshake. 
- I don't date older guys. 
- What's his story, anyway? 
A.J. Cooper owns the largest working cattle ranch in Wyoming. 
Net worth : somewhere north of $ 2 billion. 
- Uh, two caramel macchiatos, right? 
- Excellent, you bet. 
- Uh, not for me, thanks. 
- She's on" the zone." 
Oh, well you look great! 
I mean, whatever you're doing, it's... it's, uh, working. 
Not that you didn't look great last time you were here, because you looked very voluptuous. 
It's okay, I was a tub. 
And now, I have lost 46 pounds. 
Her goal is to fit into her grandmother's wedding dress. 
- I'm almost there. 
- Aw, that's so nice. 
Well, as long as you don't lose the appetite for the blackjack, right? 
Not me! 
I was actually going to hit the gym first, but I'll meet up with you guys later? 
Okay, great. 
- Um, okay. - Bye. 
- Don't tell me... 
- I don't think I can marry her, Sam. 
What am I gonna do? 
You're gonna gamble. 
That's what you're gonna do. 
* I like big butts and I cannot lie * you other brothers can't deny * * that when a girl walks in with a itty 
- Bitty waist * * and a round thing in your face * * you get sprung, wanna pull up tough * *' cause you notice that butt was stuffed * * deep in the jeans she's wearing * 
* I'm hooked and I can't stop staring * 
Excuse me. Let me ask you something, Danny. 
Does everyone look a bit more... 
Oh, it's the, uh, love' em large convention this weekend over at the Tropicana. 
People come from far and wide. 
They pack pretty much every hotel on the strip. 
They're likely to kill us at the all-you-can-eat buffet. 
So what are you, uh, you goin' bowling? 
Well, yeah, I was very flattered. 
The landscaping department asked me to be on their team. 
- There's a big regional tournament over at the fairlanes. 
- Nice. Yeah, but sometimes these things can turn into a bit of a marathon. 
So I was hoping you could handle some business for me while I'm gone. 
There's something I've admired a long time, and it's come up for sale. 
Not a problem. 
Good, I'll have the jet fueled and ready in an hour. 
- The jet? 
- Yeah. 
- Where am I going? 
- Wyoming. 
- To buy what? 
- A horse. 
- Yeah, I don't really know anything about horses. 
- No, you don't need to. 
You'll be bidding on three-year-old named hay maker's mark. 
- Yeah, but I... 
- Trust me on this. 
Now here's the deal : 
The owner hates me. 
There is no way he would sell me this horse. 
But he doesn't know you. 
All due respect, uh, this isn't really Montecito business. I'm president of operations... 
I want this horse, so I'm asking you as a favor. 
All right, that might be fun. 
So am I gonna see the grand tetons? 
Probably not, but I'm sure you'll see some nice ones. 
a D e S t o Production 
It probably won't surprise you to know that I'm an equine expert. 
Well, not so much an expert as a well-informed dabbler. 
Well, the sports book doesn't count, Mike. 
We're talking about a reining horse, not a racing horse, okay? 
Excuse me. 
I don't know anything about those. 
But I can read up on the plane. 
Don't you think one of us should say back here and look after things? 
What if something happens? 
Tuesdays. 
Statistically, tuesdays are uneventful. 
And Mitch is here. 
I trust Mitch. 
- Don't you trust Mitch? 
- That's good cream filling... 
Uh, yeah, yeah I trust him. 
I trust him, it's just that I don't understand why you want to go to Wyoming. 
Are you kidding? 
Cooper's phat ranch? 
Fresh air, farmer's daughters. 
And not to mention your two vacation days that don't roll into the next fiscal year? 
- Which starts when? 
- Friday. 
I know you. 
Show me. 
That much. 
That's not heaping. 
You can't be chintzy with the bean count, Miguel. 
Do you want a rich cup of coffee, or a weak one? 
- Rich. 
- Rich! 
- Rich. 
- That's right! 
Delinda? 
It's still a little weak. 
- But it's getting better. 
- We're working on it. 
Well, what isn't getting better is the restaurant. 
I ate there last night. 
I apologize. 
Ever since the wolfgang departure, it's been a struggle. 
- You need to hire a new chef. One who can cook. 
- I know, I know, you're right. 
What's wrong? 
You all right? 
The baby. 
It hit me. 
Oh, no, I think that's called a quickening. 
May i? 
Have any kids yourself? 
I mean, you seem to know a lot about babies. 
I was just wondering. 
So, the restaurant. - New chef. 
Got it. 
- Could you handle this before I get back? 
- How long will you be gone? 
- Long enough to win a big gold trophy. 
Well, you know they don't really make' em out of gold. 
Don't ruin it for me, Delinda. 
Sorry. 
They're pure gold. 
I don't feel anything. 
It's not all the time. 
It's... It's sometimes. 
Danny! 
Home on the range time. 
Okay, all right, uh, I gotta go. 
But I'll feel it when I get back, okay? 
- Okay, remember, i get to feel it first! 
- Okay! 
What? 
- What what? 
- Don't" what what" me. 
You didn't blink, and I know all your tells. 
What's going on? 
Okay, I let someone else feel it already. 
We had a deal! 
Who was it, Sam? 
- Yes, it was Sam. 
- Danny boy! 
- Where the deer and the antelope get down. 
- Okay, okay. 
You know what, she did this to spite me because I didn't give gordon fisk more credit. 
- She doesn't even like babies. 
- I know, I know, it was a total waste! 
I hate her! 
All right, okay. I may not have a signal out in the boondocks, but I'll try to call you later. 
- No worries. 
I love you. 
- I see you! 
- What's his problem? 
- Beats me. 
- What's wrong with you? 
- Nothing. 
My whale doesn't want to marry his fiancee. 
He wants me to keep her busy while he does god knows what with who. 
You know, if I actually cared, I might draw a line in the moral sand, and tell her. 
- Good thing you don't have a conscience. 
- Yeah. 
What was that? 
The baby. 
It's called quickening. 
Whatever. 
At least I'm not a total liar. 
Excuse me, hey. Um, where's the concierge? 
Oh, it's uh, right there, where it says" Concierge." 
Not that one. I'm looking for Piper Nielson. 
- Oh, she's not on for another hour. 
- Cool I'll just wait for her in the bar. 
Ah, clean air. 
Wide open spaces! 
I'm feelin' at home already. 
Yeah, well, you and those $ 200 jeans are gonna fit right in here. 
- They look good, don't they? 
- Don't ask me that, seriously. 
Hey, what about you, in your $ 80 jeans. 
These are genuine cowboy pants, dude, these are the ones that real cowboys wear. 
- That tight? 
- Maybe not quite this tight. 
Right. 
- This must be us, right? 
- Yeah, he said the keys were under the seat. 
High security. 
- Want to hear about reining horses? 
- Nope. They're fascinating animals. 
- I don't care. 
- By the time 
I'm done, you will care, my friend. 
These horses go beyond impressive. 
- You don't care that I don't care, do you? 
- Not really. 
I knew I should have come alone. 
- Hi. 
- Hi! 
- How's your workout? 
- Oh, feelin' the burn. 
Got to work on these love handles. 
- You look great. - Aw, thanks. 
- I don't even know if Rodney deserves you. 
- Oh, no, this is all for him. 
He deserves a woman he can be proud of. 
I should probably shower and get to the tables. 
- He likes me to be there, for good luck. 
- Actually, that's why I stopped by. 
Rodney wanted me to let you know that he's doing great. 
He's on quite a roll at the craps table. 
- You could just stay here, if you want. 
- Really? I mean, I'm sure you know Rodney's a little superstitious. 
So you might not want to go down there, because you could, uh, you might, you know, throw off his chi. 
True. 
Maybe I could go to the spa after this. 
That's perfect! 
You are always thinkin', Sam. 
Yeah, sometimes too much. 
- Okay! 
- Bye. 
- Hey. Uh, there's a guy waiting for you in Opus. 
Is he 300 Ibs and asking for the mm factory? 
No, he's more like a short, metrosexual boy-band type. 
With a guitar. 
* and even though I lost her * she never looked so beautiful * * from up here * whoa whoa * a million faces in the crowd * * and you will always shine them out * * she never looked so beautiful * 
* from down here * living illusions, darling 
* I can't face the truth 
* I see the dream of you and me * * but it's not meant to be * another disaster * my heart has been shattered again * * it's 2 : 00 am in the morning * and I'm crying out 
* I'm drying out * lying in my bed * whoa whoa * a million faces in the crowd * and you will always shine them out * * she never looked so beautiful * * from down here * 
See, these horses, they're all about precision. 
They can do perfect circles, pivots, 180 degree changes in any direction. 
They can go from a gallup to a complete stop. 
- I remember when I was a kid this horse just stepped on the tip of my sneaker with his back, uh, his hoof. - Boom. 
On a dime! 
I barely made it out of those sneakers alive. 
How much is Cooper willing to pay for this hay maker's mark? 
He didn't give me a limit, he just said he had to have the horse. 
Everybody's got a limit, Danny. 
Even Cooper. I think we should call him. 
I think you should call him. 
I'm driving. 
It's not safe. 
No bars. 
Ah, it's all right. 
What? Ow, a bug. 
Yeah, funny. 
City-slicker. 
Oh, crap. 
Is that why they call it this? 
Never thought about that. 
- Hi. 
- Hey, Sam! 
- Hey, how's everything going? 
- Good, fine. 
- Good. 
- Yeah, you, uh, you just said that. 
I set up the spa for Sherry. 
So she'll be there for about an hour and a half. 
And, you know, maybe two hours if she decides to take a steam. 
- And then what? 
- I thought maybe you could man up. 
Hi, sam. 
Hello! 
- Hello. 
I remember you. 
- Kira. 
Yeah, you're the one who was trying to win the pick-up truck in the contest. 
Guilty. 
Uh, I'm sorry, weren't you really religious or something? 
Like," all gamblers are sinners and lost souls." That was you, right? 
What can I say? 
It's those flaws that make us special. 
Well, that's true, isn't it? 
There's a whole lot of special going on around here lately. 
Right, Rodney? 
Could you excuse us for a minute? 
It was great to see you. 
You too. 
I'm gonna talk to Sherry. 
I swear I am. 
Okay, listen to me... 
I'm sure you know that I value you as a client. 
And, you know, I like you okay personally. 
But I'm not gonna run interference for you for three days while you cheat on your fiancee. 
I'm not cheating. 
I just need a little more time while I figure out how to word things. 
- I don't want to hurt her. 
- You realize you're gonna break this girl's heart. 
She gave up her career for you. 
She's trying to cram herself into her grandmother's Wedding dress for you. 
I know that, and I feel terrible. 
Really, I do. 
You're a sensitive, well-spoken woman. 
What do you think I should say? 
You know what, first of all, don't ever call me sensitive. 
And second of all, you know what, I'm not helping you. 
I'll keep her busy for a little while longer, and then you're on your own. 
How ya'll doing'? 
I can see where Cooper gets his friendly attitude. 
What's everybody looking at? 
Definitely looking at me. 
Think it's my jeans? 
It's, uh, definitely the jeans. 
- Hey there, big Fella. 
- Hey, I got our paddle. 
I do love a good auction. 
69. I really hope we find hay maker's mark. 
- What's wrong with you? 
- Nothing. 
He's a beauty, huh? 
Yeah, he looks just like the one that stepped on me. 
- He can't be. 
You were 10. 
- Yeah, I was kidding. 
All right, let's go find the one we're buying, see if we can get a good at her. 
- Him. 
- Whatever. Yeah. 
Dude, you're all puffy. 
What's up? 
Oh, my god. I think I'm allergic to the horses. 
If you're allergic to horses, why would you come? 
You know what, um, let's... 
let's... go outside, get some fresh air. 
- That's a good idea. 
- You got the keys? 
Hey, uh... - Where do I find hay maker's mark? 
- He just got pulled from the auction. 
The owner's changed his mind. 
I don't want you to go to any more trouble than you already have. 
Are you kidding me? You're celebrating a new size. 
You need to go shopping... it's Vegas. 
I'm just gonna tell Rodney you'll be back in a few hours. 
Well, I have been wanting to go shopping at Ceasar's. 
- Hey David. 
- Hey. - Where's Piper? 
- She didn't show. 
Nobody can find her. 
Just saw her at the gym. 
David, will you do me a favor, and please take care of my very good friend Sherry? 
And make sure she has a limo at her disposal for the of the day? 
You got it. 
I'm sorry to have dragged you away from pai gow, Ted. 
But you are an expert. 
I was hoping maybe you could help me pinpoint the problem with the food. 
- It really sucks. 
- So I do need a new chef. 
I'd be happy to fire the one who cooked this. As a matter of fact, it would be a pleasure. 
As much as I hate confrontation, I should probably do this myself. 
So who do you think we should get to replace him? 
Any thoughts on who's available? 
You want me to say" me," don't you? 
- I was hoping you would. 
- Sorry, Delinda, no can do. 
I've got a new season of top chef coming up, I've got the promotional tour for my cookbook. 
I'm slammed. 
You know who you should see? 
Meko. 
Very talented. 
You'll adore. 
I adore already. 
You think something happened to Piper? 
I don't know. 
She was in the gym before her shift. 
Then she never showed up. 
Well, there she is leaving the gym. 
She's getting into the elevator. 
Then she comes out into the lobby. 
Where the hell is she going? 
What a wonderful presentation, Meko. 
- You try. - Oh, no, no thank you. I'm pregnant. 
You pull my leg. 
Pregnant? 
Clearly. Oh, no, I just kidding! 
Fish is fresh! 
Good for you! 
Well, I'm not really supposed to eat raw fish because of the bacteria and mercury content. 
Non sense! 
Generation of japanese women eat raw fish, have baby. 
My mama, she eat fish. 
Her mama, she eat fish. 
Her mama, she eat fish. 
You eat the fish! 
- Well, you have a lot of fire in your chart. 
- Eh? 
It's a choice, Meko. 
My choice as a mother. 
So, thank you, but I'm not eating it. 
- I quit! 
- But I didn't hire you. 
Wishy-washy american woman! 
Fire sign! 
- Pardon me. 
- Oh, sorry. 
Auction's about to start. 
You goin' inside? 
Oh, I can't. 
I had to get out of there. 
- I'm allergic. 
- Oh, god, me too! 
I mean, not to horses, but to shellfish and strawberries. 
Actually, all kinds of berries, really. 
I've gotta carry an epi pen in my purse all the time, just to be safe. 
- You gonna be all right? - Oh, yeah, yeah. I think I feel better. 
Oh, my lord! 
Help! 
Somebody help! 
Look, I'm sorry you came all this way from north Dakota for nothing. 
I just can't get rid of her. 
Oh, this is bad. 
This is bad for me. 
There's a couple of fantastic reining horses in there. 
You should take a look at barker's landing. 
No, no, no, no, this is the horse for me. 
- Why? 
- Why? 
I mean, look at her... him. 
Look at him. 
I mean, he's... he's, uh, he's special. 
This horse is one-of-a-kind. 
That's exactly why I'm not selling him. 
Okay, name your price. 
Whatever it is, I'll pay it. Okay. 
How about $ 1 million? 
Done. 
I was just sorta kidding. 
If the top reining horse goes for $ 750,000, I'll give you... 
I'll give you a million. 
What do you say? 
We got a deal? 
* older women * are beautiful lovers 
* I said older women * they understand * 
There you are. 
Welcome back, safe and sound. 
- What happened? 
- Anaphylactic shock. 
Luckily, I had my epinephrine with me. 
You saved my life. 
Oh, you would have done the same thing. 
I'm just glad you're all right. 
Thank you. 
You gotta let me do something for you. 
Maybe I could buy you a beer. 
That sounds pretty good on a hot day like today. 
- Yeah. 
- I'm Libby. 
- Mike. 
- Nice to meet you. 
You too. 
Oh, let me get this stuff for you. 
You, um... you work for the Cooper ranch. 
I'm from the city. 
I'm just here with a friend. 
You know A.J. Cooper? 
I've never met him myself. 
- Just curious. 
- Excuse me. 
I better get inside. 
Libby, wait. 
What about the beer? 
Damn. 
So we got a deal? 
I wish we had a deal. 
But to tell you the truth, it's my son, Weston. 
What about him? 
Wes was so broken up when I told him hay maker's mark was going to auction, 
I just couldn't see my boy that way. 
That's why I pulled him. 
I guess I can see how that might be a problem. 
You got kids? 
I got one on the way. 
Congratulations! 
Yeah, thank you. 
You know, even when it doesn't make good business sense, you just want your kids to be happy. 
Whatever it costs. 
I'm sorry, Dan. 
I'm gonna have to say no. 
Well, maybe I could go talk to him. 
I'll tell you what... 
If you can convince that boy there's life after riding', you got yourself a deal. 
Okay, well, you know what, I'll give it my best shot. 
you're welcome to ride back to the ranch with me. 
I mean, he should be home from school by now. 
No, my buddy's with my rig, so I'll just, uh... We'll follow you. 
- Good deal. - Mm-Hmm. 
- Hey, watch it! 
- Sorry about that. 
I don't understand. 
What's Piper doing in a guest room? 
Don't you have more estrogen than me? It's textbook. 
My four-star restaurant just went down to a one-Star, and I just got bitched out by an agro sushi chef. 
I'm off my game. 
Sorry. 
I stopped at the surveillance room, and Mitch tracked her steps. 
She stopped at the front desk, got a key, and checked into room 1940. 
So she's just hiding from this guitar guy, got it. 
Oh, no, you don't think she's gonna be crying, do you? 
Because you're going to have to go in by yourself if she's crying. 
You know I'm not into that stuff. 
You are so damn big, and sexy. 
Then don't stop, and stay with me longer. 
Sex me up. 
Okay! Okay! 
- Isn't that your whale? 
- Yes. 
- But wasn't he... 
- Yes. 
This day's getting worse and worse. 
Let's just stick to one disaster at a time, shall we? 
- Do not disturb! 
- Piper, it's Delinda and Sam. 
Go away! 
I don't feel well! 
I'm probably contagious. 
Well, you're not very good at lying. 
We're gonna have to work on that. 
I'm not lying. 
I'm really sick. 
- Talk to us, sweetie. 
- I don't need to talk. 
Is this about hot guitar guy? 
William. 
Hot guitar guy? 
- What? 
- She's, uh, saying, you know, just when she thought she was over him, he shows up again. 
Well, uh, sure, she's just saying, you know, she can't go back down there because she's tired of him suckering her back in. 
How come you understand her, and I don't? 
Uh, it's just one of the many gifts that I have. 
I actually wish that I did not have it at this moment, so I'm gonna go. - You got this, right? 
- No, no, no, no! I don't got this. 
I mean, you cannot leave me here... 
I mean us. 
My engaged whale's trying to sex up a chubby christian next door. 
I have to go kick his ass before his fiancee shows up. 
But I'm interviewing a chef in an hour. 
Look at her. We can't leave her alone! 
Oh, okay, I'll, uh... 
I'll come check on her later. 
- Reluctantly. 
- Delinda! 
Thank you, thank you. 
Hey, man. I'm Danny. 
- You're a Fergie fan, huh? 
- I guess. 
Me too. 
What a coincidence. 
Yeah, um, a shared admiration for the" lady lumps" is not going to get you my horse. 
Ah, you're a smart kid. 
I can tell already. 
- Yeah, I do okay. 
- You got a girlfriend? 
Please put that down. 
And, uh, no. Actually, I'm not allowed to date until I'm 16. 
- That's harsh. 
- Tell me about it. 
The only thing to do around here is ride. 
You know what, that's all going to turn around in a few years, mark my words. 
- You think? 
- I know. 
You're gonna be older. 
You're gonna be wiser. 
You're gonna have women all over you, trust me. 
I don't know, man. 
- You ever been to Las Vegas? - No. 
That's where I'm from. 
Vegas! 
I know you've seen pictures, 
I mean, the lights, the night clubs are sick, the women are... 
- What kind of women? 
- All kinds of women, whatever you want. 
I mean, we've got singers, actresses, models, voluptuous ones, perky ones, you name it. 
- Promiscuous ones? 
- Yeah. 
I'm gonna make you a deal. 
When you turn 21, I want you to come see me, okay? 
I run this big hotel called the Montecito. 
And you're gonna be my V.I.P. Guest, okay? 
21? 
That's, like, forever from now. 
Okay, 18. 
I'm gonna show you the whole city. 
I'm gonna introduce you to women that you only see on the posters, okay? 
If you're lucky, maybe I'll take you out to this little town called pahrump. 
Ever heard of it? 
I knew you did! 
* the harder I try * to make my escape * you still haunt me 
* the farther I get * the more intense * this separation * leads to desperation * because when you're not close to me * * it's like a freight train is running over me * 
* you're killing me slowly * if only you were lonely * and broken 
* I'd creep into your mind * without you knowing * and rearrange the pieces * when you weren't watching * and leave you with the memory * * that you love me * if only you were lonely 
Thanks a lot. 
Hey, uh, do you remember me? 
Uh, no. 
I asked you about Piper earlier. 
You told me she was coming into work today? 
Oh, right, yeah, I was wrong. 
Uh, she's, uh, she's sick. 
She's got typhoid or something. 
Bummer. Maybe you can tell me where she lives. I could take her some soup. 
Oh, I can't do that. 
Maybe you'll see her next time you're in town. 
You know, I don't have anything to do until tuesday, so maybe I'll just hang out and wait. 
Well, why don't you suit yourself? 
Sam, I got your text message. 
What's wrong? 
Any, uh, particular reason why you chose this weekend to come to Vegas? 
I felt like gambling. 
Oh, really? 
So there's no special draw for you besides tables? 
- What are you suggesting? 
- Look around, Rodney. 
I think you and I both know that it's beef week. 
Beef week, Rodney. Where the chubbies come to celebrate their bigness. 
And the chubby chasers follow, right? 
Chubby chasers like yourself, maybe? 
I didn't know until we got here. 
I didn't plan it. 
- I tried to resist temptation. Honest I did. 
- This is unbelievable. 
This is why you wanna dump Sherry? 
When I met her, she was a size 14. 
Voluptuous. 
She had this adorable muffin-top that spilled over her jeans. 
And then she went on that diet, started exercising, and now she's all... 
Thin! 
I mean, no offense, sam, I just don't find it attractive. 
- When I hit the beach, I like to see waves. - Yeah, okay, I... 
I'm actually trying to fight the imagery here. 
- I'm fighting it too! 
- No, no, no. 
Listen to me. 
This is actually good. 
This is fixable! 
You just need to talk to Sherry. 
Explain to her that you liked her better when she was bigger. 
I'm sure she'd be happy to pack on the pounds once she knows that. 
She loves you. 
I don't know, I think she likes being able to see her feet. 
Listen to me, and you listen to me good. 
I see a lot of lust in my job. 
I don't see much love. 
Last time you two were here, it seemed you had that. 
I remember because it made me queasy. 
Thank you, Sam. 
- You're right. 
- I know. 
I'm gonna tell her. 
- You're having an affair? 
- Lady, what are you doing? 
With her? - Hey! 
My guitar! 
- Is she why we come to this God-awful tacky city? 
Oh, no, no. 
No, no, no. 
No. I'm a chubby chaser. 
He misses your fat. 
Isn't that great? 
It's true. Honeycakes, I do. 
But I don't want to be fat, Rodney! 
Look at me! 
You know what? 
- You said she'd be happy about this. 
- Yeah, I was wrong about that. 
I can't believe that you got my boy to agree to let go of that horse! 
Yeah, I just talked to him man-to-man, that's all. 
The wire transfer went through already. 
- You don't waste any time, Dean. 
- I try not to. 
Hey, it was nice doing business with you, Dean. 
You bet. 
All right then. 
I'll see ya. 
- Take care, now. 
- Okay, you too. 
- Take care of ol' hay maker's mark, too. 
- We will, we will. 
He'll be in good hands, I promise. 
- All right, boys. - Okay 
Oh, spill! 
The milf. Tell me about her. 
So you went into anaphylactic shock, and then what? 
- Is this a joke to you? 
- No. 
Because it was very serious. 
I almost died. 
Well, you didn't. 
So what happened? 
Well, Libby rescued me, that's what happened. 
Capable, earthy, sexy. 
First she straddled me. 
Then she plunged an epi pen into my thigh. 
Read into the subtext there what you'd like. 
It was a transformational experience. 
- A transformational... 
- Yeah. Isn't that at all humiliating? 
- Because it's embarrasing. - No, no, no, no. 
- In fact, libby found my vulnerability charming. 
- But she blew you off. 
That's what I don't get. 
First, she says" yes" to a beer, then, all of a sudden, she just shut it down. 
I think it has something to do with Cooper. 
Y - You weren't supposed to talk about Cooper, remember? 
She saw the keychain, Danny. 
- Started to separate herself from everything. 
- Dude, make something up! 
Make something up? " early." 
- I mean, you could say" candy ranch." 
- Candy ranch! 
" Hey, Libby, I'm Mike from the Candy ranch! 
Pleased to meet you!" 
Why do you think people hate this guy so much anyway? 
- I don't know, did you ask him? 
- Yeah, I asked him about dean white. 
- What'd he say? 
- He just smiled. 
You know how he does that condescending smile? 
At least we got the horse. 
Hey! 
Hey, that's her! 
That's Libby! 
Okay, just tell me that wasn't the white ranch logo on her truck? 
He's in a band. 
And he travels all over the country. 
I think I'm just his Vegas girl. 
We've all been someone's booty-Call, Piper. 
You just have to stop giving the situation power. 
You know, it's like a big juicy grape. 
You got to deprive it of sunlight and oxygen and water, and turn it into a raisin. 
I know. 
- But I love grapes. 
- I know, but raisins are good, too. 
I am never getting married. 
That's big news. 
I'll be back after my interview. 
Take care of her. 
What do you mean? 
What am I supposed to do with this? 
Comfort her! 
Say something optimistic. 
- Motherly. 
- What? 
Uh, you... 
uh, you should... 
You know... 
Buck up! 
And just shake it off. 
- There are lots of musicians in the sea. 
- I want Delinda back! 
Me too. 
I have an idea. 
- Hey, mom. 
- Hey, hun! 
You didn't just sell hay maker's mark to A.J. Cooper did you? 
Hell, no. 
I'd never do that. 
It was some guy from north Dakota. 
Paid a million bucks for him. 
Dad, he's from Las Vegas. 
He told me north Dakota. 
Son of a bitch. 
I have a predilection for traditional French and Italian cuisine, but with a hip flavor. 
I am always open to suggestions. 
I am, as you americans say, a player of the team. 
That sounds wonderful. 
And I love traditional. 
And this risotto with white truffles is to die for. 
Merci. 
I have a very special source in Croatia. 
He always brings me the finest of the white truffles. 
You studied at the cordon bleu, Jean-Jacques? 
We were there at the same time. 
You went to the cordon bleu? 
Yes, I was there for only a year, but we probably know some of the same people. 
Is everything okay, Jean-Jacques? 
You look ill. 
All right. 
My name is Just John. I'm from Toledo. 
- Excuse me? 
- I'm just looking for a hook. 
It's tough out there for a self-taught 
MidWestern guy trying to break into this business. 
So you're faking french? 
But I'm not faking the cooking. 
I really am good at it. 
And I will work my derriere off to make everything that comes out of this kitchen perfect. 
Are you suggesting that I go from wolfgang puck to John from Toledo? 
You're right. 
I'm sorry, I'll go. 
Wait. 
Maybe we could give this thing a trial run. 
The dinner shift is yours. 
- Really? 
That's fantastique! 
- Just... 
Don't talk. 
Thank you Miss Deline, you won't regret this. 
I'm gonna knock your socks off. 
You're talking! 
Start cooking risotto. 
Lots of it. 
Maybe Libby didn't recognize you. 
Yeah, lot of brothers around here in Wyoming. 
She probably confused me with the other black guy she saved today. 
I think maybe we should go a little faster, just to be safe. 
We're pulling a trailer with a million-dollar horse. 
How fast would you like me to go? 
We got the horse, now we need to get it to Cooper's ranch. 
It's two miles away, let's go. 
Uh, I think that's two miles we don't have, partner. 
Take a look. 
Okay, what do we do now? 
We can't take it to the ranch. 
They're gonna be waiting for us. 
- Let's just tell Cooperit was pulled from the auction! 
- No, we can't just return the horse. 
Cooper's gonna know that we wired money from his account. 
So what are we gonna do with the damn horse? 
I think there's only one thing we can do. 
Hey, William. 
That's me. 
- Hey, I wanted to tell you about Piper. 
- She okay? 
Yeah, she's fine. 
Yeah, she's, uh, great, as a matter of fact. 
- Yeah, I thought she was sick. 
- She called in sick, but she actually ran off. 
To get married. 
Crazy in love people do. 
I didn't even know she was seeing someone. 
Oh, yeah. 
Yeah, for like a year. 
He's fantastic, Gary. 
Gar-bear, she calls him. 
He's an investment banker, gorgeous, rich. 
Totally worships her. 
That's good. 
Tell her I said congratulations. 
I'm really happy for her. 
I thought you would be. 
That's why I wanted to tell you,' cause I heard you were waiting around for her. 
- I guess I'm not anymore. 
- Yeah, I guess not. 
- So did you two used to date or something? 
- I wouldn't call it dating. 
Just a casual thing. 
I mean, you know. 
Yeah. 
I think I know. 
Hey, William. 
Are you ready? 
Listen, um, I gotta bolt. 
I met this chick at the bar and, uh... 
- Rebound. 
- Rebound. 
So, uh, this trip wasn't a waste after all. 
Hey, William, next time you're in Vegas, do me a favor. 
- What's that? 
- Don't come back here. 
William's gone. 
Coast is clear. 
- What did he say? 
- Nothing. 
He just... 
left. 
I not start act three again. 
- You know, you don't have to. 
- Wait, wait, what's going on? 
It's, uh, Notting Hill. 
It wasn't on video on command, so Polly came up to perform it for us. 
Foolproof way to mend broken heart. 
- Bourbon's my cure-All. 
- Scoot. 
Okay, recap for new viewer. 
Hugh Grant and Julia Robert, they just sleep together, first time. 
It morning, and she big movie star. 
And she afraid that he hokey-Pokey wrong reason. 
All right, enough of the recap. 
Can't we pick up where we left off? 
You know it's Notting Hill! 
No, you no talking during movie performance. 
" Rita Hayworth used to say, they go to bed with Gilda, they wake up with me.'" 
" Who's Gilda?" 
" Her most famous part. 
" Men would go to bed with the dream, but they didn't like when they woke up With the reality." 
Do you feel that way?" 
" You are lovelier this morning than you have ever been." 
Why can't I find a guy like that? 
-' Cause this is fiction. 
- Men are never like this in real life. 
- They're like Hugh Grant. 
- You see what happens when you get older? 
You just lose the idea of finding that dream guy. 
No, you just give up on expecting them be perfect and learn to live with it. 
- Or not. 
I prefer not. 
- You know what? 
I done. 
You terrible audience! 
Too much talking. 
No! 
Please, please. 
Let's just order room service. 
Congratulations, Augie. 
That your best game ever? 
Yes, it was. 
- Where should we put the trophy? 
- I think you should take it home. 
- You're the caption. 
- Thanks. 
Where's my horse? 
- So you won... huh? 
- Yeah, and I take it you won too. 
- I approved the wire transfer. - Yeah. 
And by the way... 
- A million dollars for a reining horse... 
- Well, hey, you never gave me a limit, so... 
Yeah, well, I guess so. 
Anyway, he's mine. 
So is he at the ranch? 
Uh... actually, no. 
There was a little change of plans. 
Mike ended up having a... a thing. 
- So we ended up coming up with a better plan 
- Which you're gonna love. 
Where's my horse? 
Stay. 
Previously on" one tree hill"... 
You ready for tonight? bring it on. I got this. 
Kind of different in the game. 
How different? Do I even want to ask? 
Really, I'm fine. 
I told you I wanted to be a mom, and you ran away so fast, You left an owen-shaped hole in my front door. 
You're right, and you didn't deserve that. 
I'm sorry. 
You're still a jerk. Hot intern? 
- Mouth! 
- gigi? The nosy guy across the street Called and said he saw someone breaking in. 
That is peyton's wedding dress. 
Someone made an offer for the movie rights to my book. 
For" the comet"? 
that's great! 
Not for the" the comet," but, um," ravens." 
You've gotten even more beautiful. 
What are you doing here, julian? Optioning your fiances book. 
Like hell you are. 
Actually, it's already done. 
I see you two have already met, huh? 
Yes, we have. 
Feels like I've known her for years. 
Oh, my god. you're totally inspired by it. 
- No, I'm not. 
- You are, too. admit it. Your entire new line is gonna be based on 
Based on the amazing couture wedding dress I had already spent 72 hours 
Hand-stitching for my best friend? 
Oh, wait. 
That's ruined. 
You're still pissed. 
And you're still grounded. 
Fine. 
So, what's your version of grounded? 
Well, I've been thinking. 
One week for exposing a 5-year-old to depravity, 
Another week for letting some skeevy fratvestite ruin peyton's wedding dress, and we're gonna tack on another week for throwing an underage keg party 
In your foster parent's upscale boutique. 
That's it? 
You are not supposed to be happy about this! 
No, I just thought that thing my friend eugene did In the bathroom sink was gonna cost me another week. 
You... haven't been in the bathroom yet, have you? 
What did eugene do in the bathroom sink? 
Sam! This is not over, young lady! 
Didn't think it was, old lady. 
Don't kill the child. just don't kill the child. 
What? 
! Wow. where's nice brooke? 
I killed her, and I ate her bleeding heart for breakfast, 
And I'm still hungry. 
Right. 
Well, if you see her, Tell her I enjoyed 
Cleaning up sam-a-palooza with her last night 
And that I plan on bringing her a gift every day Until she's ready to reconsider me. 
Every day? 
Whether you like it or not. 
Gold, godiva, gucci, gerber 
My jewelry, chocolate, purse, and flower preferences. 
I guess I'll be seeing you tomorrow. 
Wait - - gerber? 
Daisies. 
But sunflowers are very nice, too. 
Bye, now. 
You are just in time. 
For what - - hibernation? 
No. 
I saw your slamball schedule for the next three weeks, 
And it looks pretty grueling, 
So I thought you better stock up. 
Haley, 90,000 calories a day is not gonna keep me From getting hit on the slamball court. 
No, but it'll give you a little extra padding when you do. 
I cleared a place for your trophy. 
You know, I don't think they give you trophies in slamball, buddy. 
Not even for champions? 
That's pretty lame, huh? 
How are you supposed to know you're awesome without a trophy? 
Well, I guess you're gonna have to keep telling me. 
Go eat your breakfast in front of the tv, All right, little bear? 
Okay. 
Good luck. 
It's really good. 
How you feeling? 
I think you may have had one too many mojitos at tric last night. 
Ohh, I know - - headache. 
Thanks. 
So, what was your first impression of julian last night, huh? 
Peyton, I love you, 
And I want us to be together forever. 
Luke, wait. it's just not as simple as all of that, okay? 
I mean, there's a lot we have to talk about. 
You're saying no. 
No. I love you so much. 
Just not enough. 
Hey, I need you to go on a coffee run. 
Okay. in a minute. 
I don't have a minute. 
I said I need a minute. 
God! 
Probably just a jam in the three-hole-punch tray total pain in the ass, but definitely not worth a pretty girl crying over. 
You know, the last thing I need right now Is some - - some shallow, egocentric 
Hotshot music producer hitting on me. 
Okay, just for the sake of argument, What if I was more of a failed guitarist 
Turned fledging indie-movie-producer type? 
No. right. 
You know, the best thing about a paper jam? 
What? 
It forces you to open up the machine, 
Figure out what went wrong in the first place. 
He was charismatic. 
What you doing? 
If you haven't heard, I'm a big screenwriter now. 
Screenwriter. 
Luke, about that 
I think I really needed this, you know? 
With everything that happened with" the comet," I just 
It's nice to know 
That your work has merit and relevance, you know? 
Yeah. of course. 
I am nervous, though. 
I mean, julian already has a studio interested. 
And they want a first draft in, like... 
Three weeks. 
Did you even sleep? 
Oh, yeah, a little. 
Eh, not really. no. 
Well, you wouldn't tell from the script. 
It's - - it's good, luke. 
Yeah, but not great. 
Very close to great. 
In fact, I'd say one scene away from great, 
And I think you know exactly which scene I'm talking about 
Keith's murder. And I know you wanted me to show it, 
But I just thought that maybe it'd be more effective 
If we find out after the fact - - you know, cinematically? 
Okay, well, I don't want to flaunt my experience, 
But cinematically, it doesn't get much better Than seeing a man kill his brother. 
Well, that man who was murdered... Was my uncle. 
Which is, I think, why you didn't write the scene. 
You're too close to it. 
But our audience needs to face what happened, luke even if you can't. 
Just give it a try. 
Trust me. 
I'll put off the studio until tomorrow, okay? 
You can do this. 
And if I can't? 
To be blunt, Then I'll find a writer who can. 
I'm broke. 
You're 5. you're supposed to be broke. 
Undefeated for the last three weeks, Fans expect the slashers to be carried through 
Tonight's semifinal slamball game against the mob On the shoulders of former college standout nathan scott. 
That is, of course, unless jerome garret, 
Hit man for the mob, has anything to say about it. 
We're not afraid of nathan scott. 
Man, that chump's always been more hype than skill. 
Well, and there you have it from the hit man himself. 
Back to you guys. 
They should just give you the trophy, daddy. 
I tried to tell you They don't give you trophies in slamball, buddy. 
I checked for you and everything. 
Come on, brooke. 
If you could fill this place up with anything, 
What would it be? 
What did you get me? 
Peyton 
Well, don't act so disappointed. Last time I checked, I was your only customer. 
Yeah. It's a good thing I like the emperor's new clothes. 
I'm sorry. 
It's just that owen's been coming by every day For the last three weeks to bring me loot. 
Well, I did not know you were into him again. 
I'm not totally sure I am yet, but I am into loot. 
Brooke, what owen did was uncool, 
But it is equally uncool to lead him on Just because you like getting presents every day. 
Really? 
I'm getting relationship advice 
From the girl who waited three weeks to tell her fiance 
That he's making a movie with her ex-boyfriend. 
Three weeks and counting. 
Peyton, you haven't told him yet? 
Um, no... but, anyway, changing the subject, 
When do I get to see my wedding dress? 
You may not need a dress, my friend. 
Changing the subject back. 
Lucas is gonna be really upset 
When he finds out you've been keeping this from him. 
I know. 
It's just he's really excited about writing again, 
And he genuinely likes julian, and I don't want my stupid past to get in the way of this for him. 
Well, how serious were you and julian? 
Oh, sorry. sorry. 
Excuse me.I'm sorry. 
Oh, hey, if it isn't the saddest girl in the world. 
I'm not sad. 
Okay, but I've only met you twice, 
And both times, you were crying. 
Maybe they're tears of joy. 
True. are they? 
- No. - okay, good. 
'cause I got a favor to ask. 
How would you like to accompany me To this hideous industry party full of snooty rich people 
And" shallow, egocentric hotshot producer" types? 
That sounds awful. 
So, is that a yes? 
You really want the saddest girl in the world as your date? 
Oh, no. no. no. it's not a date. 
I just want your tears. 
One look at the crying girl on my arm, And nobody's gonna wonder why I'm leaving early. 
Hold on. what'd I say? 
Because if you start smiling like that, 
We're gonna be stuck at this thing. 
Oh, I am totally underdressed. 
No. no. you look great. 
Besides, this is hollywood. The worse you dress, the more important people assume you are. 
Oh, they must assume I'm the pope. 
Oh, wow. thank you. thanks for coming. 
You didn't tell me it was your bar mitzvah. 
It's a fund-raiser for a script I'm trying to get made. 
I know - - talk about boring. 
It's a good thing you brought a book. 
Um... yeah. I was hoping to get it signed. 
I used to be close with the author. 
I feel really dumb for bringing it in. 
Oh, no. don't. what's it about? 
Me, sort of. 
Then I completely understand why you wanted it here with you. 
Now, see, there's that smile again. 
Now we're never gonna get out of here. 
Oh, I guess we'll have to make the best of it. 
Oh, you bet. 
Oh, okay. thank you. 
That was a scout. 
He's passing through town on his way to virginia. He's gonna try to stop by and see the slamball semifinal. 
Well, that's cool, nate. 
If anyone deserves a second look, it's you. 
Hey, speaking of the game, Any hard feelings if I can't make it? 
Julian wants to get the script to the studio tomorrow, 
So I'm sort of in crisis mode. 
No worries, man. I'll see you at the championship after we win tonight. 
Absolutely. 
Can I ask you a question? 
What was your best memory of dan? 
I don't know. the day he went to prison. 
Michael jordan basketball camp. 
Yeah, I was about 10 years old, And dan pulled some strings to get me in, 
And it was the first day, And we were in this, like, meet-and-greet line, 
And jordan was gonna pick one of us kids to play one-on-one against. 
I remember I was so nervous, My knees were about to buckle. 
And I think dan could feel that'cause he put his hand on my shoulder to steady me, 
And when jordan finally came by, He just looked at him and said, 
" this is my son, nathan. he's got a great jump shot." 
And what happened? 
I played one-on-one against the greatest player in history. 
It was one of the best days of my life. 
Why? what's with the question? 
I have this scene to write, and I'm trying to be objective. 
I guess I'm just wondering if dan ever had a soul. 
Sure, he did. 
He sold it a long time ago. 
Bright the man on the way he is evil. 
That is what he deserves. 
So, this is how the great nathan scott Warms up for a semifinal game. 
You, uh, looking for an exclusive? 
I'm here as a friend. 
Jerome garrett was talking about putting you back in your wheelchair during tonight's game. 
He sounded serious. 
Oh, I'm sure he is. he's a bitter guy. 
He was only a basket away from the sweet 16 Two years ago when I got in the way. 
I remember, and from the sound of it, so does he. 
I appreciate the heads-up, mouth. 
I'll be fine, though. I can take care of myself. 
Plus, I got owen watching my back. 
He's one of the toughest guys in tree hill. 
Hello, beautiful. aah! 
What the hell are you doing? ! 
Sneaking up on a girl is so not cool! 
What? I thought you'd like it. 
" what's underneath the clothes," right? I'm a girl. it's sexy. 
You are a huge, hairy dude on my leather seats! 
at least you think I'm huge! Get out! all right! 
All right! 
all right! hey! all right! 
Wait. brooke. hey. 
Wait. you made your point! 
Stop! 
You have my clothes! 
So, pooky wooky bear pretty much finds out 
He's been a crummy friend And has to say he's sorry. 
All right. chapter nine tonight, guys. 
Good job. 
So, don't tell your mom, But that was pretty much the best lecture of the year. 
Uh, I heard that. 
Hey, you have, uh, study hall next, right? yeah. 
Would you mind watching jamie for a little bit? 
I got to run to the office. 
Sure. anything to avoid economics homework. 
Let's go, muchacho. Awesome. 
Sam, no parties, okay? 
What's economics? 
It's how you make money. 
I thought that was called an allowance. 
No. 
An allowance you actually have to work for. 
Economics is easier. it's just supply and demand. 
Sounds complicated. 
No. this is your stake. 
You use it to buy your supply, which is what you just got. 
All you need to do is create a little demand. 
Come on, man. that's nasty. Bummer, huh? 
good thing we got everything you want right there. 
I'll take some chips. 
2 bucks. 
You only paid 50 cents for those. 
That, grasshopper, is called a profit. 
I don't have 2 bucks. 
It's okay. that's called a kickback. it's free. 
That is what you get when you're in cahoots. 
Nice. 
Hey. you okay? Yeah. 
No. no. 
Um, I have to write keith's murder scene in the screenplay, 
And i... don't know if I can do it. 
I just can't imagine people sitting in a theater 
Eating popcorn, watching keith get shot to death. 
Maybe it could be more than that. 
Maybe... like in literature, 
A violent death can often be a catalyst for change 
Or... a lesson in humanity. 
I don't want my audience to understand dan scott, okay? 
I don't want to make dan scott a more conflicted character For the sake of a more complex plotline. 
Dan scott isn't human. 
He doesn't deserve to be forgiven. 
Frankly... 
Dan scott doesn't deserve a spot in jamie's life. 
Luke. 
I'm sorry, hales. it's none of my business. 
My head's just been... 
I should go. I'm sorry. 
Look, I get it, and I love the band, And you know I love you, 
But this ship is gonna sail without you If you guys can't cut through all the red tape. 
Well, if you can't cut through that red tape, Then I'll find somebody who can. 
This may come as a surprise to you, But you're not the only line producer in town. 
Be nice. 
Look, josh, uh, I know you're trying. 
Just do me a favor and try a little harder. 
It's all gonna get done. 
I think it's a bad idea that I moved in with you. 
Why? 
Because if I get any nicer, 
My film's not gonna get to sundance. 
Oh, but you'll get me, And I am way sexier than sundance. 
I love you. 
I love you, too. 
Thanks for picking me up, grandpa. 
Are you kidding me? I'd do anything for you. 
Can you stake me 10 bucks? 
What for? 
I... got some business. 
I don't know. that's a lot of money. 
Please. I'll totally cut you in. 
Sounds like a solid investment. Sweet. 
I also have to make a quick stop on the way to school. 
You're the boss. 
I'm not writing this. 
I thought julian said he'd find another writer. 
I'm hoping he's bluffing. 
You want to tell me why this is so hard? 
I don't really know What happened in keith's final moments, 
And I'm not gonna just make it up So that julian's movie can be more dramatic, you know? I mean - 
- I mean, think about it. 
Did he... did he beg for mercy? 
Did he - - did he cry? 
Was he shocked? 
did he feel betrayed? 
Or maybe dan should be... 
Conflicted and, uh... 
Pitiable. 
I can't write that. 
Do you know what I love about you 
Is that you're always protecting everybody? 
But you don't have to protect keith, 
And, I mean, regardless of what the scene becomes, I'm pretty sure he would rather you 
Write his last moments than anybody else. 
I just wish I knew the truth. 
Got to go. 
Okay, but I can't get my bag zipped up. 
It's three days in sundance. 
How full can your bag possibly be? 
Like this full. 
You got to be kidding. 
Oh, maybe my big, strong boyfriend Can use his muscles to zip it up for me. 
We are so gonna miss our plane. 
Thank you. 
Well, I think I found the problem. 
I was just gonna read it on the plane. 
For what - - the thousandth time? 
It's not a big deal. No, it is a big deal. 
It's just a book. 
Come on. 
You buy copies of this thing every time you see it. 
You carry one around in your purse half the time. 
You think it's lost on me That it was written by your ex-boyfriend? 
So it's important to me. 
I mean, do you think it's lost on me 
That you've never bothered to read it? 
Are you curious at all? 
Yeah, I'm curious. 
I'm curious as to whether there will ever come a day When I'm not sharing you with lucas scott. 
You know what? I'm tired of this. 
Where are you going? 
Sundance, alone. 
What? 
You want to go with the book... 
Be my guest. 
Get a nice suite, go skiing, cozy up by the fire, 
And talk about your future together. 
I really hope both of you are very happy. 
Julian. 
I can't do this anymore, peyton. 
I don't want to. 
Goodbye. 
Nice brooke would like to apologize For the way that evil brooke acted this morning. 
Well, you should've stuck around. 
I mean, you haven't lived until you've been naked 
In the back of a squad car that smells like bum piss. 
How about you just keep whatever gift you were bringing today, And we call this whole mess even? 
I didn't bring a gift, and I'm done bringing them. 
You know, winning you back is one thing, But being led on, it's... 
It's humiliating. 
I just came by to tell you that 
I won't bother you anymore. Owen. 
I'll see you around, brooke davis. 
So, you still got some stuff? 
Whatever you want. 
2 bucks. 
2 bucks? ! 
that's a total rip! 
Fine. guess you're gonna have to wait till snacktime. 
I hear we're having raisins. 
That's my whole allowance. 
Economics pays better! 
Excuse me. 
Why are you here? 
Is - - is that a trick question? 
If optioning lucas's screenplay 
Is just part of some grand scheme to get me back, You can forget it, all right? 
I am done lying to him about us. 
I'm sorry. 
Do you really think I would blow my reputation And a studio's multimillion-dollar investment 
To get you back? 
Peyton, I left you. 
And as far as lying to lucas, I never asked you to do that. 
Frankly, I really don't care if he knows about us. 
I didn't tell him out of respect for your engagement. 
In fact, I think I've handled the whole situation Like a professional. 
Now, if you don't mind, I think my date should probably be here any minute. 
Peyton... why did you lie to lucas? 
Because if it's a part of some grand scheme to get me back... 
I'd be curious. 
It's called supply and demand. 
No, it's called taking advantage, And it's not very nice. Sit down. 
What is this? 
A kickback 
It's yours to keep if you're in cahoots. 
I most certainly am not in cahoots. 
Didn't you learn anything from your pooky wooky book? 
Treating your friends well is more important than extorting them. 
What's extorting? 
I think you've learned enough economics for one day. 
I just want to buy daddy a slamball trophy. 
You're a sweet kid, Even if you are too smart for your own good sometimes. 
So we're in cahoots? 
No. no. we're not in cahoots. 
I'm gonna spank your little cahoot If you don't go out there And give all your friends their money back right now. 
One. two. three. Slashers! 
Let's go. 
Who are you looking for? 
Nobody. this scout, he was supposed to show up. 
I guess he couldn't make it. 
This whole time, I thought you were showing off for me. 
That's funny. I thought you were showing off for brooke. 
Looks like we were both showing off For people who don't care. 
What do you say we play these last five minutes For the people who do? 
You're on. 
The cemetery called. 
Apparently, somebody gave my tombstone a makeover. 
Any idea who'd do something like that? 
What happened in the hallway? 
I assume you mean... 
Keith. 
I've been asked to adapt my novel for a movie. 
They want me to write what happened. 
I can't do it. 
I can't see it. 
And I can't understand it. 
Keith was holding jimmy edwards in the hallway. 
He turned, and I shot him dead before he could say a word. 
Keith was a hero. 
You want to write the truth, you write it that way. 
Why'd you do it? 
Every good story needs a villain, lucas. 
I'm sorry, but I'm yours. 
I'm worried about daddy. 
Yeah, me too, buddy, but the game's almost over, okay? 
Do you know what I haven't had in my lap lately? 
It's not really a secret. 
A jamie scott. 
Sorry about teaching jamie how to make money off of his friends. 
I just wanted him to think I was cool. I... 
Didn't mean to get him in trouble. 
You know, jamie really looks up to you. 
You've got a great opportunity to be a role model to him. 
You just have to choose it, 
And that takes a commitment to making good choices for both of you. 
Just think about that next time. 
Sorry. 
Time-out! time-out! 
Owen, you're out. 
I'm fine! 
Owen, come on, man. listen, take a seat. 
Take a seat. I appreciate you being my guardian angel, 
But I can take it from here, all right? 
I got this. Me, you, 15 seconds and one basket, scott 
That sound familiar? 
Yeah, only one tiny difference. 
Unlike you, I won't choke. 
Ugh. daddy. 
Hey. I'm fine, see? 
I'm all right. 
Don't play slamball anymore, daddy. 
I liked it better when you were naked. 
I liked it better when you were a guy I thought I could count on. 
I'm sorry. I should've never let you bring me presents 
If I wasn't totally sure I saw a future with us. 
What do you see now? 
I see my foster child acting like a total idiot. 
I have my work cut out for me with that one. 
Brooke 
I'm crazy about you. 
And I think you are a truly great guy 
Just not your boyfriend. 
I didn't say that. 
It's just that right now, I have the opportunity to be a great role model for sam, 
And that means I have to put her first. 
I can respect that. 
What about down the road? 
For a guy like you... 
I might just come crawling back. 
I'll see ya. 
Playstation, pizza, pinball, pie 
My video game, fast food, arcade, and dessert preferences. 
I'll keep those in mind. 
I wrote it. 
Oh, you're not gonna regret it. I'm right about this, luke. you got to trust me. 
Hey, come in. come in. I got to take this. 
Bobby, yeah. yeah. 
The script is on its way, and you are going to love it. 
Yeah, he wrote the scene. 
Of course it's great. he's a great writer. 
Yeah, no, you've got nothing to worry about. 
I think I'm cashing in. 
Oh, come on. 
We've got everything we need to pull an all-nighter 
Food, coffee. 
We have beer... 
Had beer. 
Yeah, it sounds like fun, but I should get home. 
Don't. 
Gigi, I have a girlfriend. 
And she doesn't have to know. 
I'm not trying to be your girlfriend, mouth. 
I'm just trying to be the girl you pull a crazy all-nighter That nobody ever has to find out about with. 
Come on. I'm proud of you for this. 
You know, it's one thing to admit your mistakes, But it's another to make them right. 
What... is your grand plan? 
Let's jet. 
You can't do that! that's stealing! 
There is a security camera in here. 
- It's broken. - How do you know? 
Because I broke it. 
Sam 
Damn it. 
You're a good mom. you're a good mom. 
Hi, body. 
I'm in one piece. 
I was scared that you were gonna be like... 
Ah, come here. 
Listen to me. I'm never gonna be like that again, okay? 
None of this is worth losing my ability To hold my son when he's afraid... 
And my wife when she needs me. 
It's okay. I'm done with slamball. 
But the championship. 
I don't care about the championship. If these are the last two trophies I ever get, I will consider myself a lucky man. 
Good,' cause I gave all my profit back. 
What? 
Your son started a business today. 
Oh, yeah? 
how'd it go? 
Well, I broke even, and grandpa dan lost his shirt. 
What? grandpa dan lost his shirt? 
Luke, it's great. 
Julian was right. it needed that scene. 
What made you change your mind about writing it? 
Just realized it wasn't about a murder. 
It's about how your heart breaks... 
When your hero dies. 
I'm okay with the world seeing that. 
Okay, I need to tell you something, and... 
Does it involve this? 
So you dated... 
In l.a.? 
We were in love. 
Only time can teach us what is truth and what is legend. 
Some truths do not survive the ages. 
But the legend of the child with the blue eyes will live forever... and be whispered in all four... winds of the great white mountains. 
We, the Yagahl, were hunters of the mightiest of all beasts, the manak. 
But our world began to change. 
The manaks came later and later to our valley... and there were times when they did not come at all. 
Our hunters grew restless, and our people grew hungry. 
Only one amongst us, the one we called Old Mother, the last of her kind, only she could speak to the spirits of the earth... and ask the wisdom of the Fathers to save our people. 
Many times she asked. 
Until one night, they answered her call and sent us a sign. 
A sign of the beginning of the end. 
We found her in the mountains. 
The Fathers have sent her. 
She came to tell us... of four-legged demons that will put an end to our world. 
They will come to our valley at the time when... we go on our last hunt. 
But do not fear. 
From this hunt, a warrior will arise. 
And this one will be his woman. 
They will lead us into a new life... where the Yagahl will know hunger no more. 
That night, Old Mother did not see... the face of the warrior which spoke, but she knew that the child with the blue eyes... was a blessing that she must protect. 
To our people, she was Evolet, the promise of life. 
Only one of the Yagahl did not believe in Old Mother's prophecy : 
The young boy's father, the one who carried the White Spear... and blew the whistle for the hunt. 
I will watch over your son as if he were my own. 
I know you will. 
We cannot wait for the last hunt. 
Throw again. 
Good throw. 
Ka'Ren. 
Ka'Ren. 
No, not you. Your father abandoned our people. 
Go away. 
Leave him. Ka'Ren, I said, leave him. 
D'Leh... 
- He's the son of a coward. 
You never say that again. Any of you. 
You are alone. 
What happened to your people? 
They were killed. By four-legged demons. 
You will never be alone, Evolet. 
Do you see that light? 
That one? It does not move across the sky like all the others do. 
That light is like you, in my heart. 
It will never go away? No. 
Evolet, come here. Don't stray from the hut without telling me. 
And for many moons Evolet and D'Leh looked at each other, and the love in their hearts grew stronger. 
Until finally, after many years, the day of the last hunt arrived. 
D'Leh, how long do we have to keep watching? 
And when will they come? 
- I don't know. D'Leh, when will I become a hunter? 
When you stop asking so many questions. 
Great hunter Tic'Tic came to Old Mother's hut. 
She thinks the time of prophecy has come. 
She told him not to kill the manak this hunt. 
She thinks Ka'Ren will win the White Spear... and claim Evolet. 
Baku, look what I found for you. 
You know what a good hunter Ka'Ren is. 
We must run away. Together we can cross the Great Mountains. 
Abandon our people? 
Like my father? 
I cannot do that. 
I've waited for this so many moons. 
The only way to be together is, 
I must kill the manak. 
They are here. 
Look how many they are. 
Today, I will not pierce the heart of the manak. 
It will be one of you. 
One of you will claim the White Spear. 
May the Fathers of the Yagahr... and the spirit of the mighty manak... choose the best of you. 
Ka'Ren, you have the first throw. - Ka'Ren, the manak is yours. 
You will be our leader. 
D'Leh, what about you? 
I want to win Evolet. 
All together, at once. 
Tic'Tic found the lead bull. 
Slow down. D'Leh. 
They're breaking away. Hold him back. 
Baku, they are coming. 
They are coming. They are coming. 
They are... 
The last one is coming. It is a big bull. 
D'Leh is coming. Ka'Ren, make your throw. 
Keep him low. Hold him back. 
He's too strong. Let go, Ka'Ren. 
D'Leh, we have to let go. - I can't. My hand is caught. 
Look, look. It's D'Leh. 
You killed him. All alone. 
No one has ever done that. 
That was brave. 
D'Leh killed the manak. He did not let go of the net. 
He was the only one. 
What are you waiting for? 
Wise Spirit, I killed the manak. 
I claim the White Spear. 
And with it my woman. 
From that day on, D'Leh was no longer the son of a coward. 
Now the Yagahl would honor his name... for bringing to them the blessings of the manak for one last time. 
And though Old Mother was pleased in her heart... to see Evolet so happy, she feared in her soul that the... one who had slain the mighty beast... did not have the courage for what was to come. 
Why does Tic'Tic not celebrate with us? 
D'Leh? - There's something I must do. 
What do you want? 
I was not brave. And I did not hunt as one. 
The Fathers of the Yagahl played with us today. 
What should I do? If I give up the White Spear, I give up Evolet. 
Is she yours to give up? 
It is not the way of the Yagahl to claim the White Spear with a lie. 
I gave the White Spear back to Tic'Tic. Why would you do such a thing? 
I did not kill the manak, Evolet. Yes you did. You held on to the net. 
No, I lied. 
I tried to let go with all the others. 
Then the manak ran into my spear. 
I did nothing. 
Evolet, remember what I told you about our light? 
I still feel the same. 
You will always be in my heart. 
That will never go away. 
But still... you're giving me up. 
That night the great white rain came to the valley of the Yagahl. 
And like an icy rain, sadness fell over D'Leh's heart. 
And with the white rain came the four-legged demons. 
Stay here. 
Moha. 
Watch out. 
Baku, hide you. 
We cannot help them. 
Let me... 
Let me go. 
What are you doing? - I'm going after them. 
Over the Great Mountains? That is not possible. 
They came over the Great Mountains, did they not? 
They are demons. Maybe they can fly. I did not see wings on them, did you? 
You think you can bring a God down alone? Who are you? 
He is not alone. 
I go with him. 
Without the other hunters, we all will die. 
I will go too. No, Baku, you will stay here. 
But you, Ka'Ren, you must go with him. 
Don't touch me. 
And as they bade farewell to the... elders and the children of our people, the Wise Spirit of the Yagahl... blessed them and the spears by their sides. 
Old Mother knew they would never be hunters again... but warriors since then. 
It will be night, so we stay here. No, we go on. 
We are getting closer. 
I cannot see in the dark, can you? 
We stay here. 
We stay here, we eat and sleep. 
Why do you not carry the White Spear? 
Are you afraid? 
Answer. - Ka'Ren, go to sleep. 
Baku. What are you doing here? 
Go home. 
- I can help you. 
I can carry the water bag. 
- Go home. 
They killed my mother. 
He's alone. 
He will only slow us down. 
D'Leh, I'm thirsty. 
The fire still lives in these stones. 
She is alive. We must hurry. 
Why is Old Mother freezing? 
White rain is not a friend of the hunter. 
It swallowed all the marks of the stolen brothers and sisters. 
It was now to the Fathers of the Yagahl to guide their way. 
And they walked for many days and night to a faraway land... where the Great Mountains ended... and where the story of the child with the blue eyes began. 
The place where the four-legged demons killed Evolet's people. 
We've walked for days now. And still no marks. 
Maybe they do have wings. - Maybe they do. 
But our brothers and sisters do not. 
Don't forget to chew. 
Maybe she only lost it. 
It is hot here. - Baku, stay close. 
What was that? 
We must free them tonight. - Not tonight. 
This is not a good place. 
They know there is danger out there, and they keep a good watch. 
We do the same. 
I will go first, then Ka'Ren, then you. 
D'Leh. Come. 
I understand your pain. 
But you must be patient. 
D'Leh. 
This way. 
Go. 
D'Leh. 
Run. 
Over here. This way. 
Ka'Ren. 
Run. Run. 
Tic'Tic. Go. Tic'Tic. 
D'Leh, Evolet, up here. 
D'Leh. 
- I'll get the boy. 
No, do not go. 
I will come back for you. I promise. 
Baku. 
You should not be here. 
I think he speaks of D'Leh. 
He promised it to me. 
Ka'Ren, do you think he's still alive? Does not matter now. He tried to save us. 
I should have listened to you. 
Tonight, I'll bring you food. 
Old Mother was watching over their journey with all her strength... and her spirit stayed always by their side. 
But that night she could not rule over the forces of the earth... and could not stop the waters of the heavens. 
D'Leh would have to face alone the... mighty beast who rules these lands. 
Do not eat me when I set you free. 
I feared you were dead. - Do not fear for me. 
Look, over there. There was an attack. 
I heard them screaming. 
This is where they went. 
Tic'Tic, move away. Come. 
D'Leh, come back. 
Move away. 
You must remember me. I gave you life. 
Speak to the Spear Tooth? 
How do you come to speak our words? 
Do not like Naku food? 
We come from over the mountains. We know where you come from. How do you know? 
How do you come to speak our words? 
A man come from the mountain before. 
He was looking for a new land. 
Our wise man told me to learn his words. You, you have his face. 
He was taken a long time ago. 
Taken where? 
Come. 
When your father came to us, he became my friend. 
Then the evil spirits stole your father, like many of our people. 
They bring them to the nest of the great birds... and fly away over the sand. 
Where do they take them? 
To the Mountain of the Gods. 
No one has ever returned. 
Our wise man says you will lead us there. 
Me? 
We have a telling that... one day the one will come... who will free our people. 
The one who speaks to the Spear Tooth. 
And as the brave people of the Naku buried their dead, they sent word to all the tribes of the land... that the one who speaks to Spear Tooth had come. 
Their call was a call for war. 
Why do they think I can free their people? 
There's something you must know about your father. 
When your mother died bringing you life, 
your father took upon himself not only the weight of you, but all our people. 
We were starving. 
He could not wait for Old Mother's prophecy to come true. 
Your father did not run away. 
He left to save our people. 
How could you let me believe all this time... that my father betrayed us? 
Because he wanted you to be that way. 
Your father carried the White Spear. 
He feared that when he left, others would follow him... and abandon our people. 
And why do you tell me this now? 
A good man... draws a circle around himself and cares for those within. 
His woman, his children. 
Other men draw a larger circle and... bring within their brothers and sisters. 
Some men... have a great destiny. 
They must draw around themselves... a circle that encloses many, many more. 
Your father... was one of those men. 
You must decide for yourself... whether you are as well. 
This is Kawu, our fastest runner. 
He bring voice from the people who live that way. They stole many more men. 
And now they are moving to the great birds, fast. 
We must find them before they reach these birds. 
The day before you came, they took her life. 
And they stole our son. 
I am Baku. Tudu. 
- No, I am Baku. Baku, Tudu. 
Baku, Tudu. 
You must help. 
The word of the Naku traveled fast... and from all winds came many warriors. 
The TukTuk, who move like big running... birds and hide their eyes behind trees. 
And from the valley without sun came... the ones with blood on their heads. 
But the strongest of them all were the Huta. 
Their leader spoke for all the warriors of the land. 
Tell him if his people walk with us, we will bring them down. 
He says you are only a boy. 
Quina is a Hoda. 
Hoda do not laugh. 
They walked faster and faster and did not slow down to eat or to rest. And more spears joined them with each passing day. 
This word' yahala', what does it mean? 
They are your words : 
'We must bring them down.' 
The great birds have arrived. 
Baku, D'Leh's here. 
Him and her. 
Maybe the boy is right. 
D'Leh cannot fly over the water like they can. 
But who the fuck could fight so many spears? 
This river moves like a snake in the sun. 
He says the eye of the snake rest under the sun... and under the moon does not move. 
Is there a shorter way to the head of the snake? 
But no one can walk that far. 
The mountains and the sand, they all look the same. 
And we will lose our way. 
We will all day. 
And we will free our people. 
They had walked in circles for many days and lost their way. 
And the eye of the snake was nowhere to be found. 
Remember what the river people said? It rests under the sun, but under the moon it does not move. 
Nakudu, tell them what I said. 
It will guide us to the head of the snake. 
And as the last moon had come to the valley of the Yagahl, it seemed that all spirits had left Old Mother. 
She did not eat or speak for many moons... because she knew there was one last destiny to fulfill. 
Wise Spirit... It's me, Katan. 
How can a man do such a thing to a father manak? 
Some say they came from the stars. 
Others believe that they flew across the Great Water... when their land sank into the sea. 
They are even more. 
You think they will fight with us? 
That is for you to find out. 
I'll bring you home. Where is Evolet? 
The women sleep in different huts. 
Tic'Tic is waiting with many spears by the sand. 
He was sacrificed. 
It is my mistake that they are in this terrible mess. I need your forgiveness. 
The Fathers chose you to lead us. 
And we will stand by your side. 
Tell them how many spears we have. 
The number of spears does not matter. 
They have hidden him here ever since. Wise man.. 
Tell us more of these Gods. 
He said, once, only once he heard the God... speak of one he fears. 
They have a telling of one who wears the mark... that you can see in the sky at night. 
They call it Uruana,'the Mark of the Hunter'. The brightest star of all heaven. 
He asks if you wear the Mark of the Hunter. 
The man who saved his life. - Where is he? 
His bones are buried in the sand with all the others. 
He was my father. 
They will not fight with us. 
They have their own prophecy. 
A prophecy has many faces, many ways to come true. 
Your father, he gave this to me. No, great hunter, this is yours... 
Be as your father. 
Be as your father. 
I know how it feels to lose a good friend. 
Your father was mine. 
I barely remember him. He remembered you. 
His heart hurt when he spoke about... a boy beyond the Great Mountains. 
He was preparing to leave to go back to you. 
That is when he was taken. 
D'Leh, the men are waiting. 
He is great and we are small, and still we bring him down. 
Because we hunt together. As one. 
When the sun arises, we will join our brothers and... sisters on the Mountain of the God... and convince them to fight with us... together, as one. 
'Yahala.' 
We must go everybody up the ramp. Go, go. 
Ka'Ren. No. 
Like this traitor. 
Turn back to your mountains. 
Tell him I'll take his offer. 
Tell him. 
But I will take all my people with me. 
Each and every Yagahl. 
Tell him. 
No.. 
this was not what Old Mother had foretold. 
But just as she was lost to him forever, the legend of the child with the blue eyes began 
Your father wanted to bring these back to you. 
They will feed your people. 
Thank you, brother Nakudu. 
That was the last time they saw their friends the Naku. 
And as the ones who walked with the Fathers... looked down on them and guided their way, so the Yagahl looked to Evolet and D'Leh... to guide their people. 
And when the first moon was born again to their valley, it brought with it the first fruits of their land. 
Look how fast it is growing. 
And so it came to pass that the promise of life was fulfilled. 
A thousand years ago... 
A clan of weavers formed a secret society of assassins. 
They silently carried out executions to restore order to a world on the brink of chaos. 
They called themselves the fraternity. 
Six weeks ago... 
It's my anorexic boss' Birthday 
This means a certain amount of pressure to stand around a conference table eating crappy food and pretending to worship her. 
Acting for five minutes like Janis doesn't make all of our lives miserable is the hardest work I'll do all day. 
My job title is account manager. 
I use to be called an account service representative 
But a consultant told us we need to manage our clients and not service them. 
I have a girlfriend whom I neither manage nor service. 
That's my best friend Barry fucking her on an Ikea kitchen table that I picked up for a really good price. 
I'm finding it hard to care about anything these days 
In fact, the only thing I do care about is the fact that I can't care about anything. 
It seriously worries me? 
My name is Wesley Gibson. 
My dad walked out my mom when I was seven days old. 
Sometimes I wonder if he ever looked in my baby blue eyes and ask himself : 
Did I just father the most insignificant asshole of the 21st century? 
If you could consignments to me by the twenty-eighth 
Relax. 
If your name came up you'd be dead already. 
We had some unexpected losses recently. 
We'd like to know. Where our competitor is getting his ammunition. 
It's clean. 
Meaning? 
Meaning it's untraceable. Your competitor is very smart 
Get down! 
No one leaves the fraternity, Cross. 
I have a new prospective on a fraternity. 
Careful. You don't destroy something that's been around for a 1000 years. 
It's already destroyed. 
He broke the code. 
I have to stop this. 
Really? 
You know this. 
So why you don't face me yourself? 
Never send a sheep to kill a wolf. 
They were just a decoys. 
Good bye, Mister X. 
Never send a sheep to kill a wolf. 
They were just a decoys. 
Wesley! What is it? 
What do you mean what is it? 
Listen! 
How hell am I supposed to sleep through this fucking racket? 
When are we going to move so we don't have to wake up at that shit? 
I kind of like it. 
It helps to drain out the sound of your annoying fucking voice. 
Now please let me sleep. 
Have you even thought about our talk? Yeah. 
Which one? 
Perfect. That's perfect. 
Feed Annabelle. 
Oh my fucking god! 
I hope that's not my billing report sitting on your desk. 
Holly shit on an alter it is. 
I want that report on my desk in one hour. 
Okay everybody. 
We're all delayed for a hour. 
Want to hear something sad? I need an ergonomic keyboard to keep my repetitive stress injury in check. 
Just a fact that I repeat something enough that causes me stress is fucking sad. 
Nice job dude. 
Have you seen Barry? 
He had to go to the dentist. 
Yes! Ah! 
Barry! Ahhh! 
Do you think, they have that morning after pill here? 
This thing works, you crush it up in her omelet. " Hey baby, breakfast in bed". 
Oh, god! 
I lost my wallet somewhere. 
All this together? 
No... no... 
Yes. 
He is the man. 
Which is it? 
Oh, plus this. 
$ 20.42 
Watermelon. 
Chicks dig it. 
Thanks. 
See you next time. 
Have a good time. I love these energy drinks, man. 
I'm almost on kind of like an energy drink cleans. 
One for breakfast, then two or three for a lunch... I am the man. 
Yeah, right, Barry, I am the man. 
in fact, I'm so much the man I have a standing prescription for medication to control my anxiety attacks. 
God, I wish I had something else to relieve my stress! 
Hello, Wesley! 
You know, there are people. 
Beautiful people. 
You just wish they could see you in a different setting, a different place. Instead of where you are, what you've become. 
Nicole is so hot! 
What? 
Boom now's the time lad! 
But most of you wish you weren't such a pussy for wishing for things that are never change. 
Good god of mine! 
You're over here like in spring fucking breaking and I still don't have that billing report. 
Why would you to keep you around, Wesley? 
I'll get done, Janice. 
Oh, like I've never heard that before. 
I'll get it done I'll get in done, Janice. 
I am sorry! 
Fuck that sorry, I don't need sorry, I've hired you to get things done. 
You know what the best thing is about the end of a day? 
Tomorrow it starts all over again.

Hi. 
I am sorry? 
You apologize too much. 
Sorry about that. 
I knew your father. 
My father left the week I was born, so... 
Your father died yesterday on the roof top of the Metropolitan building. 
Sorry. 
Look, the liquor is around just over there, so... 
Your father was one of the great assassins who ever lived. 
The man who killed him is behind you. 
Sorry. 
Oh, Oh my god! Oh my god! 
What the fuck just happened? Shit! 
Pleas, Please drive faster! 
Please be quiet. 
Please drive faster! 
Quiet. Please, understand that I care about my life! 
I don't know what the fuck you did to piss this guy off, but can you let me out and call the cops? 
Ah! 
What are you doing? 
I think we lost him. 
I think we lost him. could you let me out at the next corner please. 
Oh! 
Wow! Shit! 
Oh, shit. 
He is right there! 
Look I'm an accountant, just an accountant. 
He's fucking persistent, you know? 
What the fuck? 
You kick his ass! 
You got to shoot him! 
What are you doing? What are you shooting the car for? 
Are you crazy? 
Grab the wheel. Oh, shit! 
Where are you going? 
You, get... Get back right here!

Look out! Look out! 
Oh my god! 
I am sorry! 
Shit! 
Hello! 
I have... 
I don't have any money. 
I thought he'd be taller. 
Taller? 
Sir... sir, I've been try to explain that lady here I'm an accountant... 
I'm income service representative, I'm an account manager... and... and.. 
I'm sure that if you would call my boss Janice she'd fill you in on whatever... went wrong you can contact her by email... she... 
Shoot the wings off the flies. 
I don't know what that means. 
Shoot the wings off the flies. 
I really think you have me mixed up with somebody else... 
On three. 
Either you shoot or I do. 
One. 
Okay. 
Two. 
I can't even see them! 
Three. 
It's impossible. 
A lot of things for you were impossible before today. 
What you experienced Wesley was not a panic attach. 
Your heart was beating in excess of 400 beats per minute. 
Sending abundant amounts of adrenaline into your blood stream. 
This allows you to see and react faster than normal. 
Only a few people in the world can do that. 
Your father could do it. 
And you can do it. 
With a little work you will find how to control these attacks. 
Stay away from me. 
You stay back from me. 
I have a gun sir. 
All right? 
My name is Sloan. 
This is Fox. 
And the others you see around you are all very good at killing. 
So if I were you, I'd keep your gun pointed at me, you don't want it pointed at any of them. 
That's better. 
You're insane. 
No. 
Insanity is wasting your life for nothing when you have a blood of a killer flowing in veins. 
Insanity is being shit on, beat down. 
Coasting through life in a miserable existence when you have a caged lion locked inside you and the key to release it. 
This gun you holding is an Imanishi-17, it belonged to your father. 
He could conduct a symphony orchestra with it. 
And you going to use it and to kill that man who shot him down and cold blood. 
The same man who tried to kill you tonight. 
Your father was one of us. 
A fraternity of assassins. 
The weapons of fate. 
We've transferred all his savings over to you. 
And let me assure you they are substantial... 
It is your long awaited destiny. 
To join us. 
Back off. Back off. 
You don't know anything about me. 
Stay away from me. Stay away from me! 
Would you stay away from me? 
Would you stay away from me, please? 
You let me through? 
You know, when you have a dream... 
And you're half awake. 
But it still in a fringe of your brain. 
Then you open your eyes and you're so damn glad it was a dream? 
This was nothing like that. 
Could you just give me One second, thank you.

What's up with you? 
What do you mean? 
Ah, you... you're here early. 
Is that... 
Is that... you seem pepped up. You're all right? 
Oh yeah. 
Yeah. 
I guess I feel... kind of different. 
Whatever. 
I'm going to get some posits notes... you want one? 
No. 
Really? 
Yeah. 
Okay. 
Jesus-H fucking popsicle! 
I still don't have my billing reports. 
But you have time to sit here and google your ass off... 
Well I know one thing. You got your review coming up next week. 
And I can't wait to start checking me off some big fucking boxes. 
Attitude : poor. 
Performance : poor. 
Management skills : poor. 
Works well with others? 
Ha, that's a fucking joke. 
What is this bullshit? 
Who is this prick? 
Some looser gets his head blown off on the roof top of Metropolitan... 
Shut the fuck up! 
She has one single iota of tenuous power. 
She thinks she can push everyone around? 
You don't need this. 
I understand. 
Junior high must have been kind of tough. 
But it doesn't give you the right to threat your coworkers as a horse shit, Janice. 
I know, we laugh at you, Janice. 
We all know you keep a stash of jelly doughnuts in the top of your desk. 
But I want you to know... 
If you weren't such a bitch we'd feel sorry for you. 
I do feel sorry for you. 
But as it's stands, the way you behave... 
I feel like I can speak for the entire office... when I tell you... 
Go fuck yourself. 
Yeah. 
That was great, bro! Who's the man? 
I'm the man. 
Hi! 
Yeah! 
It's... 
Couldn't find your keys, huh? 
That could be handy, you going to teach me that? 
I'd might need that. 
So Fox, right? 
What's that? Is that a call sign? 
Like Maverick, Top gun? 
You could tell me, but you'd got to kill me? 
I'm just kidding. 
Check and control rotation on this STB, should be three hundred per minute. 
This kind of weave the opposing thread should to be 4000. 
Hey you! 
This is pretty awesome. 
Is it a front? 
Front for what? 
I don't know. 
Assassination? 
You may think this is the front for something. 
All I can tell you, this is a textile mill. 
George, George! 
Go help Peter up there. 
This is textile mill. And a damn good one. 
Yeah, that's cute. But that's bullshit, right? 
I mean all these guys are killers, aren't they? 
I think you own me some answers... 
All right, clearly I don't understand, but... 
Do you make sweaters, or do you kill people? 
that's an awful lot of questions over coffee? 
Are you sure you're ready for the answers? 
Yes, I'm sure. 
Yeah, I can't go back. 
Not to my life. 
He's all yours. 
We're up. 
How are you doing? 
I'm the Repairman. 
What do you repair? 
A lifetime of bad habits. 
Ok. 
Would you do me a favor? 
Just put your arms behind your back. 
Ah, it's okay. 
I don't know... 
Just put on your back. 
Is this okay? 
Just relax. 
Is this part of it? 
there we go. 
Are you going to put bag over my head? 
No. 
There's no need for a bag. 
It's not too tight, is it? 
No, that's... nice. 
Why did you come here, Wesley? 
Well you brought me here, you remember? 
What the fuck you do that for? 
How many punches did the Repairman throw before he was counting sheep? 
you know, I haven't spend a lot of time having my face smashed down before, all right? 
you spend lot of time with knives? 
Breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
It was a rhetorical question, Uno. 
You interrupt me again, I use the business end 
Here is what you need to know, puto, Knives are easy to hide. 
They don't jam and they never run out of bullets. 
They come in handy... 
when you got to do some close contact work. 
What the fuck? 
Come in. 
Come in! 
you try to cut me. 
What? 
Try to cut me. 
Hey, just... stick me here. 
Be careful with that, it's sharp! 
Just stick, and... stick, and... 
Why? 
Seriously, then I can hurt you! 
Okay. 
Pussy. 
I'm not a pussy. 
You are pussy. 
No, I'm not a pussy. 
You pussy. 
I'm not a pussy, I got to healthy respect for the human condition. 
Fuck that, you're pussy! 
I'm not a pussy! 
You pussy! 
I'm not a pussy. 
- Come on, pussy! 
- I'm not a fucking pussy! 
Hi. 
How are you doing? 
Fuck! 
- Just a moment. - Just a moment. 
Sorry. 
Hey, hey, come back, hey! 
You must drink. Drink yeah. 
What is this? 
This bath stimulates white blood cells and speed up the process. 
if you have bruises, cuts, breaks heal in hours, not days. 
Are you shitting me? 
What is this, Vodka? 
Yeah. 
Are you Russian? 
Yeah. 
Get up. 
This is the gunsmith. 
He knows more about a piece than anybody and he's going to teach you how to use one. 
How are you doing? 
Pretty good. 
You know, Richard broke his leg. 
Oh, really? 
Yeah. 
In a three places. 
How did he do it? 
Jumped off a building. 
Is he going to be ok? Yeah. pretty bad though. 
Oh my god. 
Oh my god, you guys did it so realistic. 
He's been in a recovery like for three days, and they say they not even going to let him out. 
Oh my god. 
oh my GOD! 
Hey, we can't shoot in a dead woman! 
She might be somebody's mom! 
You need to know what is it like to put a bullet in a body. 
Why are you here? 
You know, I... 
I thought I was learning to be some kind of super-assassin. 
You know, If I wanted to get beat up I would have stayed in my cubicle, you know? 
Fuck. 
All right, shoot the target. 
From there. 
You want me shoot through Wilbur? 
No, I want you to curve the bullet. 
How am I supposed to do that? 
It's not a question of" how". 
It's a question of" what". 
If no one told you that bullets flew straight. 
And I'd gave you a gun and told you to hit the target, what would you do? 
Let your instincts guide you. 
How the hell did you do that? 
Can you do that? 
You do that. 
Hey, I think that's a real train it is. 
fucking asshole! 
Come on! 
lets go! 
Are you out of your fucking mind? 
Oh god, I feel... 
I feel... 
I feel... 
I feel kind of good. 
He got Rictors. 
Perfect shot. 
Impossible angle. 
Cross is taking us out one by one. 
Wesley is the only one who can get to him. 
Cross gets closer with each hour. 
Get back to work. 
Do you see that? 
it's a shuttle. 
I want you to try to catch it. 
You want me to stick my hand in there? 
Yes. I want you to catch it. 
you want to put a gun to my head? 
I can slow things down like with the fly. 
You need to learn to control that by yourself. 
This is bullshit! 
How is it going today, Wesley? 
You know... 
Fuck the loom, fuck the Repairman. 
I can shoot the wings off the back of the fly! 
I'm ready! 
You will ready when Fox says you ready. 
Who puts her in charge? 
I did. 
Wesley. 
People think you use cheese to catch this beauties. 
But they go ape shit for peanut butter. 
Your farther was a big fan of this. 
Watch! 
Right... 
Plastic explosive of peanut butter. 
Sorry, Mickey. 
Five... four... three... two... one... 
Hey. 
Hey, Russian! 
Good for that one. 
Imagine if you had a thousand? 
they really fucked you didn't they? 
What the hell did they do to you? 
Threw you in front of a moving train for no reason? 
Beat the shit out of you? 
You know, you can say it this place is bullshit. 
This is bullshit, ha? 
Bullshit? 
Repairman in five minutes. 
Heads... out of a question. 
Fuck. 
You are wasting my fucking time. 
Why are you here? 
I don't know, so hit me. 
Why are you here? 
I had a shit life, so why wouldn't I? 
I want to kick your fucking ass! 
What do you want me to say? 
Why are you here? 
I don't know! 
why are you here? Why are you here? 
I don't know why I'm here. 
Why are you here? 
What did you say? 
I said I don't know who I am. 
Do you really want to know who you are? 
Yeah, It's my room. 
No. 
This was your father's room. 
What happened? 
A member of this fraternity went rogue. 
Cross... 
He started by killing the one man who was better than him. 
Your father. 
Blind sided him... on a roof top. 
Betrayed him. 
Everything in this room books, weapons, clothes belonged to him. 
Now they belong to you. 
Find a connection in this room, Wesley. 
Maybe the only way of finding out, who you are. 
Now I know why I could never care about anything before this. 
I was living a lie. 
Finally I have a chance to step into my father's shoes. 
Grow a pair. 
Live the life I was born to live. 
I've been pissing it all the way like it was another fucking billing report. 
I've to train harder. 
I have to be as good as my father. 
On these shelves, Wesley, are the records of the fraternity kills. 
Everything you will need to kill your target. 
To kill Cross, the man, who betrayed fraternity and murdered my father 
I must prepare. 
I have to become his student. 
Memorize every move he ever made. 
Every attack he ever executed. 
When he dropped a patient in an air tight room surrounded by secret service agents. 
And he took out that business man in the elevator. 
His bullets untraceable of course. 
but no matter what the weapon and how he eliminates his target. 
He was always one chess move ahead. 
One move more prepared. 
One step quicker. 
One shot more precise. 
In fact in all my research I've found he never missed a target. 
Not until me. 
Yeah! 
After today, you will never set foot in here again. Why not? Because you're like an apostle. 
Every culture in history has a secret code, one you won't find in traditional texts. 
They called themselves the fraternity. I'll be honest with you, all I see here are threads. 
Come here. 
Look there. 
Do you see that blind thread that missed the weave and lies on top of the others? Like a mistake? No, it's a code. 
- If the vertical thread is on top 
- It's a one. If it's below - it's a zero. 
Binary code? What is it say? 
It's a name. A target. 
Where that names come from? 
from out of a necessity, Wesley. 
Necessity to maintain balance in a world. 
They are orders and must be executed. 
Entrusted to us, so that we might forge stability of chaos. 
This one is yours. 
Look, I thought you brought me here to kill Cross. 
You will. 
In a time. 
This is your first assignment. 
The loom provides, I interpret, you deliver. 
You want me to kill Robert Dean Darden? 
Not me. Fate. 
The target will be in the conference room, sitting at the head chair. 
There are six windows. 
You will shoot through the fifth. 
Fifth window. 
What did he do if he deserved to die? 
I don't know he was bad, I don't know he was evil. 
I don't know if I can do that. 
About 20 years ago. 
There was this girl. 
Her dad was a federal judge. 
And so she probably had in her mind that she was going to follow in his footsteps. 
So she's home one Christmas. 
One they can buy off. So they hire this guy... Max Petridge. 
Get him to pay her father a visit. 
And a way he pays people a visit... 
And force them to watch, while he burns his targets alive. 
And then he takes a wire hanger and twists it around... 
And brands his initials at each one of them so they will never ever forget. 
After I was recruited into the fraternity 
I found out that Max Petridge's is name that come up. Weeks before the federal judge was killed. 
We don't know how far the ripples of our decisions go... 
Kill one, and maybe save a thousand. 
That's the code of the fraternity. That's what we believe in. 
And that's why we do it. 
Hey, where have you been, I have really missed you, man. Look at the big man! 
Barry, he pleases me in ways that you've never even heard of! 
Who the hell is she, Wesley? Your new whore? 
Is that what it takes now, you're paying for it? 
You, fuck! 
Freeze! 
Look, I know this... 
I... this is what you've trained me for? 
You can't go alone. I go alone or he doesn't show. 
He's not stupid. 
a member of the fraternity is dead because of me. 
Okay. 
Go. 
Thank you. 
I don't think that's a good idea. 
Your next assignment. 
And I know you made it so tell me where it is. 
Look at my finger. 
I... can try to arrange a meet. 
Have you ever thought about doing things differently? 
What do you mean? 
I don't know. 
Being... somebody else... 
Wesley... 
Is that true? 
It is me. 
And I killed him. To your father... protecting you was worth giving up his life. 
When Cross left the Fraternity, Sloan hunted you down. 
Ever since Fox had her teeth in you he's been trying to separate you from them. 
Your father never wanted you in the Fraternity, Wesley. 
He wanted a different path for you. 
With things that he could never have. 
A home, peace. No. He hoped you would find your own way. 
Your father got a hold of this. Decipher it yourself. 
Sloan began manufacturing targets on his own for profit years ago. 
Your father found out all about it. 
And he was going to do something about it on his own, right? But Sloan turned everyone against him. 
Holding onto the code made him a target. 
Yes. 
You want me to run? 
No. 
I want you to live. 
You can have a different life, Wesley. 
Like your father wanted for you. 
I say kill them all and let fate sort out the mess. 
This got Sloan's name on it. What did you say to me? 
I don't want this person dead. 
Fate wanted you dead. 
So he started manufacturing his own targets. 
For his own gains. And that's my dad found that. 
And that's when you sent a man's son to kill his father. 
You're not an assassin of fate Sloan. 
You're just a thug who can bend bullets. 
Is that true? 
Here is what the truth is. 
Your name came up. 
Your name. 
I saved your lives. Now look where we are. 
We are stronger than ever. 
Changing a course of history as we see it. 
Choosing the targets we select. 
We can redistribute power were we see fit. The wolves rule. 
Not the sheep. 
Now if any of you feel the need to follow the code of the fraternity to the letter. 
I invite you to take your gun, put it in your mouth, and pull the trigger. 
That is what Wesley demands. 
Otherwise. Shoot this motherfucker. 
and let us take our fraternity of assassins to heights reserved only for the gods of men. 
You choose. 
Fuck the code. 
who am I now? Account manager? 
I am none of these. Who am I now? 
This is not me, fulfilling my destiny. 
Still trying to figure out who you are? This is not me. 
This is just a motherfucking decoy. 
From the fraternity. From Janice. From billing reports. 
From ergonomic keyboards. 
From cheating girlfriends and sack-a-shit best friends. 
This is me taking back control of my life. What the fuck have you done lately? 
edit / ResYncH By ~ | ~ N3krA ~ | ~ SEPTiCEMiA - [ GMTeam ] 
I'm going to tell you a story now. 
But as any good storyteller knows, one must first be sure the audience is prepared. 
Is everybody comfortably seated? 
Does anyone need to use the bathroom? Oh. 
You, sir, in the back? 
Well, hold it in. 
You ready? 
Here we go. 
My name is Marty Bronson. 
I owned and operated the Sunny Vista Motel, which I established on the corner of Sunset and La Cienega Boulevards in Los Angeles, California, in the year 1974. 
The motel was my labor of love, and I ran it with the help of my children : 
Wendy, the key, please, for Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. 
Thank you. 
And Skeeter. 
May I help you with your bags, Mr. and Mrs. Dixon? 
- Yes, please. 
- Why, thank you, young man. 
You, uh, need a hand? 
No, no. I got it. 
To my boy Skeeter, the motel was a wonderland. 
Way too hyper. 
The galaxy's not big enough for the both of us. 
A magical place. 
Full of new adventures for a six-year-old boy. 
Oh, Skeeter. 
Come here. 
Skeeter loved the old place as much as I did. 
And he always tried to come up with ways to make it even better. 
I've got a lot of ideas how to improve things around here. 
I was thinking we could put an extra pair of socks in each room because people always forget to pack enough socks when they go on a trip. 
That's a good idea. 
Time for bed, I'm meeting with Mr. Nottingham. 
Wait, Dad. 
I'm not even tired. 
Well, how about a bedtime story? 
Now, once upon a time, there was a little boy, and that little boy's name was Skeeter. 
Well, I could tell a pretty fair tale when the muse was with me. 
And making my little boy smile, now, that was truly magical. 
Yeah, I was a pretty good dad and a pretty good host. 
But unfortunately, a pretty bad businessman. 
Can't you read the writing on the wall, Bronson? 
This motel is sinking in red ink... and I'm offering you the last lifeboat. 
I don't know. 
I've seen the books, Martin. 
If you don't sell to me, you're going to go bankrupt. 
Yes, well, I... 
I'd always hoped this place would be a home for my children. 
How about this? 
If your boy works hard and shows some smarts when he grows up, 
I'll let him run this place. 
You promise? 
Yes. 
Now sign the bloody papers. 
That's my boy, Bronson. 
Trust me, I'm going to turn this place into the finest hotel in Los Angeles. 
It's going to be uptight and out of sight. 
And just like that, our modest little Sunny Vista Motel... metamorphosized into the mighty Sunny Vista Nottingham. 
And for the past 25 years, it has been lovingly maintained by my now grown-up son, 
Skeeter Bronson, the handyman. 
Yes, though Mr. Nottingham's promise for Skeeter to run the place 
- seems to have been forgotten... 
- Hiya, Pop. 
my boy always works diligently with a hopeful heart, still waiting for his shot. 
Mrs. Dixon? 
Is there a problem with her room? 
Nothing you should bother your tiny mind about. 
Mrs. Dixon has been taking the nip bottles of liquor out of her mini-bar, and doesn't want to pay for it. 
I never even touched that evil little refrigerator. 
I don't drink alcohol. 
Of course. 
There's probably a mix-up. 
- I saw who took it. - OK. 
He had red hair and a beard. 
He was wearing a green suit with brass buttons. 
And he stands about ten inches tall. 
So we're talking about a leprechaun? 
There you go. 
Oh, I didn't know your brother was in town. 
So, um, here's what I think we should do. 
Put all the missing bottles on my tab. 
Next time you see any leprechauns, we'll tell Aspen. 
She's half-troll. 
I think, trolls eat leprechauns, am I right? 
She would. 
Today magic is in the air at the grand hotel, and the winds of change are about to blow our story in a strange new direction. 
But what would you expect in a hotel founded by someone who loved a good story as much as I? 
Time is of the essence here, Skeeter. 
Oh, yeah, I know. 
I just don't want the big boss man to get electrocuted. 
Of course. 
- You fixed it? 
- Let me see here. 
Yo, yo. Check, check. 
One, two. 
Come on. 
Hear me in the back? - Whoa, whoa. 
- Skeeter. 
I say" Barry," you say" Nottingham." - Barry. 
- Nottingham. 
- Barry. 
- Nottingham. 
Come on, give it up for the big man. 
Got them warmed up for you, sir. 
- It's good to see you again. 
- Germs. - Germs? 
- Uh, Skeeter, Mr. Nottingham has developed a fear, uh... 
Not a fear, an awareness... of germs and how dangerous they can be when not properly... 
feared, so... 
You're doing the right thing. 
I didn't shower today. 
So, yeah, let me get out of here. 
Barry Nottingham, everybody. 
- He's brilliant, him. 
I love this guy. 
- Welcome. 
As you know, I own 23 hotels from Berlin to Beijing. 
But it's no secret that this one, the Sunny Vista Nottingham, is my favorite. 
However, this is a 20th-century hotel. 
We need something for the 21st century. 
And so, we have decided to close this hotel and to build a brand-new Sunny Vista Mega Nottingham. 
This will be the largest hotel on the West Coast. 
I simply don't understand what the fuss is about. 
It's just a big building. 
Oh, no, no. 
This is like the future of the hotel business. 
and a top-secret theme that will blow your mind. 
Yes! 
So I'm proud to announce the new hotel's general manager. 
He's been waiting on this for a long time. 
We all know how hard he works, how intelligent he is, how much this hotel means to him. 
Take a bow, Mr. Kendall Duncan! 
Take a bow, Kendall. 
- God bless. 
- Boo! 
A beautiful speech, sir. 
A beautiful speech. 
I'm so glad you could come. 
It's great to see you. 
Don't touch me. 
Well done, Daddy. 
Oh, oh, hello there. 
Do you know my daughter, Violet? 
Only by reputation, sir. 
Excuse me? 
No, no, not that she has a reputation. 
I always heard she's very hot. 
Not hot as in hot. 
Hot, I meant warm... Warm-hearted. 
And she likes to go out and have fun, festive times, in bars, with a lot of different guys, and... 
That's the old Violet Nottingham, my friend. 
Before she met me. 
Now it's up to me to keep my pooky-bear out of the spotlight and nightclubs and tabloids. 
Isn't that right, sir? 
Violet's off to her private tennis lesson with Roger Federer. 
- Oh. All right, good for you. 
- Bye, boys. 
Got to say, uh... it's gonna be hard for me to, uh, see the hotel move locations like this. 
Well, I, I do hope you'll feel able to come and work with us there. 
Big as Kendall wants to make it, well, there's going to be a lot of light bulbs to change. 
Someone touched me. Is there any sanitizer? 
There is, sir. Come this way. 
I'll get you some. 
Please. 
Can't be too careful, Kendall. 
All right, everyone finished at the pottery table, bring their art to the kiln. 
The man with the rescue donkey's leaving in five minutes, if you haven't gotten a ride, hurry up. 
Thank you, Principal Duva. 
Oh, I'm not a principal at this party. 
I'm a mom. 
I notice no one's eating the gluten-free wheatgrass cake. 
Come on. 
Trust me, you just got to get past the smell. 
What? 
The clown died? 
- What's in that bag? 
- Oh, chocolate chip cookie. 
- Food! 
- Food! 
- Slow it down, slow it down. 
- Hey, sissy. 
Why do you bring sugary, chemical-filled crud to my house every time you visit? What? Every time I visit? 
You haven't invited me here in four years. 
What are you talking about? 
It hasn't been four years. 
You were here for The Fourth of July barbecue when you punched my husband? Yes. 
That was four years ago. 
I wanted to give him a wedgie, but his underwear had holes in it. 
I knew he'd be your ex-husband. You should be happy. 
All right. Let's not start. 
How are the kids handling the old divorce anyways? 
They're both kind of off right now. 
Bobbi's been really quiet. 
Why don't you go say hi. 
I'm gonna pay the donkey guy. 
- Is that what stinks in here? 
- No, it's the cake. 
What did she make, donkey cake? 
I smell manure. 
Hey, you guys. 
Remember me? 
Uncle Skeeter. 
Man, you got big. 
Haven't seen you in a while. 
Happy birthday there, Bobbi. 
I'm Patrick. 
She's Bobbi. 
Oh, my bad. 
Got you a little something. 
Happy birthday, Bobbi. 
Here you go. 
Picked it up at the hotel. 
How's school going? 
- Skeeter? 
- Yeah. 
Getting called to the principal's office. Look at that. 
Have fun with the gifts. 
And... 
Yes, yes. 
Shampoo? 
And a soap? 
Hanger and a towel. 
Do not talk about school with them. 
What's going on with the school? 
- They're closing it down. 
- No. 
- I'm getting laid off. 
- You? 
You're like the classic school principal. 
I mean, you're, you're scary and bad with people. 
Children are nervous around you. 
That doesn't sound right, but, I'm just saying, what else could you do? 
Besides, maybe, Cuban dictator? 
Or the bogeyman. 
You could be the bogeyman. 
- Anyway... - What, what? 
I've got some interviews set up in Arizona, which is kind of what I wanted to talk to you about. 
Uh-oh. 
I need you to watch the kids... 
for a week. No! 
No, they don't even like me! 
It's not going to be difficult, Skeeter. 
My friend Jill is a teacher at my school. 
She'll bring the kids in with her and watch them till dinnertime. 
All you gotta do is the night shift. 
Why can't your stupid friend do that? 
She's got night school. 
Skeeter! 
My husband left me. 
I'm getting laid off. 
I, I have to move. 
I need your help. 
So you need me. 
This is good. 
I'll do it. 
But you got to say, 
" Skeeter is the coolest. 
I am a nerd." 
" Skeeter's the coolest. I'm a nerd?" 
Yeah, you are! 
OK. Hey, you guys. 
I'm going to hang out with you this week. 
All right? 
Maybe we can go... fishing. 
I'd rather you didn't. 
Patrick's not a strong swimmer. 
OK, we'll stay inside. 
How about, uh, we play some poker? 
- I can teach you that. 
- Gambling? I don't think so. 
OK, how about we just take walks in the park 
- and catalog plant species? - Now you're talking. 
I don't know anything about plants except you try to make cakes out of them! 
He liked that one. I'm gonna end with a laugh. 
Give me some. 
Huh? 
I wasn't gonna hit you. 
I was trying to do the fist thing. 
You don't know the fist thing? 
OK, I was just... 
That's what, uh, the children do. 
Oh, this your truck, chief? 
Yes, it is, ma'am. 
You realize you're taking up two parking spaces? 
It's a big truck, ma'am. 
It's not that big, sir. 
You could fit into one spot. 
I had to park all the way down the block. 
Oh. Well, next time park in that box. 
Plenty of room in there. 
Anyway, here's the situation. 
This is not really my truck, this is the hotel I work for's truck. 
So if I get a scratch on it, they take it out of my salary. 
So two parking spaces provides me with what I call 
" a cushion of protection." 
Wait, a hotel? Oh, wait. You're Wendy's brother. 
- Yeah. 
- I'm Jill. 
- Who's that? 
- I'm her friend, the one helping take care of the kids next. 
I'm the day shift. OK, June. 
You plan on being this hostile the whole time? 
Jill. My name is Jill. 
Do you plan on keeping that haircut the rest of the time? 
Oh, haven't you heard? 
Goofy's the new handsome. 
- That sounds good for the environment. 
- Oh, we can't all have Priuses. 
How do you know I drive a Prius? 
Your whole aura reads Prius. 
Anyways, you're in my cushion of protection right now. 
I want to back up, so if you could just zing-zang up there, 
- that would be helpful. 
You might want some Cinnabons. You'll need it. 
Food! 
Give it back! 
Somebody owes me six bucks! 
So why didn't you demand that he make you the big boss of the new hotel? 
He promised your dad. 
I wanted to. It just wasn't the right time. 
Let me tell you how it works. The big man's giving the job to Kendall because he's dating his daughter. 
That's the way it works, keep it in the family. 
He gets the girl, he gets the job, he gets everything. 
And I get nothing. 
- Hello? 
- Where are you? 
Still there? 
I'm still where? Who's this? 
Look, I've got to get to class. 
The kids are waiting for you, OK? Oh! 
Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry. 
I forgot. I'll be there in like 20 minutes. 
I'm gonna baby-sit my nephew and niece tonight. 
Oh, God. Got any advice for me? 
Yes, I do. 
Sometimes I baby-sit my cousins, right? 
And what I do is I let them style me hair. 
Like put beads into it and braid it, make me look all real sexy. 
Like Milli Vanilli, stuff like that. 
You should try that. Braid my hair? 
That's a good idea. 
Can I have some French fries? 
Of course you can. 
You're my best friend. 
Ah! Actually, I really like ketchup on my face because it's rejuvenating for the skin. 
So who's the real victim? You are. Mmm! 
Delicious. 
Do you think these signs will help? 
Well, miracles happen, you know? 
You mean like Dad coming back? 
Sorry I'm late. 
So, um, their pajamas are on their beds, and I will be back, um, at 8 : 30 to pick them up, OK? 
- All right. 
- Here is my cell phone number. 
And call me if there's any emergencies. 
All right. 
Have fun at night school. 
- Bye, guys. 
- Bye. 
All packed up here. 
I got my, uh, toothbrush and, uh, and the toothpaste. 
Some clean underwear. 
Well, maybe not that clean. 
You guys want to watch TV? 
We don't have a TV. 
- Hello? 
- Emergency! 
They don't have a TV. 
Wendy doesn't let them watch TV. 
You didn't know? 
I don't know a lot of things about these kids. 
I wasn't allowed over here. 
Their old man didn't like me. 
OK, listen, you don't need a TV. 
You can, um, play a game, do a puzzle. 
I'm sure you can figure something out. OK? 
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Should I let them braid my hair or something? 
Would they like that? 
I don't think anyone should touch that hair. 
Hey, what do you say we go... next door and toilet paper your neighbor's trees? 
No? 
OK, bedtime! 
OK, so you guys cool? 
You have to read us a bedtime story. 
Yeah, all right. 
You have any? 
What do you got here, anyways? 
" Rainbow Alligator Saves the Wetlands"? 
Mmm, no. 
" The Organic Squirrel Gets a Bike Helmet"? 
I'm not reading these communist books to you guys. 
Don't you got any real stories? 
- Like what? - Like what? 
Like, like cowboys? 
Or dragons? 
Or aliens? Or... 
What the heck is on my head right now? 
That's Bugsy, our guinea pig. 
- Why do you call him Bugsy? 
- Because of his eyes. 
Let me see them. 
Wow! 
Those eyes would be big on a cow. 
Are those eyeballs or bowling balls? 
Can't keep my eyes off of them. 
Just get in there so I don't have to look at them anymore. 
Goodbye. 
Anyways, uh, you guys want me to, uh, make up a story for you? 
Like, like my old man used to do for me? 
Maybe I could be good at this. 
All right, um... 
Here goes. 
Once upon a time, in a magical, faraway kingdom... there was a brave and noble knight. 
Strikingly handsome. 
Who lived in a grand castle that weary travelers from near and far would come and visit. 
Now, this knight had been working his butt off for years. 
You'd think he'd be a shoo-in to rule the castle, right? 
- Right. 
- Wrong. 
Actually, he wasn't even a knight at all. 
Oh, no. 
He was, in fact, just a lowly peasant. 
And even though he was the son of the late, great Lord Marty... 
Thank you. 
and knew everything there is to know about running a castle, everyone just took him for granted. 
His name was Mr. Underappreciated. 
What's" underdemeciated"? 
- Under de-what? 
- Underdemeciated. 
That's right, I forgot you were six. 
His name was Sir... 
Fix-A-Lot. 
But alas, the kingdom where Sir Fix-A-Lot lived did not place much value on dedication or hard work, I guess. 
Because the superstar in all the land was Sir Butt-Kiss. 
And he spent all his days kissing everybody's butt. 
Boo! 
And my lord, yes, of course I can get you front row house seats to The Lion King. 
And Sir Fix-A-Lot had a best friend, Friar Fred, who was not right in the head. 
She never! 
No! 
Not our queen, I won't have that. 
- Were there any kids in the kingdom? 
- Yes, yes. Of course. 
There were two young pages. 
Mistress Stinky and Master Smelly. 
Hey-oh! 
And don't forget... 
Jillian! 
The queen of the fairies! 
Queen of the fairies? 
I mean, if she has to be there, let's just make her an angry raven. 
Parking spot! 
She should be a mermaid teacher. Yeah. 
The best mermaid teacher in the world. 
Children, open your books to page 16. 
Yes, Miss Mermaid. 
Let's begin. 
All right, she's a mermaid. Whatever you want. 
Anyways, back to the story. 
One day the king invited all his subjects to the castle. 
I bring glad tidings. 
For on this day I have chosen a champion who will run this castle and be my closest advisor and bestest buddy. 
My new champion is... 
Sir Butt-Kiss! 
Thank you. 
Poor Sir Fix-A-Lot had been passed over. 
So, Sir Fix-A-Lot moved into a giant shoe, got a bad case of athlete's face, dove into a moat... 
Ah, what the heck. 
and got eaten by crocodiles. 
The end. 
The end? 
That can't be the end. 
- Why? Why not? 
- It's not happy. 
There aren't happy endings in real life. 
Sooner you know that, the better. 
- It's not fair! - What? 
What's not fair? 
I mean, shouldn't Sir Fix-A-Lot at least get a shot to be champion? 
- A shot? Hmm... 
- If Sir Fix-A-Lot is better than Sir Butt-Kiss, he should get a chance to prove it. 
OK. Yeah, yeah, Bobbi, good. 
What the king really said was... 
On second thought, there is another worthy man in my kingdom, and it wouldn't be fair unless he got a shot, too. 
Sir Fix-A-Lot! 
And then the crowd went nuts. 
But, Sire, Fix-A-Lot is as common as muck. 
Boo! And Friar Fred drop-kicked a booing goblin. 
Boo! 
And the mermaid teacher did one of those weird tail dolphin moves. 
And Stinky and Smelly did the fastest Irish jig ever. 
Right on. 
Prince Bugsy busted out some fancy moves. 
And then... and then... 
It started raining gumballs. 
Raining gumballs? 
Why not? 
It's a bedtime story. 
Anything can happen. 
Yeah, yeah. I guess in a story. 
I just wish it was like that in real life. I really do. 
- What was that? 
He rings that bell when he's hungry? 
No, when he needs to go to sleep. 
OK. 
As you wish, Your Highness. 
All right, you guys, have a good sleep. 
You, too, uh, weird eyes. 
Well, I don't have much to work with, but I will make us a delicious breakfast that I know you will enjoy. 
Yes, some banana on the rice cake, and then what do we call this? 
I was told germs are bad for you, but here goes. 
I like it. 
A rice cake-banana-wheat germ sandwich. 
And what do we got? 
This is terrible. 
Doesn't your, your mother have taste buds? 
What are we doing here? 
We got nothing to use in this house. 
Hang on. 
A little flavor. 
It's good because, now we don't have to brush our teeth. 
There you go. 
At least we got a little mint going on. 
Guys want one? Hang on. 
Hello! 
Bronson? 
The television set in Mr. Nottingham's room is broken and it needs to be fixed right away. 
I have a situation here. 
I'm watching my nephew and my niece. 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
Are you having difficulty hearing me? 
Mr. Nottingham wants to watch television now! 
I hear you. 
I speak trollinese, don't worry. 
- There's a leprechaun behind you. 
Gotcha. 
Thanks a lot, gentlemen. 
OK. - Wow. 
- Yeah, it's pretty, huh? 
Whoa! I got to go fix my boss television set, but I need somebody to watch you two. 
Violet! 
Right here. 
Give a smile. 
Hang on. 
Violet! 
Skeeter Bronson, the handyman from the other day. 
Oh, right. Yes. 
Listen, uh, I got some kids with me right now. 
My nephew and niece. 
But, I gotta fix your father's TV. 
- Could you watch them for a few minutes? 
Yeah, yeah. 
Come in. 
- Mr. Nottingham, sir? 
- Uh, the telly won't turn on. It won't? 
Well, let me just take a... tallyho at it, OK? 
I'll just flip this light on. 
No, no, no, no! 
Absolutely not! 
I'm fighting a cold here. 
I must stay in the dark whenever possible. 
Do you realize germs can reproduce 80 percent faster in bright light? 
Oh, OK. 
Here we go, nice and dark again. 
- The germs are confused. 
- Come towards me. OK. 
It's got to be around here somewhere. 
For heaven's sake. 
I'm so sorry, sir. 
I just can't see a thing. 
- To your left, there. - Oh! 
There's the TV. 
So how's the, uh, new hotel coming, sir? 
Oh, very well. 
Still dealing with the city on building permits and whatnot. 
I can't tell you the secret theme. 
It's so good, we don't want anyone to steal it. 
- I hear you, sir. 
- OK, I'll tell you. 
Come along, sit down. 
Please. 
Great. 
Ready? 
Rock and roll. 
Vintage vinyl. 
Music memorabilia in the lobby. 
Oh, OK. Like, uh, like the Hard Rock? 
- The What What? 
- The Hard Rock Hotel. 
They've been using that theme for, like, years. 
Get Kendall Duncan up here straightaway, please. 
What a perfect little powder puff. 
Thank you. 
So, Patrick, truth or dare? 
Truth? 
How old were you the first time you kissed a girl? 
Patrick never kissed a girl. 
Girls are bis-crusting. 
Except for Trisha Sparks. 
Ooh, is that a girl in your class, you little Romeo? 
Hey, guys. 
Hi, Aunt Jill, did you get the note we left you? 
Yes, I did. 
And, uh, now we have to get you guys ready for school. 
So, come on. 
- Hi. 
- Hi. 
You're, uh... 
Here's your fat mouse. 
- It's a guinea pig, but... 
And you, young man... 
I want to hear all about this little Trisha Sparks next time I see you. 
Trisha Sparks is two years older than you. 
She's hot. 
I'm very disappointed in you, Kendall. 
We almost made an apocalyptic mistake. 
This rock and roll idea of yours is old hat. 
Well, sir, I had every intention of putting our own spin on it. 
Do you know what, Skeeter? 
I'm starting to get a fuzzy recollection of something I said to your father. 
In fact, I am going to give you a shot. 
If you can come up with a better theme than Kendall does, 
I'll let you run the new place instead. 
Oh, sir. 
Don't you think this is perhaps a little too much of a cruel joke to be playing on somebody as... 
well, the, the maintenance guy? 
- No, I don't. 
- No. 
Mr. Bronson has been working for this company for 25 years. 
I'm beginning to think I may have seriously underdemeciated him. 
I'm sorry. " Underdemeciated"? 
Precisely. 
You can both present your ideas at my birthday party this weekend. 
Thank you, Kendall. 
That is all. 
Mr. Bronson, the television, if you would. 
Oh, and do watch out for the germ vaporizer. 
The best day of my life! 
I like your car, pal. 
Hey, thanks, champ. 
You know what they say. 
You want to be the best, you got to drive the best. 
Hey, uh, not to get personal, but what's a sweet ride like that cost, anyways? 
You know what? Actually it's surprisingly affordable. 
Yeah? 
If you saved every paycheck you earn for the rest of your life and then multiply it by ten, you could probably buy my muffler. 
Oh, you wanna drag race, do you? 
You win! 
Good job. 
This is spooky. 
You've got to be kidding me! 
Look at this. I'm losing all my candy. 
How can you not see a 50-foot trailer? 
So you have to compete for your job with Skeeter Bronson. 
You'll annihilate him. 
Oh, I know. 
It's just a little degrading, that's all. 
Thanks for being there. 
I'll be there as long as there's a there to be at. 
Oh, hello, children. 
We're looking for Skeeter Bronson. 
Oh, Mr. Bronson. 
Yes, you'll find him in room 109. 
- OK. 
- Please, this way. 
- Oh, my God! Did you see that thing? 
- Those eyes. 
They were, they were staring into my, my very soul. 
- Hey, Uncle Skeeter! 
- Just who I wanted to see. 
- Hey, chief, here's Bugsy. 
- Got him. - Why do they have to stay here? 
Because I'm on call tonight, Jennifer. 
It's Jill, actually, Scooter. 
It is? 
OK, yeah... 
You did not just do that. I did. 
Watch. 
I'm gonna do it again. 
So, guys, anything weird happen to you today? 
I had a substitute teacher with an eye patch. 
Uh... that's a little weird. 
I'm talking like big-time weird. 
Maybe coincidence weird, uh... as in gumball weird? 
We're not allowed to chew gum. 
Of course you're not. 
You guys want to go to sleep? 
It's only 5 : 30. 
And we haven't had dinner. 
Hmm. OK. 
Room service! 
So you've never been skateboarding? 
You've never played video games? 
Mom says they rot your brain. 
That's not true. 
I've been playing video games my whole life, and look at me. 
Yeah, maybe she's got a point. 
You. 
You've never eaten bacon? 
What's bacon? 
Bacon is the juicy, fatty part of the pig right adjacent to the rear. 
But delicious and tasty, not how I just made it sound. 
And this is the first hamburger you've ever eaten? 
- What's the verdict? 
What do you think? - Life-changing. 
- Mom's gonna kill us. 
- No, she isn't. 
First of all, she's never gonna find out about this. 
And second of all, she used to eat plenty of hamburgers when we were growing up in this very room. 
She did? 
Looks like Bugsy's eaten a lot of burgers in the last ten minutes. 
He keeps going like that, we could make bacon out of Bugsy. 
He's kidding, Bugsy. 
Take it easy. OK. 
Let's get you carnivores to bed. 
I got a, a new story I want to lay on you. 
What do you think of cowboys and Indians? 
Oh, yes, tonight's the night! 
I just like cowboys and Indians'cause of the conflict. 
OK, once upon a time in the Old West, before room service was even invented... there was a farm hand named Jeremiah Skeets. 
He was looking to get ahead in the world, but was having a problem with his current mode of transportation. 
Uh, that was my horse. That wasn't me, everybody. 
Someone once told Jeremiah that if he wanted to be the best, he'd have to ride the best. 
You mind showing me your finest horse? 
My ancestors believe horse spirit come down from mountain during time of fire, wind. 
Many brave warrior walk trail of moon bear... OK. 
Look, I just want to see your finest horse, not a whole thing there. 
- Sorry. 
I can do it. 
- All right. 
Screaming Rooster, bring out Ferrari. 
Ferrari. 
Oh, my. 
Oh, my, oh, my! 
Look at that. 
I would get automatic respect riding such a beautiful animal, but I'm afraid that's just a bit out of my price range. 
Tell you what, white bread. 
I'll give you Ferrari... for free! 
Boo-yah! The end. 
I love it. 
Brilliant story. 
So he got the Ferrari for free. 
I love that. 
I love that. 
A guy getting a free horse? 
That's not a good story. 
Where's the arc? 
There's no arc. 
I've not learned anything. 
Also, you've got a moral obligation to them. 
What are they gonna walk away from that with? 
I didn't know we were doing an After School Special. 
Why can't he do something a real gentleman would do, like save a damsel in distress? 
Not a bad idea, munchkin. 
OK. So, uh... 
let's continue. 
Jeremiah was out for a ride when... 
Oh, please, don't! 
- Give us that jewelry. 
- You want my pearls? Help! 
Please! 
Oh, my necklace? 
Here, take it. 
Come on, boy! 
Here. 
What else you got, sweetie? 
Help! Help! 
Leave the lady alone! 
Care for a lift, ma'am? 
- Nice horse. 
- Oh, what, this old thing? 
Now, any of you gentlemen want to give the nice lady her stuff back? 
Not a chance, huh? 
Because I beg to differ! 
- My hero. 
- I like that. 
So Jeremiah spirited Miss Davenport away to safety, when she says... 
Shall we go drink champagne in a nearby hot tub? 
- Hot tub? - Mmm. 
Uh, yeah. 
No. 
I was saying that because I wanted to see if you two were paying attention. 
What happened was Jeremiah dropped Miss Davenport off in the nearest town, safe and sound. 
How ever can I thank you, sir? 
Ah, no thanks necessary, ma'am. 
But I do insist on expressing my gratitude in some manner. 
I'll take $ 100 million. Fair enough. 
The end. 
Let's hope it works. 
Very well written, brilliantly constructed. 
Jeremiah wouldn't take money for doing a good deed. 
Uh... I know Jeremiah a lot better than you guys. 
And believe me, he'd be all over that. He loves money. 
Mmm! 
I don't want that. 
Go back, rewrite. Rewrite. 
Gentlemen don't get paid. 
Will you just... 
Who's telling the story here? 
It should really end more like this. 
Well, I must give you some token of my appreciation. 
Oh, no. 
Perhaps... a kiss? 
Touchdown. 
Then an angry dwarf kicks him. 
What the heck did you do that for? 
Because I'm angry. 
- Go! Let's go! 
I didn't do nothing to you! 
- The end. - You know what? 
Laugh as much as you want. 
I'll take a Ferrari and a kiss any day of the week. 
I'd just like to kiss a Ferrari. 
- All right. Good night. 
- Good night, Uncle Skeeter. 
Good night, home slice. 
Thanks for the stories. 
You came up with all the good parts, Bobbi. 
Good night, y'all. 
You too there, Bugsy. 
And them braids look fantastic. 
They've taken years off you. 
You mind sleeping over? 
I'm gonna duck out a few hours. Oh, yeah, yeah. 
Mmm. 
By the way, um, 
I am, uh, legally obliged to tell you that I suffer from... 
sleep panic disorder. 
OK, what's, uh, sleep panic disorder? 
Believe me, you don't want to know. 
What am I thinking? 
Why would anyone give me a free Ferrari? 
I must be losing my mind. 
Much power of the horse underneath that hood. 
Hello. 
Are you the guy I'm supposed to see? 
I'm here, aren't I? 
So... am I about to get a cherry red Ferrari? 
I don't see why not. 
For... free? 
Sounds good to... me! 
What do I do now? 
Eat a gumball or something? 
Yes. 
- Fell out of the sky, right? 
- Yeah. 
I won't tell nobody. 
Now, close your eyes and count to three. 
- OK. 
- Then it's all gonna happen. 
- No. 
- Yeah. 
- One, two... 
three. 
Ferrari! 
Hey! 
My wallet! 
Not anymore! 
Excuse me. 
Hi, boys. 
OK, thank you. 
Thanks, guys. 
Sorry. 
I'm just trying to find my car. 
Good thing my wallet only had three dollars in it. 
And my Derek Jeter baseball card! 
Guys, guys, stop, please. 
You've had enough, now. 
Thank you. 
Stop! 
- Care for a lift, ma'am? - Skeeter? 
- Skeeter Bronson? 
- Yes, ma'am. 
What do you say you boys give the pretty lady back the pictures you took? 
Sure about that, now? 
Because I beg to differ. 
Guy's got a gun! 
I'm just happy they didn't make me use this thing. 
- My hero. 
- Really? 
That was brilliant, Skeeter. 
I don't know what happened. 
Something came over me. 
It felt good. It felt really good. 
How am I ever going to thank you? 
Hmm. No thanks is necessary, ma'am? 
Oh, am I in the presence of a gentleman? 
At your service, ma'am. 
Well, I must show my appreciation in some form. 
Consider yourself big people-bashed, sucker. 
I knew you were gonna show up. 
Get in the Gremlin, Jimmy, before Sasquatch calls the cops. 
Yeah,' cause that's how we do what we do. 
Right? 
That's what you get, buddy. Oh! Oh! 
Oh! Let's go! 
Yeah! 
Pull me in. 
Let's get out of here. 
Pull me in! 
Big people stink! 
OK, well, you don't see that every day. 
Indeed. 
And on that strange note, I bid you good night. 
Yes, yes. 
All right, so that's how I'm getting it. 
- Getting what? - This is just... 
I shouldn't. 
I, I couldn't. You know what? 
I can. 
I'm gonna take it. 
What are you talking about? 
I'm talking about a very generous girl who wants to give her rescuer a cherry red Ferrari... for free! 
This is sick! 
Well, uh, good luck with that. 
I'm just going to go. 
What do you mean? 
Do you have another one at your house? 
Am I, am I supposed to follow you or something? 
So seriously, no, no Ferrari? 
Where's the $ 100 million, at least? 
Boo! 
Hey, hey, hey! 
Get your own campaign vehicle. 
Yeah. 
- Hey, Aunt Jill. 
Hey, guys. 
How did last night go? 
An angry dwarf kicked me in the leg, and I didn't get a free Ferrari. 
So there you go. 
Oh. How sad. 
- He's talking about our bedtime story. 
- Oh. Uncle Skeeter said Jeremiah would get a new horse and a kiss, but I said the dwarf would kick him. 
You said it. 
Maybe that's how it works. 
The kids control the stories. 
And there are the wind chimes. 
You know what that means. 
What what means? 
Nothing. 
Don't worry about it. 
I won't. 
OK, guys. Um, what is Bugsy doing? 
Working off the hamburgers he ate last night. 
Yes, I gave Bugsy some hamburgers, but I gave the children that wheat germ stuff because that's what they love. 
I guess it's, uh, Bugsy watching the TV then too? 
Yeah, I flipped that on and, look, he's glued to it. 
I'm innocent! 
What was that? 
Uh... that was the sleep panic disorder, I believe. 
Why don't we, uh, get out of here before the next attack. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
Give your uncle a kiss. I'm a relative, I deserve it. 
Right there. 
Oh, that felt nice. 
How about one more for the road? 
- No. 
- Come on, baby! 
Don't worry, we'll be back tonight. 
Yeah, no, I'm not worried. 
You're coming back, we got a big story tonight! 
About some hotel theme ideas! 
Yeah! 
- Maybe we won't come back. 
- What? 
- Skeeter? 
- Sir Butt-Kiss. 
Sir... 
Kendall. 
I understand that you feel a need to prepare for our little... showdown. 
- Yeah. 
- That does not excuse you from maintenance responsibilities. 
- Oh, no. Check. - Lights are out in the spa. 
The south service elevator is running slow. Check. 
Let me try that cheesecake. 
Oh, another thing. 
I heard about your big hero act with my girlfriend last night. 
- This paparazzi was... 
- I know what it is you're trying to do, and it's not gonna work. 
You have to find another way to cozy up to the old man because I'm here to tell you 
Violet Nottingham is not gonna date a gum-scraping handyman. 
Hey, Kendall. 
Two things. 
First off, you got something right there. 
Yeah, now, use your hands. 
That's disturbing to see. 
Good. 
Secondly, when I get the job at the new hotel, 
I was actually considering keeping you on, so watch your tone with me. 
Your brief little trip to the land of make-believe is just about over, my friend. 
OK? 
We all know your failed father ran this hotel into the ground, and thankfully, you will not get the chance to make the same mistake all over again. 
May want to pick that up. 
- It's Duncan. 
- Lover, hello. 
I'm looking for the hotel site. 
I gave you the address, macho bunny. 
The address you gave me is no good. 
There's a school here. 
- Oh, what school? 
- Webster Elementary School. 
- Oh, then you're in the right place. 
- Is that so? 
- This school is being shut down. 
The old man pulled a few strings at the board of education. 
- Really? 
- We start demolition immediately. 
That is very exciting news. 
Oh, Pinky. 
Hello! 
Skeeter? 
Hey, it's Wendy. 
- Hey, sissy. - Hey. 
How's it going? 
- Are the kids OK? - Oh, yeah. 
We're having a blast. 
That was impressive, Bobbi, but Uncle Skeeter can jump over the couch the long way. 
- Skeeter, can I talk to them? 
- No, I'm taking them camping. 
- No. 
- Have fun in Arizona. 
Bye! 
Camping? 
No, Skeeter, they could get poison ivy! 
- Let's go. 
Quietly. 
- Where are we going? 
- Someplace special, fools. Whoo-hoo! 
Now march, march, march, march... 
March, march, march... 
Whoa! Cool! 
We're going to have ourselves a camp-out. 
You guys, look what he's done! 
Isn't this cool? 
- See? 
See how nice I am? - Yeah. 
Whoa, OK, just be careful around the fire. 
Hey, Jill. Shh. Don't want everyone to hear we're here. 
I heard about marshmallows. 
Saw them in magazines. 
I never imagined they would be this good. 
Let's just hope your mother doesn't find out I gave you any. 
- I won't tell her. 
- I'm not talking about you. 
She's the weak link. 
I think I can let this one slide. 
Ahh! The mermaid's being cool. 
Look at that. 
- The what? 
- The nothing. 
You know, when we were younger and your mom and I were out on the roof, my dad would always tell us to look at the stars and see if you could make something out of them. 
All right, like, uh... 
Right over there. 
Right over there. Look, look. 
To me, that looks like a camel. 
You see the humps? 
Huh? The tongue hanging out? 
Oh, yeah. 
I see that. Hey, look over there! It's a pyramid. 
Yeah! 
Hey, good one, Patrick. 
Look, right next to the moon. Right, right beside it. 
It looks exactly like Bugsy. 
Oh, my God! 
Don't worry, Bugsy. 
Your eyes are still bigger. 
Uncle Skeeter? 
Yes, good-looking. 
Do you think my father will come back? 
Well, that's a tough one. 
He must be going through some... mental malfunction to not want to be with you two guys every second of the day. 
But, uh, I do know this. 
You're always going to have your mother. 
You're always gonna have this girl to hang out with. 
And me, I ain't ever going anywhere. 
OK? 
I'm like the stink on your feet. 
I'll always be around. 
OK. You guys made me late. 
I hope you're happy. 
Well, thank you. 
Have fun at night school. 
See you tomorrow. 
All right, we got rid of her, so let's get to business. 
Put the s'mores down. 
Story time. 
All right, guys. Tonight's story's gonna be extra special. 
It's called... 
The Great Hotel Idea Story. 
Yeah! 
- What? 
- Boring. 
Come on, guys, I really need you to do this. 
It's gonna help my life a lot. 
All right, you know what? 
We still got one more night. Let's have a fun story. 
How about some Evel Knievel stuff? 
Racing, jumping, flying... 
Or maybe something like romantic? 
I have a good idea. 
Let's combine the action and the romance and make a romaction story. 
- Yeah. 
- Let us begin. 
The greatest of all the heroes in ancient Greece was, of course, Skeetacus. 
He was truly amazing yet totally underrated and had been ignored for years. 
Finally Skeetacus had his chance to show his skills in the grand arena. 
If he could impress the daughter of the emperor, he knew he would one day rule the land. 
- Skeetacus, Skeetacus! 
- Go on, Skeetacus! 
That's pretty fancy chariot work. 
For a peasant. 
Whoo! 
Oh, wh... what is he doing? 
Bring on the elephants! 
You know how Hercules supposedly founded the Olympics? 
Well, Skeetacus invented the X Games. 
He's never gonna make it! 
Now that's first class. 
Hey! - Bravo! 
- Wow. 
Can you dig it? 
Skeetacus! 
How we doing so far, huh? 
- This is the best story yet. 
- Can we get to the romance now? 
Well, shorty, you tell me? 
Does Skeetacus get the girl he was after? 
In these stories, the hero always gets the fairest maiden in the land. 
Yes! 
You said it! 
OK, so it's gonna happen! 
Uh, right. So, what? 
They're thirsty? 
They go off for drinks? 
A little wine and cheese action? 
Yes? 
Yeah, they can go to an old tavern. 
And guess who's there? 
Led Zeppelin. Say Led Zeppelin, please. 
No. 
All the girls that were mean to Skeetacus growing up. 
What? Nobody was mean to Skeetacus growing up. 
He was like the coolest guy in school. 
That's not what Mom said. 
All right, everybody was mean to Skeetacus. 
He had problems. 
All right, tell your story. 
Oh, my God... 
They see he's now with the fairest maiden in all the land, and they are really jealous. 
So jealous they don't know what to do. 
They just start nervously doing the hokey-pokey. 
OK. 
So then, Skeetacus takes his date out to the beach. 
All of a sudden, a big hairy guy washes up onshore, passed out. 
Why a hairy guy? 
I don't get it. 
Just' cause. 
He had something stuck in his throat, and he wasn't breathing. 
- Thanks. 
- He's OK. 
And then it starts pouring, so they run into a magical cave. 
- Caves are nice. 
- And Abe Lincoln's there. 
Abe Lincoln? 
What, is this a joke to you? 
What the heck's the matter with you? 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
I, I didn't mean to yell. 
The Abe Lincoln thing, that's, that's a good idea. 
It's just that, uh... 
Does Skeetacus get a kiss? 
Don't you think he should? 
It's... been a long time for him. 
His lips are very dry from not using them. 
Bugsy, you with me? 
We'll see. 
- Hello? 
- Mmm. 
Hey, is this the fairest maiden in the land? 
Mr. Skeeter Bronson, is that you? 
Yes, it is. 
Sorry about that Ferrari confusion the other night. 
I'm here at the beach right now and I had a hunch you might be here too. 
What do you say we get a little lunchsky? 
That sounds so delightful. 
But I can't. 
I'm afraid I'm on my way to Vegas for the day. 
Vegas? 
Uh, no one talked about Vegas. 
Don't tell Kendall. 
He thinks I'm in the library. 
Yeah, no. 
But, but, uh, princess, I, I really thought we were gonna hang out today. 
Oh, well. I will see you at Daddy's birthday party. 
Bye, Skeeter. 
Hmm. So our date's gonna be tomorrow? 
I can live with that. 
Hey! 
Look out! 
Sorry. 
Are you OK? 
I'm so sorry! 
What is it about the cushion of protection you don't like? 
Aren't you supposed to be in school? 
I'm supposed to be looking for a job now, but for some reason I felt like coming to the beach today. 
Huh. Um, are you hungry? 
Yes, I'm always hungry when I'm in pain. 
Good. 
Because I'm buying. 
I'll let you buy me lunch. 
Somebody stole my wallet, 
- so how was I gonna pay? 
- Of course you got your wallet stolen. 
- I don't know what that means. 
- You. It's always something with you. 
- Huh? 
- You're wearing my hat. - Gonna wear that all day? 
- I'm not wearing nobody's hat. 
- I'm wearing your hat! 
Oh! - I'll take it back. 
Thanks. 
This is perfect for your free lunch. 
Oh, my gosh. You guys, you guys, you guys. Over there. 
Is that... 
is that Skeeter Bronson? 
- Stop it. 
- Oh, my God. 
- Oh, my God. 
- Skeeter. 
Hey! 
Do you remember me? 
It's Donna Hynde from high school. 
Yeah, I do. 
Thought I was going to run into you shortly. 
And here you are. 
Yeah. 
Wow, this is so... 
weird. Uh... 
We were just planning our high school reunion. 
We were totally just talking about you. 
It's so weird. I was just talking about you guys too. 
Sure, he was. 
Mind pretending to be my girlfriend for a second? 
Yeah, I don't feel comfortable doing that. 
I'll, uh, convert my truck to biodiesel. 
- OK, I'll do it. - Ding-dong. 
Uh, this is my girlfriend, guys. 
This is Jill. 
Hello. 
She's your girlfriend? 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Yes, I am. 
- Right? 
- Yup. 
She thinks I'm... 
You want me to... 
Uh... romantic. 
She likes how romantic I can be. 
And, uh," great kisser," she likes to say. 
Oh, yeah. 
That's... a little too much. 
Sorry. 
- Wow, you are really pretty. 
- I mean, she's all right. 
- Thanks. 
I've seen hotter, but she's pretty cool. 
So super skinny. 
Skinnier than you. 
But... 
Yeah. 
Whatever. 
I feel really awful saying this out loud. 
We were really terrible to Skeeter in high school. 
Awful. So mean. 
My Skeeter? 
- They were. 
- You had a hard time in high school? 
Look at you now. 
You turned out pretty... cute. 
- Yeah! - You know... the pimples went away, and, uh, these came to play. 
- You want to touch them? - Oh, that's OK. 
- Later, later. 
- They're here for you. Ding-dong. 
- I think we should leave. 
- Yes. 
What's happening? 
Hey, so I spoke to Wendy. 
She's excited to see the kids tomorrow. 
This is the longest she's been away from them. 
That's right. 
This is my last night with the kids. 
You know, they're gonna be devastated. 
They worship you and those amazing bedtime stories you've been telling them. 
Oh, well, they say all the good parts. 
I promise. 
Oh, my gosh. Is he unconscious? 
Yeah, yeah. 
Boom! 
Thanks! 
- Yeah? 
- Check out Mr. Smooth. 
Well, you know, I do what I do. 
- Think we should get out of this rain? 
- What rain? 
Oh, shoot! Where did that come from? 
I don't know! 
Isn't it amazing? 
- Let's get out of this! 
- Let's go! Let's get out! 
Move it! 
I can read the future. 
Good God. 
So... 
So... 
The big presentation's tomorrow, right? 
I know you're not nervous or anything, but, um... good luck on it anyway. 
- Thank you. - Yep. 
Actually, you can come if you want. 
It's like a party. 
You know, Wendy's gonna be watching the kids, and we could have fun. 
You can meet me there. 
Yeah. 
That would, uh... 
I could do that. 
I could meet you, um... after night school or something. 
It's you? 
It's me what? 
You're the fairest maiden in the land? 
" Fair" as in" doesn't cheat at checkers"? 
No, fairest as in... 
" beautifulest." 
Wait, wait. 
Something weird's gonna happen. 
No, yeah, we don't... 
This is a mistake. 
No, no, no, not between us. 
I mean like, some... 
No, no! 
Oh, here comes Abe! 
No! 
Ah! Look. 
- Wow, a penny. - No, no, no. 
This is the weird thing I was talking about. 
Abe Lincoln. 
- Yeah. Yeah. 
- No, no, no, no. Abe's not gonna interrupt this time. 
That was it. It's supposed to end better than this. 
Stick around. 
I'm tellin' ya, you're gonna be missing out. 
Nice imagination, Patrick. 
- Skeeter? 
- Yo. We've got a little bit of a shaving situation in there. 
Oh, no, no, no. 
I took the razor blades out. 
Don't worry. 
Their father ain't around, I figured someone has to teach them how to shave. 
I'm Princess Leia. 
So, are you ready for the big showdown tomorrow night? 
Oh, yeah. 
What I'm going to do is tell them a bedtime story tonight. 
I'll have me win in the story. 
Then I'll win for reals. 
Do you dig? 
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, I understand. 
So it's like, um, positive visualization. 
I read a book on that once. 
Read the back cover, at least. 
I can't read. 
Shut up, Bugsy! 
I've got opposable thumbs. How do you feel about that? 
You children ready? 
Because here comes our last story. 
The fate of the entire universe hung in the balance, as the Supreme Galactic Council met to determine who would control the new planet in the vast Nottinghamian star system. 
Most in attendance expected Supreme Leader Barracto to rule in favor of General Kendallo, the evil governor of Hotelium. 
But there was a wild card in the mix... 
Skeeto Bronsonnian and his sidekick, Mickey Doo Quicky Doo. 
They all watched with excitement. 
Lieutenant Jilli and her two young cadets, 
Aspenoff, and even the great Captain Bugzoid. 
Hey, since it's outer space, Skeeto should talk like a goofy alien. 
What? 
That's disgusting. 
I'm not going to translate that. 
Silence! 
The leader of the new planet shall be determined the old-fashioned way : 
A zero-gravity fight. 
OK, now we get to the part the crowd came to see. 
Skeeto defeating Kendallo, right? 
I think we need to see them battle first. 
Kendallo makes the first move. 
- Skeeto! 
- But the kids really want to see Skeeto kick his butt, right? 
Wet willy. 
Boring! 
Uh, bring out the booger monster! 
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick. 
All right, have the booger monster smack Kendallo around. 
No, I think he should kiss him. 
Would you get to Skeeto winning already? 
OK. 
Arise, Skeeto, sharif of Nottinghamia. 
And that is the perfect ending to our last story. 
Thank you, children. 
Oh, that's not the ending. 
Yeah. 
That would be too obvious. 
What do you mean? 
Somebody threw a fireball at Skeeto and Skeeto got incineratated. 
- The end. 
-" Incineratated"? 
You mean" incinerated"? 
No! 
No, no! 
He can't catch on fire. 
Yeah. 
I'm Captain Skeeto. 
I'm on fire! 
No, no, no. 
The story can't end like that. 
What happened to a nice, happy ending? 
You said happy endings don't really happen. 
We want our story to be real. 
Oh, I was just saying that. 
I was stupid. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
So, what? We're really going to have me on fire? 
Hey! Don't fall asleep, or the story will lock. 
Stop it! Wake up! 
Wake up. 
Wake up. Wake up. 
I can't believe Skeeter didn't tell you. 
And I'm sure it's just a coincidence that the new hotel is going up right here where the, where the school is. 
Well, I'm pretty sure... 
Excuse me. 
Yeah. Everything's ready for the presentation. 
- Good. 
- Ten-four, rubber duck. 
Got it. 
Great. 
OK. The good news is, you're going to win the competition. 
The bad news is, you're probably gonna catch on fire, but not if you take a few precautions. 
Oven mitts, smoke alarm. 
Yeah. 
" Flame-resistant Christmas tree spray." Yeah. 
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, this will work. 
Excuse me. 
Sir? Those are actually for Christmas trees. 
I know.' Tis the season. 
- Ow! God! 
- I'm so sorry. 
It burns! 
Here, let me make it up to you. 
- Ow! - It's for trees! 
It's for trees! 
You're right! 
That hurts! 
I'm sorry about that! 
Antibacterial wipes, anybody? 
Aloha. 
Aloha. 
Thank you so much. 
Steady. 
Steady. 
- Kona coffee ice cream. - Yeah? 
What's the catch? 
You're gonna light it on fire? 
'Cause I'm on to you, honey. 
No fire. 
It would melt. 
Just take the ice cream and a chill pill. 
- Skeeter. 
- Yes. 
- That wasn't very nice. 
- What wasn't? 
- You pushed that man in the pool. 
- No, he jumped in. 
Hey, you see Jill around? 
No, I ain't, I ain't seen Jill tonight, mate. 
Ooh! I am cold. 
I'll get you a towel. 
- I've got your towel. 
- Oh, blimey. 
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
I love you. 
You brought me a grilled cheese sandwich once. 
Yeah. I did, yes. 
It was Monterey Jack. 
It's a good cheese. 
Ow! Skeeter, are you all right? 
A bee stung my tongue! 
The meeting for the exciting new hotel will take place in the living room. 
So I don't think you're going to want to miss this. 
No, it's swelling up! 
- Can I sit there, please, mate? 
- Yes, of course. 
- Don't touch me. 
- Sorry. 
Before we begin, I would just like to say, personally, happy birthday. 
Happy birthday. 
Happy birthday, Daddy. 
Thank you, Kendall. 
Yes, now, as you can see, 
I've invited some of the staff to sit in to see how your ideas would play with the" regular folk." 
- No offense. 
- None taken, Barry. None taken. 
So, gentlemen, which of you would like to go first? 
Fair enough. 
Mr. Nottingham, you were absolutely right when you said the rock and roll theme was old hat. 
Gone. 
Your insight, sir, has inspired me to, to dig deeper, to find the commonality at the heart of the American experience. 
I speak, of course... of the musical theater. 
And, more specifically... 
Broadway! 
Hit it. 
Original, impressive, well done. 
Thank you, Kendall. 
Thank you, sir. 
Uh, sorry about that. I was, uh, just resting my eyes. 
Skeeter. 
You're up. 
Are you all right, Skeeter? 
A bee bit my tongue. 
I'm sorry? 
A bee... stung my tongue. 
" A bee stung my tongue." 
Oh, you understand him? 
How did a bee sting your tongue? 
Uh... I was eating ice cream, and suddenly a bee... 
Uh, it was on an ice cream, and he licked it. 
Can you translate Skeeter's presentation for us? 
- Uh... Yes! 
Yes, I can do that. 
Thank you. 
Ready? 
- I'm ready. 
OK. 
" I spent the last week in the hotel, the hotel where I live..." 
With my niece and nephew. 
" With my niece and my nephew." 
" To a kid, everything about a hotel is strange and wonderful." 
" Sleeping in a different bed." 
" Hanging out in the lobby." 
" Jumping up and down on the alligator." 
" Riding up and down in the elevator." 
Ah! Yeah, I see now that an alligator wouldn't be in that context. Sorry. 
" Some hotels try to make it seem as much like home as possible." 
" But they're missing the point." 
" If you wanted to stay in a place like home, then why not stay at home?" 
" Our guests should experience an escape from the everyday." 
" And that's what I'd like to capture in our new hotel." 
" What every kid knows and what every adult has forgotten." 
" Like my father said to me, your fun is only limited by your imagination." 
- That was beautiful. 
- Yeah? 
All right. Settle down. 
Just the way it built. 
And that's it? 
I'm sorry. I don't understand it. 
That... was... brilliant! 
Congratulations, my boy. 
You've just won the keys to the kingdom. 
Boogie, don't do that. 
Congratulations. 
Great job. Keep icing that tongue. 
- All right. 
- Congratulations, Skeeter. 
- Congratulations. 
That was great. - Yeah? 
That's just terrific. 
Congratulations, Skeeter. 
All right, Kendall. Yeah. 
No hard feelings, pal. 
Of course not. 
You deserve it. 
You're a better man than me. 
- You have an iron will. - Yeah. 
That's what they say. 
I would not have the guts to tear down the school my niece and nephew attend. 
What? 
You do know that's the site for the new hotel? 
What are you talking about? 
- Good show, old son. 
- Oh, sir. 
That bee sting language was really working for you on a sympathetic level. 
Good, I'm glad. 
I wanted to talk to you about the location that we're building the hotel. 
Bronson, you're fired! 
Fired? 
Oh... That's how it connects. 
Yes? 
Do you know where Jill Hastings' class is? 
It's right over there. 
Why won't you answer my calls? 
Because I know it's you calling. 
You got to believe me, Jill. 
I had no idea... 
Don't destroy the sliver of respect I have for you by making lame excuses. 
Just go away and stay away. 
Uncle Skeeter? 
Do you want to incinertate our school'cause we incinertated you in the story? 
No, I wouldn't do that. 
We thought you were supposed to be the good guy. 
So did I. 
" Skeeto defeats Kendallo." 
Not really. 
- Yeah? 
Welcome back. 
So, you mad at me, too? 
Not as mad as Jill, but, uh, mad, yes. 
I didn't know the new hotel was going up there. 
I figured that. 
Then what are you mad at? 
I gave the kids junk food? 
No, I figured you'd do that too. 
I'm mad because you told my kids that in real life there are no happy endings. 
Well, look around you, Wendy. 
Do you see any happy endings here? 
I don't know. 
You and Dad always had so much fun in this room. 
For whatever reason, I didn't. 
I was always the cynic, the, the sourpuss. 
The black cloud. 
The energy drainer. 
The... dead fish. 
Yes, all of those things. 
But when I left Bobbi and Patrick with you, 
I guess I just was hoping you'd rub off on them. 
Get them to be lighter. 
Have fun. 
Enjoy themselves. 
I thought Dad would like that. 
Anyway, um, I got a job in Arizona. 
Teaching, not principaling. 
That's cool. 
Yeah, well, maybe you can come visit when we get settled. 
I know by then the kids will really want to see you. 
All right. 
Love you. 
Love you. 
And so Skeeter sat on his bed, filled with regret, wondering how to put the pieces of his life together after one magical week. 
- Great ending, huh? 
- That was your ending, son? 
I thought this was just a sad part, and you were about to make it better. 
What? How could I make it any better? 
Well, In the stories I told you, just when things looked bleakest, the hero would do something unexpected and courageous to beat the bad guy, save the day, and get the girl! 
Yeah. 
How can I do that? 
It's your story, not mine. 
But you better get moving. 
Mr. Nottingham! Mr. Nottingham? 
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment. 
My name is Jill Hastings. 
I'm a teacher at Webster Elementary. 
Save our school! 
Save our school! 
Save our school! Save our school! 
Save our school! 
My men are in position. 
We are ready for the demolition. 
Excellent. 
Mr. Nottingham said he'd call if he had a problem getting the variance, so if we don't hear from him in the next 20 minutes, 
I say we just... blow it all up. 
Madam, the war is over. 
You lost. I'm sorry. 
This isn't a war, Mr. Nottingham. 
We're talking about children. 
There must be other possible sites for your hotel complex that would not result in the displacement... 
Hey, hey! 
Barry, Jill. 
How you doing? We're just wrapping up here. 
Donna, you remember Jill, right? 
Of course! 
Oh, my God. That jacket is so cute! 
Uh, thank you. 
Bronson, what are you doing here? 
What am I doing here? 
Yeah, what am I doing here? 
Oh, uh, well, Mr. Bronson, as a concerned citizen, wanted to bring points to my attention before I made any hasty decisions about the property. 
And they are points that are going to take me years to analyze. 
- Years? 
- Years. 
Bronson, are you playing hardball with me? 
I am, sir. 
Because your application for variance has been... 
Denied. 
Denied? 
Yes. But the good news is 
Donna and I found you another piece of property right on the beach in Santa Monica that is uptight and out of sight. 
Beachfront was my first choice, but it's not for sale. 
It is now. 
It is! 
Isn't that fabulous? 
Really? 
Friends? 
Oh, oh. 
Yeah, well, germs. 
Let's get past that. 
Come here. Come here. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
I'm touching you, and it's OK. Look at that. 
Aw... Ooh. 
You're enjoying it. 
Good. Bring me closer. 
That is so sweet. 
And creepy. 
- Attention, please, ladies and gentlemen. 
We are working with highly-sensitive, dangerous radio-controlled explosives. 
Boo! 
And so to avoid any tragic misfires, 
I would ask that you all turn off your cell phones. 
All of you, please. 
Turn your cell phones off. 
Did you really just fix everything? 
Not everything. 
- Yes? 
- We appear to have a situation. 
I can't reach Kendall on his cell phone to halt the demolition which will begin in... 13 minutes. 
This sign we made is awesome! 
We need a window where those construction guys can see it. 
Then they'll change their minds. 
Bobbi, I found one. 
That's my Prius! 
- OK. Where's your truck? 
- My truck? 
I had to give it back to the hotel. 
What do you mean you gave it back to the hotel? 
Come here! Come here! 
Sorry! 
It's for a good cause! 
Have you ever driven a motorcycle? 
No! 
Oh, my God! 
Have you seen Bobbi? 
Patrick? 
Bobbi! 
Patrick! 
What are you going to do? 
I'll take that back. 
No fair! 
Hey, people, that's 60 seconds! 
Wait! Wait a minute! 
I can't find my children! 
- They might be in there! 
- Nice try. 
We cleared the building hours ago. 
OK? 
No! 
Let me through! 
Hey, we got to check the rooms before we start making booms. 
We've checked it already! 
Do it myself. 
Uncle Skeeter! 
Hey! 
- Five... 
- No! 
- Grab the bar! 
Three... 
Two... 
One! 
The king has issued a proclamation. 
The hotel moves away. 
The school will stay. 
Long live Webster Elementary! 
- Mom! 
- Mom! Bobbi! 
Patrick! 
Hey, hey, hey. You guys underdemeciated me. 
Come here! 
I just got to know you guys. 
You think I'm gonna let you slip away from me now? 
I knew you were the good guy. 
Yeah. 
Uh, Patrick, hi. I'm Trisha Sparks. 
I just wanted you to know that... 
thanks for saving the school. 
Western. 
Go Western. 
- No thanks necessary, ma'am. - That's my boy. 
That's my boy. 
There must be some way for me to show my appreciation. 
Oh-ho-ho! 
Hoo-hoo-hoo! Hey, isn't she a little old for you? 
- She's hot. 
- So is she. 
What do you think? 
If Master Stinky's getting a kiss, shouldn't, shouldn't I get a little mermaid action? 
- Come on, already. 
Now look what my boy has done. 
Turned his back on the world of luxury hotel management to start a small family business. 
And bless his heart, he even named it after me. 
Hey, speaking of s'mores, it looks like Bugsy ate them all. 
We're completely out of marshmallows. 
Oh, all right. 
Let me handle that. Room service! 
- Yes, sir? 
- Hi, Kendall. 
Uh, Bugsy's out of marshmallows. 
If you could just go get him some, that would be great. 
Right on it, sir. 
Anything else? 
Uh, not from you, Kendall, but, uh Housekeeping? 
Hey, Aspen. 
Could you just make sure that Bugsy's cage is clean before he checks out in the morning? 
His marshmallows don't agree with him, there's gonna be a mess. 
OK, bye, guys. 
I think Bugsy is trying to tell us that our tale has reached its end. 
But before I go, let me tell you what our heroes and villains are doing now. 
My old friend, Barry Nottingham, overcame his fear of germs to such a degree that he decided to leave the hotel business and enter the field of medicine. 
He is currently the school nurse at Webster Elementary. 
Violet now runs the hotel empire, along with her husband, Mickey, the former room service waiter who is now the ninth-richest person in the world. 
And Skeeter and Jill? 
After the double wedding of the century, they lived... well, happily ever after, running Marty's Motel and spending a lot of time with my grandkids, whose adventures have just begun. 
Though, not everyone is quite so excited. 
But that is a whole other story. 
The end. 
Previously on" Lost"... 
Can you hear me? 
Yes! 
Yes, I can hear you. 
Hey, are you on a boat? 
- What--what boat? 
- Your boat. 
I'm not on a boat. 
Uh, na-Naomi, the parachutist. 
Who? 
Who's Naomi? 
I've got it. 
I've got a signal! 
It's gonna work. 
It's happening. 
We're gonna get off of this island. 
Hello? 
Is Desmond there? 
Penny! 
No! 
I'm telling you, making that call is the beginning of the end. 
Who is this? 
Who is this? 
I'm one of the survivors of oceanic flight 815. 
Can you get a fix on our location? 
Sit tight. 
We'll be right there. 
It's almost 30 minutes now since the start of this high-speed chase. 
We still have no information about who's driving this vehicle. 
Jeff, can you tell us where the chase started? 
Ruth, we're hearing reports that the pursuit began near the la brea area, then traveled through a warehousing district south of the 10 freeway. 
Can you see how many people are in the car? 
It appears to be just the one- - the driver. 
We're not sure if that's the owner of the car. 
What you're seeing here are pictures of the 10 freeway south of downtown. 
Is that a camaro, jeff? 
Yes, it looks like a-a vintage, early' 70s model. 
Damn it. 
Show us your hands! 
Roll down the window and show us your hands now! 
Now slowly open the door with your left hand. 
Get out of the car! 
Turnround... 
Slow! 
On the ground! 
Now! 
Stop! 
Dot you know who I am? 
Stop! Wait! 
don't you know who I am? 
I'm one of the oceanic six! 
I'one of the oceanic six! 
Lost Season4 Episode01...... 
Across the city, you're minding your own business in a convenience store, until you see something and freak out. 
Mr. Reyes, why'd you run like that? 
Who'd you see in there? 
Listen, buddy, I know you saw somebody in that store that made you run away and go on a high-speed- - 
I wasn't running away from anyone. 
If you think I care that you're a celebrity, you crashed your camaro in the wrong neighborhood. 
I'm not a celebrity. 
Is that why you kept shouting," hey, I'm one of the oceanic six"? 
You wanna know a funny coincidence? 
Sure. 
I knew somebody your plane. 
Really? 
Her name was ana lucia cortez. 
She was my partner before I made detective- - dark hair... 
Gorgeous. 
Maybe you knew her. 
Maybe you met her on the plane... 
Before it took off? 
Sorry. 
Never met her. 
Why don't you watch the tape? 
Maybe it'll spark something. 
I'm gonna get a doughnut. 
You want one? 
No, thanks. 
And when I come back, you're gonna tell me who you ran from. 
Help! 
Help! 
Help! 
Let me out! 
What the hell is wrong with you? 
What are you doing, reyes? 
Huh? 
You trying to get tossed into the nuthouse? 
Because if that's what you want, I can make that happen right now, my friend. 
You can? 
Oh, thank you! 
Thank you. 
Jack? 
You there, dude? 
Beach to Jack, come in, Jack. 
Beach to Jack. 
Right here, Hurley. 
What's up? 
Hey, uh, did you guys make it to that radio tower thingy yet? 
Yeah, and I talked to the people on the boat. 
They're on their way to pick us up right now. 
Seriously? 
It worked? 
Seriously. 
We're all on the way back to the beach right now, so you better pack your bags, buddy. 
Dude, that's great! 
Any luck? 
Nothing. 
No sign of him. 
It's like he just disappeared. 
Why would Locke kill her? 
- He hadn't even met her - - because he's crazy. 
So what if he comes back? 
If he comes back, I'm gonna kill him. 
I'm gonna get everybod together. 
The sooner we get back to the beach, the better. 
Are we really going home? 
Yeah, we're really going home. 
I can't believe I'm actually going to have my baby in a hospital. 
- Oh, rub it in, why don't you? 
- Oh, no. 
You ladies need a hand? 
No, we're just wrapping things up, thanks. 
You know, you must be very proud of bernard. 
I hear he's quite the hero. 
Look, everyone up here knows that the real hero is your man, claire. 
If Charlie didn't turn off that gizmo, we'd still be getting a busy signal on that fancy phon so you better make sure you treat him real good when we get back. 
Rose! 
Okay, thanks. 
I have enough. 
I need you to do me a favor. 
I need you to take alex and get as far from here as possible. 
- What? 
- We don't have time for this. 
Everyone who stays here is going to die. 
Now get alex and get away right now. 
I don't care where you go. 
Just go. 
I will not have my daughter- - she's not your daughter. 
Did I ever tell you I won the lottery? 
I got, like, $ 150 million. 
Worst thing that ever happened to me. 
Oh, yeah, who needs $ 150 million, right? 
Now it'll all be gone,'cause they all think I'm dead. 
When we get rescued, and I go back... 
I'm gonna be free. 
I wanna do a cannonball. 
I've been walking up and down this beach every day and looking out at this water, and I wanna do a cannonball. 
Hurley... 
You wanna do a cannonball, cannonball. 
Are you all right, Desmond? 
We need to get to Jack. 
We can't let him get in touch with that boat. 
Easy, Scotty. 
Everything's cool. 
Boat's on the way. 
- What? 
- On the way? No. 
Hey, where's Charlie? 
No, that woman- - Naomi- - she lied. 
Look, the people on the boat aren't who they say they are! 
- What? 
- Then who are they? 
- Desmond, where's Charlie? 
- I don't know. But we need to get in touch with Jack now! 
We can call him. 
We have a walkie. 
- Where is it? 
- Get it. 
- What do you mean the people aren't who they say - - where's Charlie? 
I'm--I'm--I'm sorry, brother. 
You think that's our ride? 
Hello? 
Hey, Jack. 
This is george minkowski. 
We're trying to get a lock on your signal there, but we're getting some rf interference. 
We're gonna need to rejigger some of the settings on your sat-phone. 
Uh, sure. 
Okay. Just tell me what I gotta do. 
How about you put Naomi on? 
Naomi went to get some firewood. 
Can you hold on for a second? 
Let me see if I can... 
Where is she? 
I don't know. 
We gotta call the doc. 
Did you listen to Desmond? 
- Charlie wrote on his hand - 
- Look, I'm sorry he's dead, but I don't even know what the hell" not penny's boat" means. 
Calling Jack accomplishes nothing. 
It would accomplish warning him... 
It also means warning the people on the freighter that we're suspicious of them. 
I have no doubt they're monitoring our communications. 
- If we call Jack - 
- You know what? 
I got the walkie. 
I'm making the call. 
We better get goin'. 
Going where? 
I found blood--the girl's trail. 
Probably crawled away. 
Can't be more than ten minutes ahead of us. 
We should go now and find her. 
We're taking him with us. 
And why would we do that? 
Because I don't trust him with anybody but me. 
All right, listen up. 
I need all of you to head back down to the beach, and when these people show up, we wanna make sure that we're real easy for them to find, okay? 
You look worried, Jack. 
The only thing I'm worried about is missing our ride home. 
I found her trail. 
She's headed west across the island. 
Rousseau already found it. 
We're going after her right now. 
What? 
Are you sure it's hers? 
Unless someone else is bleeding. 
But if she didn't want us to find her, then she could've created a dummy trail 
I think we should follow both- - 
Kate, 6 hours from now, we'll be sitting on that boat laughing about the fact that there was one final thing that we couldn't agree upon. 
Naomi is hurt. 
She ran into the jungle. 
She's not thinking about leaving fake trails. 
You're right. 
I'll track her down. 
Why don't you get everybody back to the beach? 
You got it. 
Be careful, okay? 
What the hell's gotten into you, hugo? 
They'll all be back in the morning. 
If we just wait- - you don't wait with warnings. 
You... warn. 
Here I was thinking I was gonna get a good night's sleep. 
You almost got me that time. 
How about best out of seven? 
Are you ready for your meds, hugo? 
Oh, by the way, you have a visitor. 
Mr. Reyes. 
Hello. 
My name is matthew abbadon. 
I'm an attorney for oceanic airlines. 
Can we talk for a few minutes? 
Okay. 
I'm here, Mr. Reyes, because we've heard about your recent... 
Episode. 
Your arrest, your incarceration here- - frankly, we feel terrible about it. 
So on behalf of oceanic, I'd like to extend you an invitation for a little upgrade. 
What... 
Kind of upgrade? 
To a facility where the paint isn't peeling off the walls, where you'd have your own bathroom. 
- You can see the ocean from - 
- I don't wanna see the ocean. 
No problem. 
Actually, thanks. 
I'M... 
I'm fine right here. 
Are you fine, Mr. Reyes? 
What do you mean? 
You're in a mental institution. 
Who'd you say you were again? 
I'd like to see a business card. 
I must have left them at home. 
Then we're done, dude. 
Are they still alive? 
What? 
You heard me. 
Nurse! 
Get out of here! 
You better get outta here! 
Help me! 
He's after me. 
No, no, no, no. 
That guy's after me! 
Help me! 
You all right there, hugo? 
Yeah, dude, I'm fine. 
You wanna talk about it? 
Talk about what? 
Charlie. 
I mean... 
You two were buddies. 
I just thought... 
We'll probably get to Jack faster if we don't talk. 
I'm gonna head up and tell them to slow down a little. 
I can keep up. 
All right, ese. 
Just... 
Holler if you need me. 
Guys? 
Guys! 
Guys! 
Guys! 
Guys! 
The blood trail ends here. 
What do you mean? 
It ends. 
What, are you telling me that she stopped bleeding here? 
No, I'm telling you that she fooled us and doubled back. 
Better call the boat, ll' em she's getting a really big bundle of firewood 
where is it? 
Okay, I probably should have told you that I saw her take the phone, but you beat me up, Jack. 
I owed you one. 
What are you talking about? 
Kate took it when she hugged you. 
She found thright trail, too, but you wouldn't listen to her, so I guess she's taken matters into her own hands. 
But look on the bright sid at least somebody around here knows what the hell they're doing. 
Hello? 
Who's this? 
Uh, this is Kate. 
You with Jack? 
No, no, he's not here. 
Where's Naomi? 
Uh, we're looking for her. 
What do you mean, you're looking for her? 
Give me the phone. 
Give me the phone. 
Naomi, listen to me. 
You're hurt. 
Let me help you. 
Help me? 
I just spent the last three days trying to get you people rescued, and you throw this knifen my back. 
- No, that was not us. 
- Who? 
- His name is John Locke. 
- What? 
He said that you weren't who you said you were. 
I swear to god we would never hurt you. 
You know us. 
Please, we need your help. 
Please help us. 
Give me the phone. 
George, it's Naomi. 
Naomi, where have you been? 
What's going on over there? 
I had an accident. 
I'm hurt. 
What? 
A-an accident? 
What--what--what accident? 
What happened? 
Naomi! 
Hello? 
Hello? 
I hit a tree branch when I parachuted in. 
Took it through my gut. 
Why did they tell me you were getting firewood? 
I guess they were afraid to tell you what happened to me till I could talk to you myself. 
We've lost our signal, and can't come get you. 
Can you change your tracking frequency? 
Yeah. 
Try it now. 
Clear as a bell. 
Hang on, Naomi. 
We'll--we'll get you back here asap, okay? 
I'm sorry, george. 
Just tell my sister that I love her. 
Hello? 
Help! 
Help! 
Help! 
There's nothing here. 
There's nothing here. 
There's nothing here. 
There's nothing here. 
Hello, hugo. 
You got yourself good and lost out here, hugo. 
How did you get separated from the group? 
I just... 
Fell behind, I guess. 
Is that why you were shouting for help? 
Well, I got scared. 
What Desmond said happened down in that station- -" not penny's boat"... 
Are you sure that's what Charlie wrote on his hand? 
Jack should never have called those people. 
I couldn't agree more. 
It's gonna be hard to... 
Talk him into thinking they're not coming here to rescue us. 
Well, we're just gonna have to try our best, hugo, because if we can't talk him out of it... 
Then Charlie died for nothing. 
Where the hell you been, hugo? 
Sorry. 
I was just, uh, I got lost. 
What are you doing here? 
I came here for the same reason you did--to warn Jack about the people on that boat. 
I already gave it a shot, but I figured I might have better luck with some support. 
You want my support? 
You can tell me why you destroyed that submarine. 
Still in one piece. 
Rambo. 
I'll tell her. 
He's dead. 
Charlie'S... dead. 
No. 
I'd watch out if I were you. 
What are you talking about, dude? 
There's a guy over there. 
He's staring at you. 
What guy? 
That guy. 
Hey, man. 
Don't run. 
Hurley. 
Just... just... 
Sit down. 
I wanna talk to you. 
Come on. 
Don't do what you did in the store. 
Okay? 
There's no need to... 
freak out. 
No need to freak out? 
I'm trying to buy some jerky and a slushee, and suddenly you're standing there over by the ho hos. 
You're dead. 
What do you expect me to do? 
Can we just... sit down? 
I may be in a mental hospital, but I know you're dead, and I'm not having an imaginary conversation with you. 
I am dead. 
But I'm also here. 
Okay, prove it. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Did you know you were going to die when you swam out there? 
Why didn't you tell me? 
Because you would have tried to stop me. 
And since I was gonna do it anyway, I thought I would spare you all the drama. 
And now you have to do something. 
But you're hiding from it. 
That's the real reason you ran when you saw me in the store. 
- You knew I was here to tell you - - no, I'm not listening to this. 
No,' cause you're not here. 
I am here. 
You're being a baby. 
I'm gonna close my eyes and count to five, and when I open' em, you'll be gone. 
- I am here. 
- One... 
- don't do this. 
- Two... 
- they need you. 
- Three... 
- they need you, hugo. 
- Four! 
- You know they need you. 
- Five! 
What... what happened? 
I mean, how- - how did he... 
He was trying to help us. 
Jack 
You * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * 
it's not loaded. 
Let go of me! 
- Do you know what he did? 
- Yes, I know what he did! 
All I did... 
All I have ever done... 
Has been in the best interest of all of us. 
Are you insane? 
I know I... 
I have a lot of explaining to do. 
But I never did anything to hurt any of you. 
I even risked my life to tell you that there was a traitor in your midst. 
She helped us, John. 
All you ever did was blow up every chance we had of getting off this island. 
You killed Naomi! 
Well, technically, he didn't kill her yet. 
Yes, he did. 
She just died. 
She didn't give you up, John. 
She covered for us, and she fixed this. 
They're on their way. 
She didn't cover for anyone. 
She wants her people to come here. 
And trust me, when they do, we had better be far away from here. 
I'm going to the barracks. 
The others abandoned them. 
It's the only place on the island with any form of security right now. 
It'll have to do until I can think of something else. 
Until then, if you want to live, you need to come with me. 
No one's going anywhere with you, John, because they're not crazy. 
He's not crazy. 
What about Charlie? 
Charlie went down to that place so we could all be rescued. 
And whatever he did down there... 
it worked. 
But then something must've happened. 
He must have heard something before he... 
I don't know why, but it changed his mind. 
Because the last thing he did was to warn us at the people on that boat are not who they said they were. 
So I'm not listening to you. 
I'm listening to my friend. 
I'm listening to Charlie. 
Anyone else? 
There isn't much time. 
Jack, with your permission, I'd like to go with John. 
He's all yours. 
You said we'd never leave the island. 
If you, uh, you wanna go with Locke, I'll be right behind ya. 
I'm not going anywhere with that man. 
What are you doing? 
Same thing I've always done, Kate... 
Survivin'. 
You know where to find us when you change your mind. 
You ever miss? 
Jack. 
Yeah. 
I was, uh, on my way back from a consult. 
Thought I'd drop by and pay you a visit. 
Horse? 
You're on. 
So... consult, huh? 
Does that mean you're back doing surgical stuff? 
Yeah. 
" H." 
Reporters leaving you alone? 
Yeah. 
Still have to sign some autographs when I go out for coffee, but... 
Thinking about growing a beard. 
You'd look weird with a beard, dude. 
That's h-O. 
So... 
What are you really doing here, Jack? 
I was just checking on you, seeing if everything was okay. 
You're checking to see if I went nuts, if I was gonna tell. 
Are you? 
You're up. 
Nah, you win. 
I, uh... 
Gotta run. 
It was gat seeing you, Hurley. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry I went with Locke. 
I should've stayed with you. 
It's water under the bridge, man. 
I don't think we did the right thing, Jack. 
- I think it wants us to come back. 
- Hurley... 
- and it's gonna do everything it can - - we're never going back. 
Never say never, dude. 
Are you thinking of Charlie? 
Feels like a hundred years ago that we came out here together. 
How did this happen? 
Thunder's getting louder. 
That's not thunder. 
Come on. 
Come on. 
Are you Jack? 
Where do you think you're going? 
Out. 
With who? 
Him? 
Yes, and you can't stop me. 
I'm in love. 
He's twice your age, Emily. 
So what, mom? 
Are you jealous? 
Emily, wait a minute. 
Emily, listen to me! 
Emily! 
Get back here, young lady, right now! 
You can't stop me! 
I love him! 
Emily! 
Honey, can you hear me? 
Honey, can you hear me? 
That's good. 
Try and stay awake now. 
- She's bleeding. 
- Her heartbeat's dropping fast. 
I'm pregnant. 
What? 
What did you say? 
I'm pregnant. 
I'm five... 
I'm almost six months. 
She... she's pregnant. 
Get the clamps ready. 
That's it, Emily. 
Good girl. 
Baby's crowning. She's crowning. 
Dilated and ready to go. 
That's it. 
Okay, sweetheart. 
All right, there you go. 
Wrap you up nice and warm. 
We'll just take you over here now. 
Margaret, would you put him in for me, please? 
My baby. 
It's a boy, honey. 
He's okay for now. 
He's just real early. 
Can I hold him? 
I'm sorry, sweetheart. 
He's just too little. 
We have to take him away now. 
But... 
Name... name him John. 
Please! 
His name is John! 
Who builds a cabin in the middle of the jungle anyway? 
That's a good question. 
So? How about answering it? 
I don't know. 
And why are we even going there? 
Because hopefully, the man who lives in the cabin can tell us what to do about the people who are trying to kill us. 
We've been walking all day. 
Are we gonna get there soon? 
How long? 
I don't know. 
I've been following him. 
What? 
What do you mean, you've been following him? 
I'm not even in front. 
I have no idea where the cabin is. 
Hugo's the last one who saw it. 
Oh, this is just awesome. 
What do you think we should do, John? 
We're making camp. 
At? 
Here in the dark with the monster and... 
Him? 
Well, the rest will do us good. 
Dude, what's gonna happen when those freighter guys come back? 
I don't know... 
Yet. 
Desmond. 
The helicopter's here. 
All right, get him on the litter. 
Careful with him! 
Get him down over there. 
Be careful. 
Okay, guys, unload it. 
Come on. Pick it up. 
Pick it up. Let's go. 
What did this to him? 
A black pillar of smoke threw him 50 feet in the air... 
Ripped his guts out. 
What? 
I need you to tell me exactly how many people are on that island and where every single one of them is. 
And why would I do that? 
Keamy! 
What the hell do you think you're doing, mate? 
You gave me up. 
What? 
Linus knew who I was. 
He knew my name. 
He knew everything about me. 
No, I'm not the one who gave you up. 
Then who did? 
Do you know who I am? 
What? 
My name. 
Do you know my name? 
Keamy. 
Martin Keamy. 
Did you give it to him? 
Who? 
Benjamin Linus... 
did you give him my name? 
Wait. Wait! 
Martin, no! 
Martin, we need him. 
He's the only one who can fix the engines. 
And what makes you so sure about that? 
Because he's the one who broke them. 
Hello there. 
Who are you? 
I'm Horace. 
And what are you doing out here? 
Oh, building a place... 
a little getaway for me and the missus. 
No, I mean, sometimes you need a break from the D. I., you know? 
The Dharma Initiative? 
I'm not making any sense, am I? 
No. 
That's probably because I've been dead for 12 years. 
Hello there. 
You gotta find me, John. 
You gotta find me. 
And when you do, you'll find him. 
Who? 
Jacob. 
He's been waiting for you a real long time, man. 
I'm Horace. 
Godspeed, John. 
Hugo. 
Wake up, Hugo. 
What? 
Time to get up. 
We're gonna get going. 
I thought we didn't know where we're going, dude. 
We do now. 
I used to have dreams. 
Hi, Emily. 
Mrs. Locke, it's good to see you. 
How is he? 
He's amazing. 
He's the youngest preemie to ever survive in this hospital. 
He's had infections, pneumonia, you name it. 
And every time, he knocked them out. 
He is a fighter, your little John. 
That's wonderful. 
The other girls say he's a miracle baby. 
And today, we're gonna take him out of the incubator so you can hold him for the very first time. 
I... 
I can't do this. 
I'm sorry. 
I can't! 
So who do I talk to about adoption? 
You can't smoke in here, Mrs. Locke. 
Of course. 
I'm sorry. 
Is that the father? 
I don't know who that is. 
Can I ask you somethin'? 
Sure. 
Why am I here, man? 
You're here because you can see the cabin, and that makes you special. 
Well, I have a theory as to why we're the only ones who can see it. 
I'd love to hear it. 
I think we can see it'cause we're the craziest. 
So how'd you figure out where it was, dude? 
I didn't. 
We're not going to the cabin. 
We're gonna make a pit stop first. 
Pit stop? 
Where? 
You ever wonder what happened to the Dharma Initiative, Hugo? 
There must have been at least a hundred of' em living on this island... manning the stations, building those homes, making all that ranch dressing that you like. 
And then one day, they're all gone. 
They just disappeared. 
You want to know where we're going? 
We're going to see them. 
What happened to' em? 
He did. 
That game's stupid. 
He's right in here. 
Come on in. 
Melissa, stop that! 
Co on now. Take your brother in the kitchen. 
There's someone here who wants to see John. 
It is coming down like cats and dogs out there. 
This nice gentleman wants to talk to you, John. 
So I want you on your best behavior. 
Understand? 
He's all yours. 
You like backgammon? 
You seem to have a pretty good sense of the game. 
I'm Richard, John. 
I run a school for kids who are... extremely special, and I have reason to believe that you might be one of them. 
      Mind if I show you a couple of really neat things? 
Did you draw that, John? 
I want you to look at these things... and think about' em. 
Okay, now tell me, John, which of these things belong to you? 
T... to keep? 
No, no, John. 
Which of these things belong to you already? 
Are you sure the knife belongs to you, John? 
You sure about that? 
Well, it doesn't. 
How did he do? 
I'm afraid John isn't quite ready for our school. 
I'm sorry I've wasted your time. 
What did you do? 
What's he doing down there? 
So... this is where you shot Locke and left him for dead, huh? 
Yes, Hugo, I was standing right where you are now when I pulled the trigger. 
Should have realized at the time that it was pointless, but... 
I really wasn't thinking clearly. 
Is that why you killed all these people, too? 
I didn't kill them. 
Well, if the others didn't wipe out the Dharma Initiative... they did wipe them out, Hugo, but it wasn't my decision. 
Then whose was it? 
Their leader's. 
But I thought you were their leader. 
Not always. 
The cabin? 
He was building it. 
Did you find what you were looking for? 
Yes, Hugo. 
I believe I did. 
I need your key. 
What? 
Captain. 
Mayhew just died. 
Doc couldn't do anything for him. 
The crew's asking a lot of questions about what happened to you guys over there. 
You tell the crew that I'm dealing with it. 
Then you can go gas up the chopper, Frank. 
We're going back. 
Going back? 
- What the hell for? 
- Gas up the chopper, Frank. 
Okay. 
Listen, Martin. 
While you were gone, there was some sort of a sickness. 
The crew... they've been exhibiting some very strange behavior. 
Regina threw herself overboard, for god sake. 
Now I would be derelict in my duty if I didn't point out that this might be exactly what's happening to you. 
I appreciate your concern. 
Give me your key. 
That's not the protocol... 
Thank you. 
The reason there are two keys is we're only supposed to open the safe together. 
You're here, aren't you? 
What is that? 
It's the secondary protocol. 
What does it say? 
It says where Linus is going. 
How would Mr. Widmore know that? 
'Cause he's a very smart man, and if Linus knows that we're gonna torch the island, there's only one place that he can go. 
What do you mean," torch the island"? 
That was not the agreement. 
I agreed to ferry you here for an extraction mission. 
Fix my gun. 
The injured man... 
There was no gunshot. 
What do you think happened to him? 
I don't know. 
But when they go back, they'll be certain doesn't happen again. 
Omar! 
Keamy wants you in the armory. 
He said I wasn't supposed to let those two out of my sight. 
I'll watch them. 
Go. 
There's a pantry below our galley with enough room for two men. 
I've left you a supply of food and water. 
You need to go there. 
Michael... is he dead? 
No, but not for lack of bloody trying, which is precisely why you two need to be hiding before Keamy comes back on this deck. 
Hiding is pointless. 
Give us your zodiac raft so we can start ferrying people back here from the beach. 
The only way to save our lives is to get our people off that island. 
Meet me behind the container in ten minutes. 
The boat will be in the water. 
The cabin's here. 
I came from over there. 
Up the coast. 
Here you go. 
Drink up, dude. 
Digging through dead bodies takes it out of you. 
It's gonna be dark soon, Hugo. 
If you head that way, you'll hit the coast, and all you have to do is take it north until you reach our beach. 
Uh, what? 
I forced you to come with us at gun point, and I'm sorry, 
Hugo, but I was led to believe that we needed you to find this place. 
Oh, I get it. 
Now you got your magic map, you don't... you don't need me anymore. 
I'm offering you a chance to leave. 
I don't want to put you in harm's way against your will. 
And you think walking through the jungle at night by myself is gonna be any safer? 
I'm not sure it is. 
I think I'll stick with you guys. 
This way? 
What? 
He actually thinks staying was his idea. 
Not bad, John. 
Not bad at all. 
I'm not you. 
You're certainly not. 
Somebody, let me out! 
Please let me out. 
- Please, somebody, let me... 
- John, you okay? 
I'm fine. 
I'm fine. 
Get to class, ladies. 
Tardy bell just rang. 
John, you're bleeding. 
Come on. 
Let's go to the nurse's office. 
- You wanna talk about it? 
- No. 
I know you're probably upset right now, but I do have some exciting news for you. 
I got a call from Portland recently. 
There's a company up there doing some very exciting things in chemistry and new technologies. 
They're called Mittelos laboratories. 
I spoke with a Dr. Alpert. 
He's very interested in finding young, bright minds to enter in these new fields of science. 
They want you to go to their camp this summer. 
Science camp? 
Yes. 
Don't you understand that things like science camp are the reason why I get stuffed into lockers? 
- John, this is a great opportunity. 
- How do they even know about me? 
Well, they must have sent a rep to the science fair... your display at Costa Mesa. 
I'm not a scientist! 
I like boxing and fishing and cars. 
I like sports! 
I'm gonna tell you something... something I wish someone had told me at your age. 
You might not want to be that guy in the labs surrounded by test tubes and beakers, but that's who you are, John. 
You can't be the prom king. 
You can't be the quarterback. 
You can't be a superhero. 
Don't tell me what I can't do. 
Why didn't you tell me? 
Tell you what? 
That you're a survivor of 815. 
'Cause you wouldn't have believed me. 
You didn't think I'd believe you? 
I tell you that I'm one of the only people in the world that think that that plane on the bottom of the ocean is a hoax, and you didn't think I'd believe you? 
I didn't know if I could trust you. 
Your boss put that plane there. 
Man, I thought I was Mr. Conspiracy, but you got me beat there. 
Listen to me. 
Listen to me. 
You can't fly that guy back... 
Keamy. 
You let me worry about Keamy, all right? 
You can't fly him back! 
He is gonna kill everyone on that island. 
Everyone. 
And you don't want that on your conscience, man. 
Trust me. 
Hey, boss. 
Just getting him down to the engine room. 
Stay on a heading of exactly 3-0-5. 
Faraday says that's the only safe way to and from the boat. 
What will you tell Keamy if he notices the zodiac is missing? 
I'll tell him you stole it. 
Now go. 
Desmond. 
I can't go with you. 
Why not? 
I've been on that island for three years. 
I'm never setting foot on it again... 
Not when Penny's coming for me. 
I'll be back with the first group as soon as I can. 
Stay on that bearing, yeah? 
I will. 
You need to go now. 
It should be about 200 yards this way. 
You sure it's gonna be there, John? 
I'm sorry? 
The cabin... 
what if it's moved again? 
It hasn't moved because I was told that this is where it would be. 
I was told a lot of things, too... 
that I was chosen, that I was special. 
I end up with a tumor on my spine and my daughter's blood all over my hands. 
I'm sorry those things happened to you, Ben. 
Those things had to happen to me. 
That was my destiny. 
But you'll understand soon enough that there are consequences to being chosen... 
Because, destiny, John, is a fickle bitch. 
Guys? 
Cabin. 
Okay, okay, okay. 
Good job, man. 
Okay, we'll try it some more tomorrow. 
He's all yours. 
Come on up. 
It's all right. 
Come on. 
Don't give up, Mr. Locke. 
Excuse me? 
I'm just saying, don't give up. 
Anything's possible. 
You should read my file. 
My spine was crushed. 
There's a 98 % chance I'll never get any feeling back in my legs. 
- So I don't know why I'm even trying to... 
- As a matter of fact, I did read your file. 
You survived falling eight stories out of a building. 
That's a miracle, Mr. Locke. 
Let me ask you something. 
Do you believe in miracles? 
No. 
I don't believe in miracles. 
You should. 
I had one happen to me. 
Hey, look. I just want to go back to my room. 
You know what you need, Mr. Locke? 
You need to go on a walkabout. 
Wha... what's a walkabout? 
It's a journey of self-discovery. 
You go out into the Australian outback with nothing more than a knife and your wits. 
I can't" walkabout" anything. 
In case you haven't noticed, I'm a cripple. 
Is that what you are, Mr. Locke? 
I went on my walkabout convinced I was one thing, but I came back another. 
I found out what I was made of, who I was. 
And here you are, an orderly. 
Oh, I'm a lot more than just an orderly, John. 
When you're ready, Mr. Locke... 
You'll listen to what I'm saying. 
And then when you and me run into each other again... 
You'll owe me one. 
Hey, doc. Wanna hear something weird? 
Yeah, sure. 
You know that Morse code message that I got from the beach? 
It said that the doctor washed up on the shore with his throat slit. 
But I'm the doctor. 
Crazy, right? 
Everything here? 
Yes, sir. 
Good. 
Get it packed up. 
What are you gonna do with all that? 
Fire her up, Frank. 
Mr. Keamy, I was hired to fly scientists. 
Get your ass in the cockpit and fire up the chopper, Frank. 
I'm not taking you. 
I'll kill you, Frank. 
Yeah, well, you do that, you'll never get back to the island'cause I'm the only pilot you got. 
Sorry, doc. 
That changes anything, Frank? Huh? 
Another 30 seconds goes by and someone else's turn... 
I fixed your gun. 
Now stand down, martin, or I will fire. 
I don't think you want to do that, captain. 
What's that on his arm? 
What's that on his arm? 
What'll it be, Frank? 
We're flying. 
Come on. Let's go, boys. 
Come on! 
Let's go! 
Thanks, captain. 
Come on! Come on! Come on! 
Let's go! 
Hey! What did I say to you? 
You told me not to leave my tent. 
I was hungry. 
Jack, you have to rest. 
You can't run around. 
I know that it is hard for you to ask for help, but if you tear your stitches... 
Okay. 
Okay. 
I got it. 
Doctors make the worst patients. 
Jack! 
I think they want us to follow' em. 
All right. 
Let's do this. 
I'm not going in there with you. 
What? 
The island wanted me to get sick, and it wanted you to get well. 
My time is over, John. 
It's yours now. 
Yeah, I'm cool with you going in alone, too. 
Good luck, John. 
Are you Jacob? 
No. 
But I can speak on his behalf. 
Well, who are you? 
I'm Christian. 
You know why I'm here? 
Yeah, sure. 
Do you? 
I'm here... 
Because I was chosen to be. 
That's absolutely right. 
Claire? 
Hi, John. 
What are you doing here? 
Don't worry. 
I'm fine. 
I'm with him. 
Wh... where's the baby? 
The baby's where he's supposed to be, and that's not here. 
It's probably best that you don't tell anyone that you saw her. 
Why? 
Why is she... 
we don't have time for this. 
The people from the boat are already on their way back, and once they get here, all of these questions won't matter one bit. 
So why don't you ask the one question that does matter? 
How do I save the island? 
Did he tell you what we're supposed to do? 
He did. 
Well? 
He wants us to move the island. 
Previously on" lost"... 
You killed naomi! 
She wants her people to come here. 
And trust me, when they do, we had better be far away from here. 
If you want to live, you need to come with me. 
who are you? 
Daniel faraday. 
I'm here trescue you. 
so this is the team? 
These are the wrong people for a mission like this. 
None of them have field experience, military training. 
You can't just drop them in unprotected. 
There's only so much I can do. 
Where's the chopper? 
Where did it crash? 
crash? 
The hell kind of pilot you think I am? 
I put her down safe and sound right over there. 
Get up. 
You're coming with us. 
Well, we need to stay where we are so that they can find us. 
See, there's your problem. 
We don't want to be found. 
You wanted to know why we're here? 
I'll tell you why we're here. 
We're here for benjamin linus. 
Now where is he? 
did ben ever mention anything about knowing anyone off the island? 
- You're sure of that? 
- No. 
Look, this is real simple. 
do you know where he is or don't you? 
What do you want with him? 
I wanna locate him. 
The people who hired me told me his name's benjamin linus. 
They gave me this picture, and that's all they told me. 
They said," find him." 
And for what they're paying me, I don't need to know anything else. Do you? 
you want ben? 
Okay, he's with locke and your friend... 
- charlotte. 
- Charlotte. 
Locke's got her, too, and we know where he's heading. 
Locke's the guy that killed naomi? 
Give me back my gun, shephard. 
You want your gun back. 
I want answers. 
You don't trust me. 
{ 6 } N.I'll always be with you.R.G. I don't trust you. 
In fact, you're supposed to be dead. 
But am I asking a billion questions? 
No. 
We both have the same problem- - this locke guy. 
Even if locke has your friend, you can't just waltz in there and grab her. 
They're armed. 
Well, how about that? 
So are we. 
- So why don't we move out and - - you're not going anywhere. 
Will that helicopter fly? 
It's what she does. 
Then you can take me to your ship. 
Sayid, wait a second. 
We did call these people to get us off this island, didn't we? 
Well? 
I burned a lot of fuel cong in. I can't carry much weight. 
I'll take three of ya. 
In case you zoned out while you were tweezing your goatee, one of these yahoos took charlotte prisoner. 
I can bring her back safely. 
And if I do... will you take me to the ship? 
Absolutely. 
You bring charlotte back safe, and I will take you off this island. 
good morning. 
Good morning. 
It's a long walk to the next hole. 
Do you need a ride? 
Thank you, but no. 
My ball is right here. 
You know, you are the first person I've seen out here all morning. 
I believe we're paying quite a premium for that kind of privacy. 
Indeed we are. 
Is this your first time in the seychelles? 
I'd use the 5-iron. 
I think I'll stick with the 7. 
Tell you what. 
50 euros ss mine goes closer to the pin with a 5. 
Let's make it 100. 
Eccellente. 
Amazing, huh, how a wager makes just about anything more fun? 
not bad. 
Not bad. 
so... what do you do for a living, my friend? 
I do nothing. 
" Nothing" doesn't pay for a vacation here. 
I was the recipient of a large settlement. 
Corporate merger? 
Actually, a plane crash. 
Oceanic airlines flight 8-1-5. 
I'm sayid jarrah. 
One of the oceanic six. 
Ah, that'S... that's--that's amazing. 
I remember reading all about it. 
Take your shot, my friend. 
it appears you were right about the 5-iron. 
Well, uh... enjoy your round, and, uh, don't worry about the wager. 
All in good fun. 
No, you won. 
Low me to pay you. 
It's fine, thank you. It'S... 
I insist, mr. 
Avellino. 
Lost Season04 Episode03 
Is this seat free? 
Where would you like to go? 
" is it free?" Was the full extent of my german. 
what are you looking for? 
I love europe. 
Everyone speaks english. 
I'm looking for potsdamer platz. 
Well, you don't need aap. 
It's one block down, right across the street. 
Thank you. 
I'm elsa. 
Sayid. 
could I have an espresso, please? 
What sort of business brings you to berlin? 
I'm a headhunter. 
A corporate recruiter. 
And what do you do? 
My employer an economist. 
He works in emerging markets. 
Actually, I-I don't really understand what he does, which doesn't matter since all I do is shop for him. 
And if this goes off, I'm at his side instantly, which is wonderful since he's only in berlin once or twice a year. 
Which is why you're enjoying a luxuriously long miay coffee. 
Yes. 
Thank you. 
do I... know you from somewhere? 
I'll tell you exactly where you know me from... if you let me take you to dinner. 
this is the restaurant you're taking me to tonight. 
8 : 00. 
Well... if you can find it. 
hello? 
- I made contact. 
- Good. 
take a look at this. 
Naomi had it with her. 
She was looking fodesmond. 
Whatever their real agenda is, it's clear they're not sharing it. 
Maybe desmond can shed some light on this. 
How long would it take to get to the beach and back? 
Couple of hours. 
You mind? 
Anything i can do to help. 
sad. 
So how we gonna do this? 
You're not the best candidate for this kind of mission. 
Well, and what kind of mission is that? 
I'm going to make locke release charlotte, and I'm going to do it without any bloodshed. 
As opposed to the way I'd do it? 
The last time you encountered him, you put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. 
That's not good diplomacy. 
Jarrah. 
You think you're going after charlotte without me? 
Of course not. 
Well, good. 
Is tre anything else? 
Yeah. Givee my gun back. 
We leave in ten minutes. 
Ready to give us a name, gizmo? 
He's not gonna tell you who his spy is on their boat, james. 
yeah? Why not? 
because that's the only thing that's keeping him alive. 
Well, here's an idea. 
Why don't we take a gun, point it to his big toe and send that little piggy to market? 
And if he still doesn't want to tell us, we'll move on to the roast beef. 
Now why don't we do that? 
Because then we'd have to carry him. 
Hey, john, how much further is it? 
I-I need to feed aaron. 
It should be here... the cabin. 
Maybe we got turned around. 
It could be anywhere. 
No, it was here. 
Well, what's in this cabin that's so important anyway? 
John's looking for somebody to tell him what to do next. 
I guess I was mistaken. 
It doesn'T... doesn't matter. 
Pl the same. 
We keep movin'. 
The barracks aren't far. 
If her team is with jack's group, they know we're going to the barracks. 
yeah, and red here was wearing a vest. 
Which means her posse's gonna come expecting themselves a gunfight. 
If all they want is her, maybe we should just let hero. 
I mean, I thought we were just gonna go hide. 
Why do we need to take prisoners? 
We're keeping her because she's gonna be valuable. 
How is she gonna be valuable? 
He means as a hostage, luv. 
No, this is notwhat I signed up for. 
What did you sign up for hugo? 
Look, I'm just saying I think we- - if we let her go, they'll look at it as a sign of good faith. 
They'll look at it as an act of foolishness, which is what it would be. 
I'm just trying to come up with some sort of comprose- - we're beyond compromise. 
And right now, hugo, I'm making the decision. 
Is that gonna be a problem for you? 
kinda sucks, huh? 
What's that? 
Being told not to come along. 
now you know what it feels like to be me. 
Does that mean I should wait 20 minutes and ago anyway? 
You should go with them, kate. 
- You're serious? 
- Yeah. 
What, don't you trust sayid? 
I don't trust locke. 
So what's preventing him from doing to me what he did to naomi? 
Sawyer won't let him. 
Got room for one more? 
Oh, yeah, she gets a gun. 
The gun's a last resort, kate you give locke that same speech? 
Let move out. 
This guy sayid- - where's he from? 
Iraq. 
Iraq? 
So he's just gonna go and work everything out? 
What was he, a diplomat? 
no. 
No, he was a torturer. 
Naomi- - were you close to her? 
Nope. 
Met her on the boat. 
You don't seem particularly affected by her death. 
Sure I'm affected. 
She was hot, and I dug her accent. 
Nice. 
And this woman--charlotte. 
You don't really care about her, do you? 
Define" care" 
so much for camaraderie. 
Ah, gee, who's the one going after one of their crash buddies with guns? 
Actually, I do care about locke. 
Maybe you can tell me how he managed to split your happy little family in half. 
There was a fundamental debate as to whether your people were coming to rescue us or kill us. 
And which side did you land on? 
I'll let you know when I decide. 
You look fantastic. 
this is why I wanted to take you to the opera. 
If a man can't wear his tuxedo by the fifth date, why bother? 
you know what? 
I'm not bringing it. 
If tonight's the night he calls, so be it. 
I'll carry it. 
If he does call, I don't want you fired over me. 
You should tell your employer that there is newer technology. 
Well, I've tried. 
He's very old-fashioned. 
You know how bosses can be. 
Do you have a boss? 
Everyone has a boss, lsa. 
Come on. 
We don't want to be late. 
Why are you still here? 
I mean, when we met, you said you would only be in berlin for one week. 
The job I'm ons proving harder to accomplish than I thought. 
right. 
I was hoping it was because of me. 
let's go. 
Strauss awaits. 
What's his story? 
Daniel? 
Ah, couldn't tell you. 
Half the stuff he says is way over my head. 
the other half goes way, way over. 
Hey, uh, frank? 
Can I, uh- - ooh. 
Sorry to interrupt. 
- May I please use the phone just for a second? 
- For what? 
I just wanna call regina on the boat,' cause I figure since we're waiting, maybe I could just, you know, try to- - what is it, daniel? 
I'd just like to do an experiment. 
- Just--just a - - okay. 
You just keep it to at science stuff, all right? 
Yeah. 
If minkowski gets on there, you hang up right away. 
Yeah. 
Thank you.Thank you. 
hello? 
Regina? 
Hey--hi, it's dan.Hang on. 
Can you hear me? 
Yeah. 
Yeah? Okay.Hang on. 
I am all set here. 
I have a fix. 
Are you locked in? 
Getting your signal pretty clear. 
Okay, great. 
Then... okay. 
Fire the pload. 
Payload away! 
Don't sweat it. 
He does this kind of stuff on the boat all the time. 
40 kilometers to beacon. 
35 kilometers to beacon. 
30 kilometers to beacon. 
25 kilometers to beacon. 
20 kilometers to beacon. 
15 kilometers to beacon. 
10 kilometers to beacon. 
- Regina? 
- 5 kilometers to beacon. 
I don't have it. 
That'S... weird. 
that is far more than weird. 
what's with the swing set? 
These people have day care? 
You think they're here yet? 
Let's find out. 
it'soming from in there. 
hurley, what happened? 
They left me. 
Locke's gone off the reservation, man. 
I mean, he took this one chick hostage, he said walt was the one who told him to kill this other chick, 
- and--and--and he - - walt? 
Dude, don't ask. 
I was, like, just trying to argue with him so he would just, like, you know, chill, but, uh- - how about you stop babbling, just tell us what happened to them? 
Where are they? 
Who are you? 
Where the hell did they go, tubby? 
Oh, awesome. 
The ship sent us another sawyer. 
Hurley, where did they go? 
Look, I guess they were too busy tying me up to tell me. 
I don't know. 
And so they all left, all together? 
Yeah, they were freaked. 
Locke said that the peop on the ship were here to rescue charlotte and then kill us. 
So... are you? 
Not yet. 
Did they say anything that suggested where they were going next? 
Uh, locke said they were gonna go by ben's house before they took off. 
Why would he go there? 
For all I know, they could've locked ben up in the closet, too. 
Where's ben's house? 
Mind if I ask you a question? 
Shoot. 
The red sox really win the series? 
Hey, don't get me started on that, all right? 
My dad's from the bronx. 
I bleed yankee blue. 
I can't believe it's been a hundred days since I've seen a game. 
it's the payload! 
it's finally here. 
What is that? 
It's a rocket. 
oh, no. 
31 minutes. 
Oh, no. 
This is not good. 
Your friends are back. 
well... look at that. 
Look for anything that might show where they've gone. 
I'll start in here. 
Sayid! 
Don't worry. Kate's fine. 
Good job, hugo. 
Sorry, dude. 
I'm sorry, sayid. 
Nothing personal. 
Where's locke? 
He's talking to that angry chinese guy. 
I'm not going to hurt you, hurley. 
I saw you snap that guy's neck with that break-dancing thing you do with your legs. 
I think I'll hang back here. 
well... 
I guess they're running out of jail space. 
I lost a dollar, you know. 
How'd you manage that? 
I bet john that you wouldn't be stupid enough to fall for your friend as bait. 
what do you know about friendship? 
I know it's no use having friends you can't trust. 
so, what, I'm your prisoner? 
If that sorta thing turns you on. 
What are you doing here with locke? 
I'm not with him. 
Yeah, you are, james. 
Then what are you doing with jack? 
I went with jack because I believe he can get us off this island. 
Then I guess that's the difference between us. 
I ain't lookin' to leave. 
Why not? 
'Cause I ain't got nothin' back there for me. 
And what's here that's so much better? 
Why do you wanna go back, kate? 
Seem to recall you being shuttled off to jail before we landed here. 
So if you think there's anything waitin' for you back home other than handcuffs, then you really don'know how the world works. 
I mean, look around us, freckles. 
We got roofs over our heads... electricity, showers, beds. 
How long, sawyer? 
How long do you think we can play house? 
why don't we find out? 
Iced tea. 
I thought you might be thirsty. 
I'm thirsty. 
I'm sorry about all the theatrics, but, uh, 
I didn't know how many of you there would be or whether you'd be armed. 
I had to... cor my bases. 
What have you done with miles and kate? 
Kate's with sawyer, and miles is somewhere else. 
He's fine. 
All I did was ask him some questions. 
- Did he answer any? 
- No. 
Did you have more luck with the woman you captured? 
Not particularly. 
then why don't you turn her over to me? 
And why would I do that? 
I agree that these people are liars, and they're certainly not here to rescue us. 
But if I return safely with charlotte, they'll take me to their ship. 
It's our best chance at finding out who they are and what they really want. 
Well, then, I can save you a lot of trouble, sayid, because ben says he's got a spy on the boat. 
Who? 
It's a secret. 
Forgive me, but the day I start trusting him is the day I would have sold my soul. 
Give me charlotte, allow me to do things my way, or a war is coming which we will both be powerless to stop. 
Why would I give you charlotte for nothing? 
Oh, I think you misunderstood me. 
I never expected you to give her to me for nothing. 
- should we get dressed? 
- no. 
well, we're gonna have to get out of this bed at a certain point. 
Why? 
Well, for one thing, because I know that eventually you're gonna have to go to that job of yours- - you know, the one that you never talk about. 
There's nothing to talk about. 
It's just a job. 
I know nothing about you. 
I understand you don't want to talk about the crash, what happened to you. 
But what about life now? 
What about you? 
That's what you do when you're in love, right? 
In love? 
Yeah. 
Okay. 
No more secrets. 
What do you want to know? 
he's here... my boss. 
I, um... 
I have to go. 
Now?

hotel adlon. 
Where's my dress? 
Elsa? 
You have to leave berlin. 
what? 
You can't be here anymore. 
what do you mean? 
Why would I- - people will be asking questions soon about what happened to your employer. 
And you can't be around to answer them. 
My employer? 
This... this is about my boss? 
Who are you? 
- It has nothing to do with how - - the caf? 
you meant to meet me there? 
You used me to get to my boss? 
What did you say--people will ask what happened to him? 
It's best you don't know. 
You're gonna kill him? 
You're gonna kill him? 
do you even know him? 
His na is on a list. 
A list? 
What list? 
You--you have a list? 
It's my employer'S. 
Who that? 
It doesn't matter who he is! 
Soou just kill people' cause your list? 
Innocent people? 
The man you are working for is not an economist. 
You were supposed to page me at ten-thirty 
No, I don't kill him 
He's not going to give me the name now 
Why should I keep him alive? 
No, He had no idea 
All right, all right 
I'll bring him to you 
Leave the hotel 
I'll meet you at the safe house 
what do u think you're- - 
* * * * * * * * 
Why was naomi carrying this picture of me? 
Look, man, you gotta understand somethin'. 
She was senior management. 
It's not like we hung around the cafeteria together. 
She stayed on her own- - look, naomi told me yopeople were hired by her. 
So you look me right in the eye and tell me u've never seen or heard of penelope widmore. 
fine. 
You don't want to tell me the truth? 
I'll find someone who will. 
See, when that takes off, I'm on it. 
He's back. 
Where's kate? 
She decided to stay. 
what happened to miles? 
I traded him. 
Traded him? 
I promised you charlotte. 
Here she is. 
You cheated. 
Did I? 
Yes, you did. 
Lucky for you, that guy's nothing but a pain in my ass. 
- You all right? 
- All right, that giveus room for one more. 
Charlotte? 
go back, with all the fun I'm having here? 
No. 
I've got work to do. 
Seat's yours if you want it, daniel. 
I--no, thank you. 
I think I should probably just stay with charlotte. 
All rit. 
Frank. Frank? 
Just--just... just one thing. 
just be sure that you follow the same exact bearing that we came in on, okay? 
No matter what. 
By that, I mean no matter what. 
Just... just stay on it. 
Roger that. 
Be careful. 
I don't have to talk you out of coming. 
As much as I like helicopter rides, I think you got this one under control. 
Wish me luck. 
Good luck. 
Send me a postcard. 
You said we have room for one more? 
Yeah. Why? 
You should bring naomi home. 
take your shirt off. 
is she dead? 
Yes. 
Why didn't she kill you? 
she was trying to get information from me. 
What sort of information? 
She wanted to know who I worked for. 
She wanted to know about you. 
Of course she did. 
Why are you crying? 
Because it hurts, or because you were stupid enough to care for her? 
These people don't deserve our sympathies. 
Need I remind you what they did the last time you thought with your heart instead of your gun? 
You used that to recruit me to killing for you. 
You wanna protect your friends or not, sayid? 
I have another name for you. 
But they know I'm after them now. 
Good. 
These are the last two eggs. 
From my own bookshelf? 
Help you pass the time. 
I've already read it. 
You might catch something you missed the second time around. 
Why did you move me from the rec room down here? 
I wanted you under my own roof. 
Where are you keeping your other prisoner? 
Miles, is it? 
Oh, you don't want to share. 
Actually, I was hoping you would share, ben, Seeing as you claim to have a spy on his ship. 
I feel for you, john. I really do. 
You keep hitting dead ends. 
You couldn't find the cabin. 
You can't make contact with jacob. 
You're so desperate to figure out what to do next, You're even asking me for help. 
So here we are, just like old times... 
Except I'm locked in a different room. 
And you're more lost than you ever were. 
I know what you're trying to do. 
It's not gonnaorK. 
Excellent, john. 
You're evolving.

It's Locke. 
Mornin', ladies. 
Good morning. 
Mornin'. 
Mmm, coffee smells good.

Kinda weird, ain't it? 
Sittin' on porches, drinking coffee out of mugs. 
Anyway, I found some clothes about your size. 
Hung' em in a closet. 
So after I kick out hugo... 
I'm not moving in with you, james. 
Well... then why did you stay? 
That's none of your business. 
Oh, you got a secret agenda, huh? 
Well, if you're spying for jack - 
I'm not spying for anyone. 
- So why don't you tell me - 
- Because I don't trust you. 
This is about the pregnancy thing.

Lost Season04 Episode04 
Albuquer-Que? 
Too hot. 
New York? 
Too many people. 
More than Seoul? 
What's wrong with Seoul? 
Sun, we're going to leave this island any moment now. 
I learn English... 
For you... 
To live... in... 
America. 
I want... 
To raise my baby at home. 
In Korea 
You mean our baby. 
Hey, look! 
Jack! 
- Jack! 
- You'rekay! 
This is, uh, charlotte and dan. 
Their helicopter already took Sayid and Desmond back to their freighter. 
They can make arrangements to get all of us off this island. 
Where's kate? 
She stayed with locke. 
Hello, kate. 
Is that blood? 
I just... killed a chicken. 
What can I do for ya? 
I wanna talk to miles. 
Where you keeping him? 
Why do you need to talk to him? 
Well, that's personal. 
No. 
And what gives you the right to decide whether or not ¡ ª 
You may think this is a democracy, kate, because of the way jack ran things. 
But this is not a democracy. 
Then I guess that makes it a dictatorship. 
If I was a dictator, I would just shoot you and go about my day. 
Dinner's at 6 : 00 if you're hungry. 
Hey, hurley! 
Wait. 
- You bringing that to miles? 
- Yeah. 
- Yeah, locke asked me to do it. 
- Cool. 
That dude creeps me out. 
He's still in the rec room, right? 
No, I moved him to the boathouse that... 
You just totally scooby-Doo'd me, didn't you? 
Sorry. 
You're not gonna let him go, are ya? 
No. 
No, I promise. 
Just don't tell locke it was me. 
So the arab traded you, too, huh? 
Do you know who I am? 
Excuse me? 
Do you know who I am? 
Do you know what I did? 
What did you do? 
Answer the question. 
Okay. 
I'll tell you what you want to know, but you gotta do something for me first. 
I'm not letting you go. 
I don't want to be let go. 
I am exactly where I want to be. 
What i want... 
Is one minute... of someone's time. 
You bring him to me, and I will tell you everything I know about you. 
Who? 
Who do you think? 
You okay? 
Yeah, I'm fine. 
Listen, the D.A.' S decided to try this case herself, 
Which means they're gonna do e full court press, 
And we need to start talking about cutting a deal. 
What kind of deal? 
Honestly, my best gus, I'd say she'll take a 15-Year sentence, and you serve seven. 
No way. 
If you go torial, kate, you're looking at 20 years on each count, 
Not to mention a life sentence on the murder charge. 
No. 
Kate, you confessed toour mother that you killed your father, 
And now she's their star witness. 
So you tell me - What am I supposed to do? 
How am I supposed to win this thing? 
Put me on thstand. 
And take a chance with the D.A. Crossing you? 
Way I see it, we've got one shot at this. 
What's that? 
We make it about character, not about what you did or didn't do, 
But about who you are. 
What do you mean, who I am? 
I want him in the courtroom. 
Absolutely not. 
We need him, kate. 
It'll generate tremendous sympathy. 
Duncan, listen to me. 
You are not bringing him in here. 
All right, you wanna make this about me, about my character? 
Fine. 
But you are not using my son. 
Maybe we should try a number other than the boat, like... 9-1-1. 
What's wrong? 
Nothing. 
We're just having some trouble getting ahold of their boat. 
You haven't heard from sayid? 
You said they lete yesrday. 
And I'm sure they're fine. 
What if locke was right? 
What if these people are here to hurt us? 
Locke has no idea whatdoe's ing. 
Then why is kate with him? 
You sure he's got ben in his basement? 
I saw rousseau take him in there last night. 
Does locke ever go out? 
No. 
He's been in there cooking all day. 
He invited us all over for dinner. 
Oh, can you get aaronfor me? 
Just pick him up and rock him a little bit. 
Yeah, I'm just... 
Not very good with babies. 
I wouldn't want him to get more upset. 
Here, I got him. 
It's okay. 
Here we go, muffin. 
Yeah. There we go. 
You're so good with him. 
What? 
Just the last thing I ever thought I'd be good at is being a mum. 
You know, you should try it sometime. 
Hey, aaron. Come on, sweetie. 
Please rise. 
Court is now in session. 
Please be seated. 
Don't fire me, okay? 
What? 
We got killed in the opening. 
I had to do this. 
Does the defense have a witness? 
Yes, we do, your honor. 
The defense calls dr. 
Jack shepherd to the witness stand. 
Your honor, I'd like to renew my objection to this witness on the basis of relevance. 
And I'm going to renew my overruling of your objection. 
You are to be aware that this witness did not meet the defendant 
Until after the alleged crimes she is being charged with. 
He's to be viewed as a character witness only. 
Proceed. 
Please raise your right hand. 
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, 
And nothing but the truth so help you god? 
Yes. 
Dr. Shephard... 
Could you please tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury ¡ ª 
If there are any of you who don't read newspapers or the internet or watch television... 
How you met the defendant? 
On september 22,2004, kate... 
Miss austen and i were both passengers on oceanic flight 815, 
Which crash-Landed on an island in the south pacific. 
Were you aware that miss austen was a fugitive being transported 
By a united states marshal on that flight to los angeles for trial? 
I did learn that eventually, yes. 
From the U.S. Marshal? 
No, the marshal died in the crash. 
Uh, I never spoke to him. 
Miss austen told me. 
Did you ever ask her if she was guilty? 
No. Never. 
Well, it seems like a reasonable question. 
Why not? 
I just assumed that there'd been some kind of mistake. 
And why would you think that? 
Only eight of us survived the crash. 
We landed in the water. 
I was hurt pretty badly. 
In fact, if it weren't for her, I would have never made it to the shore. 
She took care of me. 
She took care of all of us. She - 
She gave us first aid, water, found food, made shelter. 
- She tried to save the other two, but they didn't - 
- Stop. 
Miss austen, please sit down. 
This has nothing to do with... with anything. 
This is my trial, and I don't want him to say anything else. 
It's fine. 
I have no more questions, your honor. 
Miss dunbrook, your witness. 
That was very moving, dr. 
Shephard. 
I only have one question for you 
- Do you love the defendant? 
Objection. 
You opened this door, mr. 
Forrester. 
M going to allow it. 
Dr. Shephard? 
Do you love miss austen? 
No. 
Not anymore. 
So... what do you want to watch -" Xanadu" or" satan's doom"? 
I'm reading. 
- Turn that thing down, damn it. 
- Sorry. 
Can I come in? 
Sure. 
I believe you know my roommate. 
- Hi, hurley. 
- Hey, kate. 
Got somethin' in yr eye, hugo? 
Why don't we talk in the kitchen? 
I know it's in a box, but, uh... 
It's pretty damn good wine. 
I tested it. 
So how's the life at casa de claire? 
Baby aaron keeping you up all night? 
No. No, he's a good sleeper. 
Good for you. 
You are terrible at this, freckles. 
Terrible at what? 
You already said you didn't stay behind for me. 
So at least be woman enough to tell me you wanna use me for somethin'. 
I wanna use you for somethin'. 
See? 
Wasn't that hard. 
For what? 
For ben. 
I want you to help me bust him out. 
Y wanna play se backgammon? 
You're on. 
Do you think I know what I'm doing? 
Do you... 
Regret following me out here, or are ya worried about what we should do next? 
All I know is I'd be a lot more worried if I was sting' on that beach. 
And the rest of thgroup - What are they saying? 
I think they're saying," baa." 
That's the nice thing about sheep. 
They're predictable. 
But I ain't so sure about kate. 
What do yomean? 
I need your word you ain't gonna do nothin' to her. 
- Why would I do anything to her? 
- Just give me your word, john. 
You know what? 
Forget it. 
No, no. No. 
All right. 
You have my word. 
She came to me about an hour ago, 
Said she wanted my help busting ben out of your basement. 
Why? 
She talked to that guy... 
Bruce lee from the freighter - The guy you got locked up. 
He told her toring ben down to him for a chat. 
No, that's impossible. 
She doesn't even know where miles is. 
What? 
The boathouse down by the dock? 
If hugo knows, everybody knows. 
Are you sure about this? 
Yeah, I'm sure. 
Where you going with that? 
Atever miles has to say to ben, he can say to me. 
Son of a bitch. 
Come on. 
You got one minute. Go. 
How about some privacy? 
55 seconds. 
You know who I am? 
Yes. 
You know who I work for? 
Yes. 
Then you know he's put a lot of time and energy into finding you. 
So now i found you, and I can tell him exactly where you are. 
Or I can lie and tell him you were already dead. 
And I'd be willing to do that for $ 3.2 million. 
You've arranged this meeting so you could blackmail me? 
It's extortion, if you wanna get technical. 
3.2? 
Well, why not 3.3 or 3.4? 
What makes you think I have access to that kind of money? 
Do not treat me like I'm one of them, 
Like I don't know who you are and what you can do. 
Your friend charlotte has seen me. 
She knows I'm alive. 
I'll take care of charlotte. 
You just worry about getting me the money. 
You have two days. 
My present situation is a little bit restried. 
Can that be amended? 
Okay. 
- One week, in cash. 
- Time's up. 
- Don't even think about - 
- I said time's up! 
Ooh, this is hot. 
You got your meeting. 
Now I want my answer. 
We got your name when you called the freighter. 
Of course, we know about you and everybody else on the 815 manifest. 
Then prove it. 
Your name is katherine anne austen. 
You're wanted for murder, fraud, arson, a whole bunch of other stuff I can't remember. 
You're a fugitive, got caught in Australia, and the feds will bring you back. 
So, yeah, we know. 
If I were you, I'd stay right here on the island. 
Who knows? 
Maybe you didn't survive the crash. 
Come on. 
Go back to your house, kate. 
John, this has nothing to do with you - 
Go back to your house, kate! 
You okay? 
I couldn't sleep. 
Yeah. 
The beds take a little getting used to. 
I didn't wake aaron, did I? 
No, aaron was born on this island. 
He can sleep through anything. 
John? 
What are you doing? 
I'd like A... a moment alone with kate. 
Would you excuse us, please, claire? 
It's okay. 
John, I - 
I don't need to know why you did what you did. 
Kate, I just need to know what they said to each other. 
Miles told ben th he would lie to the people he works for on the boat, 
Tell them that ben was dead, for $ 3.2 million. 
Listen, john, I'm sorry. 
I asked you where he was - 
You're not welcome here anymore. 
I want you gone by morning. 
I rked it out so you two can have a few minutes of privacy. 
I don't need any privacy. 
You need to talk to her, kate. 
I'll boutside. 
Hello, katherine. 
Was it true, what he said? Dr. Shephard 
- That you're a hero. 
Why won't you talk to me? 
Because, mom, the last time i tried to talk to you, 
When you got sick, when I risked my life to see you, 
You screamed for help and called the police. 
Please. 
I don't want to fight with you, katherine. 
Why are you here? 
Because... 
I... 
It all changed when I thought you were dead. 
My doctors have given me six months to live for the last four years. 
I don't know how long I'm going to last. 
I came here to tell you that I... 
I don't want to testify against you. 
Then don'T. 
I want to see my grandson. 
You came here to make a deal? 
I just wanna meet him. 
I don't want you anywhere near him. 
We're finished. 
We're finished! 
Oh, hey, freckles. 
You okay? 
Look, I'm sorry I couldn't do nothin'. 
I wanted him to think that you fooled me, too. 
No sense in him not trusting both of us. 
He wants me gone by tomorrow. 
What, he... banished you? 
Well, I un-banish you. 
You castay right... here. 
This is my house. 
Okay, me and montezuma's house. 
You're gonna be all right. 
I'll keep you safe. 
Time. 
Okay, tell me. 
What do you remember? 
Okay, uh, queen of diamonds. 
Then we... six... of... clubs. 
And we have the red 10 of... hearts, maybe? 
It's two out of three. 
It's not bad. 
It's progress. 
Three cards, charlte. 
Is that progress? 
Hey. 
Been calling your boat all day. 
Why isn't anyone answering? 
We're here. How should we know? 
If they're not answering, then they're probably 
Now are you telling me there is only one line on that boat? 
There is another number that we're only supposed to use in emergencies. 
It's an emergency. 
Put it on speaker. 
Yeah? 
Regina, it's charlotte. 
Why are you calling me on this number? 
Minkowski wasn't answering. 
The people on the island want to talk to their friends, make sure they're all right. 
What... friends? 
They left last night. 
Frank took' em up in the helicopter. 
What do you mean, they took off? 
I thought the helicopter was with you. 
Morning. 
Listen, I don't know what you think you're doing, 
- But you're wasting your time. 
- Open your mouth. 
Open your mouth. 
Wide. 
Don't talk. Bite down. 
Bite down. 
I realize that when I tied you up in here the other day, 
I made the mistake of failing to introduce myself. 
My name is john locke, and I'm responsible for the well-Being of this island. 
Eventually, miles, you're gonna tell me who you are 
And you're gonna tell me about the people on the boat 
And you're gonna tell me why you're so interested in ben. 
In the meantime, however, you're gonna keep your mouth shut. 
I learned something yesterday. 
No useaving rules if there's no punishment for breaking' em. 
You'll be fine if you bite down on the trigger. 
Enjoy your breakfast. 
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. 
Just-Slow down. Slow. 
Oh, come on. 
It's not like we ain't never done it before. 
Yeah, I'm cool we didn't go all the way last night. 
I get it. 
You were sad. 
But, I mean, how can you resist after that well," I'll keep you safe" thing? 
No. Sawyer... just... 
What? 
What? What'd I say? 
Just... forget it. 
Oh, right. 
You still think you might be pregnant. 
I'm not worried. 
And I'm not pregnant. 
Are you sure? 
Yeah, I'm sure. 
I mean... whoo! 
Would it have been the worst thing in the world? 
Yes! 
Yes, it would've been the worst thing in the world. 
What would we have done with a baby? 
I'm going back to the beach. 
Beach? 
What, you're leavin' because of this? 
That's that? 
You crawl up in my bed one second, the next, you're just - 
Good-Bye. 
Don't make this about me, kate. 
You didn't want a baby any more than I did. 
You're just lookin' for some excuse to split, and now you got one. 
Wel that's all right, freckles. 
I ain't gonna hold it against ya. 
I'm just gonna sit right here in my comfy bed, 
Because in about a week, 
You'll find some reason to get pissed at jack and bounce right back to me. 
Miss dunbrook. 
Are the people ready to proceed? 
May we approach the bench, your honor? 
Please. 
Unfortunately, your honor, our chief witness, diane jansen, 
The mother of the defendant, is unable to testify because of medical reasons. 
How long will you need? 
I can't say right now. 
What I'll do is grant a recess for lunch, 
But be prepared to proceed with your case after we return. 
This court is now in recess. 
All rise. 
We have to talk. 
My key witness spoke to her daughter yesterday, d now she's got cold feet. 
Quit posturing, and let's get to it. 
What are you offering? 
Four years in. 
No jail time. 
Kate austen is a worldwide hero who saved five other peoples' lives after a plane crash 
And nearly starved to death on a deserted island, 
And after all that, you put this woman on trial for rescuing her mother from an abusive husband. 
If you think that jury is gonna give her actual time, then... 
You must have a hell of a closing, melissa. 
All right. 
Time served, plus 10 years' probation and agreement that she does not leave the state. 
What does that matter? 
- She can go anyw - 
- I'll take it. 
No. Wait, kate - 
Give me something to sign, and I'll sign it, 
And then I walk out the back door. 
I just... 
I just want this to be over. 
I can do that. 
10 years' probation, and you stay put. 
I have a child. 
I'm not going anywhere. 
Hey. 
How did you know I'd be here?

- But in the end everything was fine. - 
All right, we're good to go. 
You got this? 
You bet your ass, bubba. 
Let's make some money! 
Everyone in position. 
I thought we'd be robbing banks by now, not some gas truck in the middle of nowhere. 
Down here, gas is gold, bubba. 
Kill the chatter! Game time. 
I wouldn't piss him off, guys. 
Okay, guys, we're gonna have to hit this hard and fast. We got four K left before the downgrade. 
Locked and loaded! 
This is all you, Han. 
Liquid gold. 
We're clear. 
Okay, T, you're up. 
Let's see if you can get it under six tries this time, huh, T? 
It's more like three. Come on, Tego, keep it real. 
Just one K left. We're running out of road. 
Get in there, brother. I got it, I got it. 
Shit! 
Spray that hitch! 
I don't have a hammer! 
Just do it! 
Hold onto something tight! 
Letty! Give me your hand! 
I can't reach! 
Jump! 
Letty, jump! 
I've got you! 
Dom... 
Dom? 
Dom! 
Yo, why your stack is bigger than mine always? I'm supersized, baby. 
Cops just raided our garage in Baracoa. 
They were real interested in you. 
Heat's on and we just sent up a flare that's gonna lead them right to us. 
I say we move out first thing in the morning. 
Nah, it's me they want. 
And if they catch me, they're throwing big numbers at anybody with me. 
Han, we had a good run. 
Time for you to go do your own thing. 
Heard they're doing some crazy shit in Tokyo. 
Have you seen Letty? 
There she is. 
I hear Rio is nice this time of year. 
The cops are getting hungrier. 
Then I guess we're doing our job. 
I'm a walking target. 
I don't want you around when they catch up to me. 
" Ride or die," remember? 
Dom, how long have we been doing this? 
And now all of a sudden, out of nowhere, it's too dangerous? 
Come on. 
We'll figure it out. We always do. 
I don't know shit! 
Give me a name! 
Give me a name! David Park! 
David Park's the guy you want! 
Please! 
Thank God. 
Listen, he's in a mood because yesterday was his cheat day, and then today, some genius brought in donuts. Great. 
Sorry I'm late. 
Complaints keep rolling in after your little downtown Olympics, O'Conner. 
Tell me that reinstating you wasn't a mistake. 
I got a name. 
David Park. That's it? 
That's all you got? David Park? I could throw a fortune cookie out this window and hit 50 David Parks right now. 
It's Korean, not Chinese. 
Whatever. 
Park is a scout that recruits street racers to be mules for the Braga cartel. 
We find Park, and we bust the bad guys. 
Dom. 
Mia, I told you not to call me here. 
Dom, it's Letty. 
She's been murdered. 
Facial recognition software matched Toretto about 10 minutes after he crossed the border. 
I don't get it. 
I thought he'd show. 
I told you not to come. They're staking the place out. If they find you... 
They won't. 
Come on. Look at you. 
Letty wouldn't let them junk it. 
Even though it is a goddamn curse. 
When she came back, she was always in here, working on it day and night. 
It was weird. 
It was like she knew you were coming back. 
I want to see the crash site. 
I just got off the phone with Deputy Director Lawson. 
If we don't make serious inroads into the Braga case in the next 72 hours, they're gonna shut us down. 
I know I'm a newbie here, but why the clock now? 
Because it's been two years, and the last three agents we sent to infiltrate his organization came back in body bags. 
He's moved more heroin across the border than Escobar did in 10 years. 
This guy is becoming one of our biggest national threats, and we don't even have a picture of him. 
We don't have prints! 
Not even a goddamn DOB! 
What's the status on David Park? Isn't he our ticket into the Braga organization? 
We're running the name through city and county databases, sorting the possibilities. 
We've got over 500 already. 
Park's insignificant. 
Sounds like another jerk-off to me. It's not. 
Without Park, Braga wouldn't have drivers to move his shipments. 
Cross-check traffic. 
lllegal modifications. Street racing. This guy will definitely have a record. 
We better. 
What do you know? 
Your boy Toretto's red Chevelle has been spotted in his old neighborhood. 
I'm going to bring his ass in. 
It's straight ahead. 
You found something back there. 
There were burn marks on the ground. 
The kind that could only be caused by nitrometh. 
There's only one guy in all of L.A. that sells that. 
Nothing you can do is gonna bring her back, Dom. 
If I were Letty, I would ask you... 
No, I would beg you, please, let this go. 
Before it's too late. 
It's already too late. 
I love you. 
Miss Toretto. 
I'm Michael Stasiak, fbi. 
Let's you and I have a little chat. 
Hi. This is Forsythe in Evidence. 
I need Stasiak down here right away to sign some greenies. 
Hey. Okay, I narrowed it down to 50 or so David Parks. 
What I'd like you to do is run the make and model on each one of them. All right? Okay. 
Hey, Tyler, we got a transfer. 
You want to come with me? 
Toretto. 
When'd you get back in town? I'm looking for a car you did an engine mod on. 
Nitromethane tank. Ford full-size. Continental tires. 
Look, what are you doing, coming in here like this, huh? 
This ain't your scene anymore, boss. 
Don't ever put your hands on me again, okay? 
A Korean kid brought it in. 
David Park. 
It's a green Ford Torino. 
Please don't drop this on me! 
I'm almost done. 
Why don't you tell me why you dragged me here, Brian? 
You know they're going to capture Dom. 
I don't want you getting tangled up in this. 
That's what you have to say to me after five years? 
All of a sudden, you care what happens to me. 
What I did to you was wrong. I'm sorry. 
It was... 
It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. 
I'm sorry, too, Brian. 
I'm so sorry that you had to come into my home and pretend to love me. 
I'm so sorry that you ripped my family apart. 
I'm very sorry that that was hard for you. 
I lied to you. 
I lied to Dom. I lied to everybody. 
That's what I do best. It's why the Feds recruited me. 
Maybe you're lying to yourself. 
Maybe you're not the good guy pretending to be a bad guy. 
Maybe you're the bad guy pretending to be the good guy. 
You ever think about that? 
Every day. 
I always wondered, why did you let my brother go that day? 
I don't know. 
Shit. 
Brian! I got the cross-checks on David Park back and have a list of possibles. 
What do you got? All right. A 45-year-old male in a' 06 Scion with three reckless driving tickets. 
No. 
An' 01 Chevy Tahoe. 
No. 
Two Mini Coopers, a' 06 and a' 07, a Toyota hybrid. 
Hell no. A' 98 Saturn, a' 95 Sebring. 
A' 98 Nissan 240 with an illegal mod. 
Wait. 
That's it. 
What? The 240 with the illegal mod. 
How do you know? 
' Cause that's something I'd drive. 
Green Torino, running nitro. 
Whose car? 
I don't know, man. I'm just the middleman. I swear! 
Wait, wait, wait. 
I don't know shit, man. I swear. I just run cars for Braga, all right? 
All I can do is get you in the race! 
That's all I can do! 
What race? 
I told you, you got to talk to Braga! Bring him up, Dom. God! 
Bring him up. 
You here to take me in, O'Conner? 
Shit! 
Shit! 
Letty was my friend, too. 
You weren't anyone's friend. 
Yo, can you guys talk about this later? Now pull my ass up! 
She was running for this guy, Braga, and things went bad. 
Please! I'm going to get these guys, Dom. Now let me do my job and bring him up. 
I'm going to kill this Braga. 
God! And anyone else who gets in my way. 
Hey! Don't let go. 
O'Conner! 
O'Conner! 
If you ever release a witness of mine again... 
That's enough! STASIAK : 
PENNING : That's enough. 
You're through, O'Conner! I said that's enough! 
Stasiak, go get yourself cleaned up. 
What? 
He hit me first! You... This isn't the Cub Scouts! 
Now, go on! 
You're bleeding on my floor. 
O'Conner, do you know the difference between a cop and a criminal? 
What? One bad judgment call. 
Keep your shit in line, son. 
Have a good time. 
Good news. We have intel that Braga's number two, Ramon Campos, will hold a street race in Koreatown tomorrow night to fill a slot on his team. 
They've already chosen three drivers from previous races. 
Our newest informant, Mr. David Park, has been kind enough to get us into the race. 
O'Conner, you're up. 
Let me guess, winner gets the slot. 
All right, so these are all the imports the city has in impound. 
Okay, nice. Pick your poison. 
All right, 2206. 
I crashed one of those. 
3418 and 2765. 
Okay, so which one do you want? 
I want them all. 
Standard issue tracking device. 
Boss wants to know where you are at all times. 
Hey! What are you looking at, nutsack? 
I don't know. 
You tell me. The racer wants what Dwight's got. 
See, but, ladies, Dwight's already on the team. You got to be fast if you want to drive for Braga. 
Is there a problem here? No. 
You one of Park's guys, blondie? Yeah. 
Yeah, I am. 
Follow me. 
You, too, punk. 
You all know why you're here. 
Good drivers are a dime a dozen. 
Man, every corner's got a chingadera tuner racing for pinks. 
That's not what Braga has got me looking for. 
Braga wants someone that would sell their abuelita to be behind the wheel. 
Someone that drives their 10-second cars not in a straight line, but to push it and make it through places no one else would take it. 
Real drivers. 
So, what are we hauling? 
For the money Braga's paying, you don't need to know. 
You just said you wanted real drivers. 
A real driver knows exactly what's in his car. 
Mira, real driver, nobody's forcing you to race. 
You the boss? 
Or am I talking to the boss? 
Do I look like a boss? 
My job is to find the best drivers, period. 
Are we cool? 
Yeah, we're cool. 
No, we ain't cool, man. 
Who's closing these streets? 
No one. That's the point. 
six... You sure you want to do this? 
A lot has changed. 
... four... You're right. 
Right turn ahead. You are now five miles from your destination. How's my ass look, Chia Pet? 
Come on! 
Right turn ahead. Shit! 
Damn. Rerouting. Proceed straight ahead. 
You are 2.6 miles from destination. Oops, I didn't see you. 
U - turn, if possible. Are you kidding me? 
You are now 4.2 miles from your destination. 
Sorry, car. 
You are now one mile from your destination. 
Let's go! 
Nice car, baby! 
Bitch! 
You are now one-quarter mile from your destination. Too early, Dom. 
No! Still a buster. 
You have reached your destination. Goodbye. At least we know you can't beat me straight up. 
I didn't know there were any rules. 
Now that's what I call real driving. 
No, that's bullshit, man! 
Go cry to your mama, eh? 
You work for Braga now. When the GPS calls, you follow. 
Driver's license. 
What driver's license? 
Thumb. 
Cell phone number. 
The print is for Campos. The number is for me. 
Yo, nutsack! 
Let me tell you something, man, muscle beats import every time. You know what I'm saying? 
Every time! 
Dwight likes feet. Take off your shoes. 
So beautiful. 
Dwight likes this foot a lot. 
Daddy Dwight loves... fbi! 
I didn't do nothing, man! Dwight didn't do nothing! Hey, no! 
Bye, Dwight! No, what did I do? 
You're under arrest for distribution of meth. 
Meth? Dwight's never touched that shit, bro! 
Dwight has now. 
Yo, that ain't mine! 
No! You know that's never gonna stick, right? 
Yeah, it's not supposed to. 
That's too bad about Dwight. Having the Feds raid your house the same night you make the team. 
So unfortunate. I wish I could say I was surprised to see you here. 
What's to stop someone from telling them you're a cop? 
Probably the same thing that's keeping me from telling them why you're really here. 
What up, fellows? Hey, how you doing? 
Great. 
You having a good time? Yeah, a great time. 
Come on, let's have a better time. 
How's your car? It took a nasty bump. 
It'll be ready. 
I also heard you just got out of County. 
Mmm-hmm. You know a guy named Jim Garcia? 
Nah. 
Big place. 
Lots of names, lots of faces. 
And you, you're wanted by a lot of people, homes. 
Yeah, that kind of heat can't be good for business. 
Yeah, well, that depends on how you look at things. 
I go down, I do time. I do real time. 
I don't know about your other drivers, but when I see flashing lights in my mirror, 
I don't stop. 
Do you know each other? 
He used to date my sister. 
I see. 
You're a lucky man. 
You're still breathing. 
To the ladies we've loved and the ladies we've lost. 
So, what's Braga about? 
You know, he's just one of us. 
Came up from the streets. Down for el barrio. 
Now he's a shot caller. The boss of bosses. 
See all these cats in here? 
Any one of them would die for Braga. 
Including you? 
Especially me. 
Enjoy the party, fellows. Club's yours. 
Whatever you want, booze, broads, it's all good. 
Braga's mine. 
I'm taking the whole house down. 
Good luck. 
Something interests you about this car? 
Just admiring the body work. 
Are you one of those boys who prefers cars to women? 
I'm one of those boys that appreciates a fine body, regardless of the make. 
Your car? 
It's Fenix's car. 
You'll meet him at the rendezvous. He'll be leading you. 
So now that I know your taste in cars, tell me, what about your women? 
It all starts with the eyes. 
She's got to have those kind of eyes that can look right through the bullshit to the good in someone. 
20 % angel, 80 % devil. 
Down to earth. 
Ain't afraid to get a little engine grease under her fingernails. 
That doesn't sound anything like me. 
It ain't. 
Hi. Hi. I got a gift for you. 
All right. A dirty shot glass, just what I always wanted. 
I got these from the club last night. 
Run them both. I know one of these is Campos'. I think the other might be Braga's. 
And you're gonna have to go beyond Interpol. So, that means I have to contact individual agencies, and that could take weeks. 
Okay. 
Yeah. 
That's your third traffic violation in less than three blocks. 
Slow it down, O'Conner. 
Sure thing, Dad. 
He stopped. 
We lost him. He killed the tracker. 
I'm telling you, he killed the tracker. 
We don't know that yet! 
Get the bird overhead. 
All clear. 
Base, flag nine, I'm at Angels 5. I don't have a tally on the target. 
Repeat, I don't have a tally on the target. 
They're gone, there's no one down there. 
Yo! Where do you think they're taking us? 
Don't matter. 
We're all just along for the ride now. 
Welcome to Mexico, boys. 
There are helicopters and surveillance cameras that scan for heat signatures at the border. 
But there are blind spots that I can guide you through via satellite. 
There can be no margin of error, so you must follow my every direction. 
Any questions? 
I thought Fenix was gonna be here. 
He'll meet you out there. 
All right, everybody, sync up. 
Good luck, gentlemen. 
Satellite linkup engaged. 
Keep proceeding northbound at current speed. 
Stay close to Fenix. 
He'll lead you across. 
I got a heat signature northbound along Legardo Ravine. 
Thermal imaging window on the Mexico side's gonna be down for about 45 seconds. 
Get the camera on it. Manual override. 
Rerouting camera to designated coordinates. 
Hurry it up. You guys have been tagged. Shit. 
Reimaging commencing. 
I don't see anything. 
They're gone. 
Get the helicopters to cover it. 
They're sending a helicopter. 
You have 30 seconds. North 32' 33', west 116' 49'. 
The window is closing fast. You need to get out of there before they send ground support. 
Fifteen seconds. Base, target is at two miles. You're running out of time. 
Base, we're at north 32' 33', west 116' 49'. 
Sloppy! 
Very sloppy! 
What are you doing, man? 
Come on. Get out. 
Come on, man. 
Come on, today, man. Come on, let's go. 
Hey, don't touch me, man! Hey, I said don't touch me, man! 
Hey, Malik, chill, bro. 
Yo, man, what's up with your boy? 
Hey, boss man! 
What did you say? 
I said only pussies run nitrometh. 
You looked under my hood? 
I'm talking to you. 
Got something on your mind? 
'70 Plymouth. Her name was Letty. 
And somebody wrecked her car. 
I wrecked her car. 
You remember her face? 
'Cause I don't. 
Last time I saw it, it was burning. 
Now what? 
I'm going to enjoy what happens next. 
Dom, get in! 
Get in! Come on! 
Come on! Get in the fucking car! 
Let's go! 
What have you got, Trinh? 
We're contacting agencies in multiple countries. 
Unfortunately, most of them have to manually scan their prints for us to upload. 
O'Conner's on line five. 
And, sir, you should see this. 
Thank you. 
Talk to me, O'Conner. 
Where the hell have you been? 
I got the shipment. 
" I got the shipment," or" we got the shipment"? 
What are you talking about? Traffic cams in the area picked up pictures of you and Toretto together. 
Listen to me, O'Conner. 
Bring in the shipment and bring in Toretto. 
But I thought the point was to get Braga. We got an opportunity here. 
Brian, the clock stopped ticking. 
Bring them in. Are we clear? 
So this is what $ 60 million looks like. 
Yeah, we got to get you to a doctor. 
We got to find a place to hide this. 
I got a spot. 
502, wet reckless. I need a 48-hour hold. 
Out back. Any spot you can find. 
You sure about this? 
Yeah. The last place they'll check, their own impound yard. 
Trust me. 
You know, I've been thinking, when you blew up your car back there, you blew up mine, too. 
Yeah. So now you owe me a 10-second car. 
Is that right? 
Yeah. 
Now we're even. 
Is this your way of keeping me away from him? 
You're the only one I could call. 
He's my brother, of course. 
The bullet's not in there. 
I'm gonna clean it and stitch it up. 
It's going to hurt. I bet you're going to enjoy this. 
A little. 
Want some of this? Yeah. It's spicy. 
Dom, what are you doing? 
You reached first, you have to say grace. 
Thank you, Lord, for blessing this table. 
With food, family and friendship. 
You asked me why I let Dom go. 
I think it's because at that moment, 
I respected him more than I did myself. 
One thing I learned from Dom is that nothing really matters unless you have a code. 
And what's your code, Brian? 
I'm working on it. 
Shit. Hey, Dom. When were you gonna tell me? 
Dom, what are you doing? When were you gonna tell me you were running Letty? Let me explain... 
Dom, stop! 
You don't understand. 
I don't understand? Stop! 
Dom, stop! Dom, stop it! Please stop! 
She did it for you, Dom! 
Letty came to me to clear your name in exchange for bringing down Braga. 
She just wanted you to come home! 
I'm sorry, Dom! 
You better have one hell of an explanation. 
You disobeyed a direct order. 
Where's the shipment? 
It's safe. 
Look, we could use the shipment to parade in front of the media, get a few hundred pounds of heroin off the street, but Braga's just gonna send another shipment next week and the week after that. 
Let's use the shipment to lure Braga out and lop the head off a multi-billion dollar cartel. 
And how do you suggest we do that? 
A hand-to-hand exchange with Braga. 
He'll never show. He can't afford not to. 
You got a plan? 
There's a price. 
We bag Braga, you let Toretto walk. 
Yes? It's Dom. 
I was just thinking about you. You know, when I gave you my number, I was hoping you'd call. 
But not under these circumstances. 
What circumstances? 
Me being alive? 
Don't take it personally. 
It's just business. 
I got some business of my own. 
Get Campos. 
It's them. 
Uh-huh. Was that how Braga inspires loyalty? 
Killing his drivers? 
One can always find more drivers. 
It's just good business. 
I want to trade. 
Braga doesn't negotiate. 
Fine. You explain to him how all of a sudden $ 60 million worth of product disappears. 
I know that can't be good for business. 
What do you want? 
Six million cash, delivered by Braga himself. 
I don't like being shot at. 
I ain't gonna put my neck out again unless he's got something to lose, too. 
He'll never go for it. 
Either I deal with Braga, or you do. 
When and where? 
Sir, players are onsite. Holding positions at the perimeter. 
All right. Listen up. Everybody stay frosty. 
We don't move a muscle until O'Conner gives the signal. When he gets the money, you know what to do. 
Well, the good news is, when we get this guy, you walk out of here a free man. 
Is that what they told you? 
Yeah, that's the deal. 
You still put milk and cookies out for Santa Claus? 
Yeah. 
Here. In case things go shitty. 
Just like old times? 
Yeah. 
You dropped something. 
That's what you wanted, right? 
He's harmless. 
Don't worry about him. 
And he's really sorry about Letty. 
Where's our stuff? 
You mean the stuff that used to be in here, right? 
Well, you'll see it when we see Braga. 
That was the deal. 
No worries. Braga keeps his word. 
$ 2 million. You get the rest when I get my property. 
Stasiak. 
We got a match. The fingerprint's Braga's 100 %. 
Just waiting on facial confirmation via fax. I got a question for you. You wearing pink when you were clawing your way out of el barrio? 
Order all agents to move in. 
We got confirmation. Primary suspect wearing gray suit. 
Let's move. 
Sir, O'Conner hasn't given us the signal yet. 
What part of that didn't you understand? 
We just got confirmation. Do it! 
fbi AGENT : Secure primary suspect in gray suit. Repeat! 
He ain't Braga. 
Oh, shit. 
fbi! 
Get down! 
Get out of here! 
Get out of here, Dom! 
Run him down. 
Campos is Braga! 
Come on. 
Approaching primary target. Primary suspect is secure. He was under your nose the whole time. 
Now Braga's escaped. Toretto's heading south, probably long across the border by now. 
Do you have any idea the kind of trouble you're in, O'Conner? 
I was doing my job. He ain't the first bad guy you helped escape the law's grasp. 
As of now, you're being taken off active duty, until this house can mount a formal inquiry. 
What about Braga? 
That's no longer your concern. 
We now know where Braga is, right? 
Customs tracked him via satellite to his home base in Tecali, Mexico. 
Mexico is out of our jurisdiction. 
The fact is the brass will be so busy holding press conferences over the seizure, we'll skate under the radar. 
I thought we signed on to do the right thing. 
Everyone's looking for you. 
I'm right here. 
It's nice to see you've gone with the times and switched to electronic fuel injection. Looks good. 
Buster became a gearhead. 
I'm going with you. 
I don't plan on bringing anyone back. 
I know. 
Hit that throttle. 
How do you say goodbye to your only brother? 
You don't. 
I thought you weren't gonna show up. 
You saved my life. 
I'm willing to return the favor. 
This will help get you to Braga. 
Dom. 
Going in there is suicide. 
I have no choice. 
You must have loved her very much. 
So this is where my jurisdiction ends. 
And this is where mine begins. 
You ain't forgiven. 
You boys want to arrest me? 
No, we're beyond that. 
You can't buy your way out of this one. 
You and me... 
You and me, we're not so different. 
You're no hero. 
You're right. 
And that's why you're going back across the border. 
But Fenix is mine. 
You got it. 
Shit! 
You'll make it a couple of miles out, if you're lucky. 
You know where you're going? 
You want to borrow my GPS? 
Where are your boys at? 
Are they going to show up or what? 
Careful what you ask for. 
Just stop. Just stop the car. 
Right behind you. 
Dom, head to the tunnel. Let's use the tunnel. 
Get out of here, Brian. 
You sure you know where the tunnels are? 
This might hurt. 
You're in my world now, baby! 
That's it, baby! 
End of the road. Now what? 
Game over. No, no, no. 
Come on! 
Get me out of here! 
Pussy. 
Let me see that. 
Yeah. Just keep pressure there. 
You gotta get out of here. 
I ain't running anymore. 
I gotta ask you something. 
Yeah? 
You know I would have won that race if you didn't cheat, right? 
You hit your head hard. 
Don't make me laugh. 
All rise. 
Please be seated. 
Please rise, Mr. Toretto. 
I've listened to the testimony and taken into special consideration 
Agent O'Conner's appeal of clemency on behalf of Mr. Toretto. 
That his actions directly resulted in the apprehension of known drug trafficker Arturo Braga. 
However, this judiciary finds that one right does not make up for a lifetime worth of wrongs. 
And as such, I find that I am forced to level the maximum sentence under California law. 
Dominic Toretto, you are hereby sentenced to serve 25 years to life at the Lompoc maximum security prison system without the possibility of early parole. 
This court is adjourned. 
So even if Columbus got lost and wasn't the first to discover America, he's still my hero. 
He was really brave to sail such a tiny ship over a really big ocean, and because of him, we get Columbus Day off of school. 
Thank you, Heather. 
Ronnie, tell us about your hero. 
What's he writing? 
Hachiko was my grandfather Wilson's dog. 
Everyone called Hachi a mystery dog because they never really knew where he came from. 
Maybe Hachi escaped from a dog pound. 
Or maybe he jumped out of somebody's car from someplace far away like Florida or New Jersey. 
But no matter how, Hachi was lost. 
Hey, it's a little puppy. 
But no matter how it happened, a long time ago, in the town my grandfather lived in, 
Hachi appeared at the train station, and that's where their story began. 
No, it was great. 
I loved the musicians. 
No, no, no, I'll walk. 
I'll walk. 
Yeah, I love you, too. 
Bye. 
Hey, buddy. Are you lost? 
Come here. 
You lost here, bud? 
Someone must be looking for you. 
Little guy was wandering around. Really? 
Out on the platform? 
On the platform, yeah. 
Well, good for you for finding him. Yeah. 
Well, I'll tell you what. 
This little crate was out there. 
It was broken. 
I don't know what's going on, but... 
- Anyhow, someone's gonna be here for him. 
- Yeah. 
So if you'll just hold him here. 
You just hold him till they come. 
No, I can't do that. 
I can't do that, Professor. 
Well, he was out... No one's gonna leave this dog. There's... 
No, I know that. 
I know no one's gonna leave it. 
They'll be back for it. 
So you take him with you, and when anyone shows up, I'll tell them that you have him. 
Someone's gonna be here. They're gonna come for him. 
No, you don't understand. Really, just, just... 
I'm gonna have to put this in here for like the whole night if nobody comes. 
If they're not here, I'll lock him in here and he'll be safe for the night, but all I can do is take him to the pound in the morning. 
Good thing it's Friday, you know? 
We'll find out where you're headed. 
Until then, you can stay with me in a nice warm house. 
How's that? 
Yeah? 
All right. 
Here you go. 
Sit right here. 
Sit right there. 
Okay, yeah. 
Here you go. 
Okay. 
Stay, stay. 
Chew on those. It's okay. 
Hello, handsome. 
Hi. 
Hi. 
How'd it go? 
It was great. 
Good. You miss me? 
Not a bit. You? 
No. 
Didn't think about you once. 
I have a little surprise. 
Yeah, well, I have a little surprise for you, too. 
Come on. We have some catching up to do. Yeah. 
Catching up. 
Okay, we'll catch up. 
Did you hear something? 
That was a branch against the window. 
I ran into this interesting situation at the station tonight. 
Why don't you tell me about it in the morning? 
How does that sound? 
What am I gonna do? 
Okay, okay. Okay, it's all right. 
Parker! 
We had an agreement. I know, I know. 
Or did you forget? 
No, I didn't forget. 
No, it was... 
He was at the train station. 
I mean, just kind of lost. 
Carl was gonna send him to the pound tomorrow and I thought... 
You just thought you'd bring him home and talk me into keeping him, right? 
No, no, I don't want to keep him. I don't. 
Tomorrow morning I'm getting up, and I'll find out exactly where he belongs, okay? 
I promise you, I will do that. 
All right. 
This was Luke's stuff. 
Okay, okay. 
Okay, here you go. 
There you go. 
Now look. Lots of good stuff here. 
That's warm. You got that. 
It's pretty cold. 
You like this? Yeah? 
This was Luke's favorite. 
Okay. 
Okay, here's your water. 
Some story you could tell, huh? 
Couldn't you? 
Yeah. 
Okay, buddy. 
That's better. 
Good night, buddy. 
You know, you're the one who should be in the doghouse. 
I promise I won't bite your toe. 
Puppy! 
Puppy! 
Hey, puppy! 
Puppy! Puppy, come on! 
That's good. 
Good puppy. 
Dad, I love him. 
Does he have a name yet? 
Yes, he does. 
" Temporary Guest." 
You have to keep him. 
Dad, the house feels so empty since Luke's been gone. 
Ask your mother. 
- Mom? 
- Yeah? 
Could you come here, please? 
Look, he even likes your music. 
Really! 
I can't believe it! 
This is a wonder dog! 
I absolutely have to keep this dog. 
No more dogs. 
Don't encourage him. 
I won't. 
You're so mean. 
Dad, he's gonna jump out of that. 
Here. 
Oh, yeah, that's great. 
Try this. 
I love it. Does he fit? 
I think so. 
You in there, bud? 
Yeah! 
No, that's good. 
I like it. 
Great. 
So, you saw Michael last night? Yeah. 
We drove over to the look-out, watched the comets. 
It was beautiful. 
Very romantic. 
It was. 
Definitely happened more often... 
Are you the... 
Can I help you, pal? Yeah, yeah. 
I just found this little guy at the station last night. 
Can you board him until we find his owner? 
Board him? 
No, we can't board him. 
This isn't a boarding service. It's a pound, pal. 
Look, I just found him. 
What am I gonna do with him? 
Let's see. 
Yeah. 
He's cute. 
That'll help with adoption, but we give them two weeks. 
Come on. 
Two weeks? 
Yeah. We're packed. 
Excuse me. 
I'll call you next week then. All right. Bye-bye. 
Morning, Mary Anne. 
How you doing, Parker? 
I'm doing great. 
I was wondering if I could ask you for a favor. 
Sure, anything. 
Look at this! 
Hey, little one! 
Hello. 
Hello! 
Oh, he's gorgeous! 
Where'd you come from? 
He was wandering around the station last night. 
Hi, sweetheart. 
I don't know, it's very strange. 
Really? 
He's adorable. 
I just want to put that up. Yeah? 
Okay, fine, fine. 
Window? Hello. Yeah, right over there. 
Any one of those. 
Parker, this dog is just fabulous. 
You wouldn't be interested, would you? 
What, the puppy? 
A fine young puppy like that. 
What do you think, Antonia? 
New roommate? 
Oh! No! Antonia! 
Yeah, yeah. 
Morning, Mr. Professor. 
Jasjeet. 
One sugar, two cream, coming up. 
Hey, what have you got there? 
I got a new friend here. 
You want a dog? 
I prefer cash. 
He'd be a great guard dog for you, wouldn't he? 
Guard dog to guard the hot dogs? 
I don't think so. 
I don't think so, either. 
Seriously, man, why you want a dog? 
Every day you have to walk him, feed him, clean him, pick up the poop. 
How many of these can I have for him? 
On the house. 
Too much trouble. Yeah, you're right. 
Thank you, Jas. 
My pleasure. 
Hey, any news? 
No. 
Nobody came, nobody showed up, nobody called. 
Nobody? 
Strange. 
Really strange. 
Can you hold him a second? Yeah. 
You're cute. 
I made up some flyers. 
Would you put that up for me? 
Come on. 
All right, I'll put them up for you. 
What a sweetheart you are. 
I know, I know, I know. 
Come on. 
He really likes being in the bag. 
Thanks. 
Professor, no dogs on the train. 
No dogs on the train. 
Thank you. 
Okay, hold on a second. 
Let me try something. 
We skip the repeat of the first section and go directly to the lyrical section. 
Okay. 
Let's try that. 
But just it means you've got to build up quicker. You don't have to... 
And when we get to the lyrical section, just big breaths, big breaths. 
Don't forget to breathe. 
Hello. 
That's great. 
You don't want a puppy, do you? 
You want a puppy? 
This was the only thing left on the crate. 
Mmm." Yamanashi." 
That's all I can read. 
What's that? 
It's a part of central Japan. 
No ordinary dog, Parker. No. 
It's an Akita, or Akita, as you'd say. 
It's a very special breed. Yeah? 
What is that? 
Hachi. What? 
It's Japanese for" Eight." 
Number of good fortune. Oh. 
Good fortune. 
Very nice. 
Hachi. 
Hachi. 
That's a good name. 
I like that. 
He might have been born eighth in the litter. 
Spiritual significance in number eight reaches up to heaven, comes down to Earth. 
So what do you think? 
Do you want him? 
Me? 
No, I think he's made his choice. 
Meaning what? 
Well, meaning he's your problem, not mine, brother. 
You're not a problem, are you? 
Well... 
Whether you found him or he found you, who's to say? 
It's meant to be. 
He was also saying that the shoguns bred these Akitas for combat and hunting. 
So I guess in a way, they're kind of dog royalty. 
Did Ken give you any ideas where you could find this royal dog a home? 
I put up 10 flyers already. 
You know, someone's going to claim Hachi. 
Who's Hachi? 
This... 
It's what was on his collar. That's the symbol. 
You named him? No, I didn't... 
Parker, you want to keep him. 
No, I do not. You do. 
You do. 
I don't want to keep him. Admit it. 
Admit it. 
You do. 
You want to keep him. I wasn't even thinking about it. Yes. 
Hachi? 
Where'd you go? 
Oh, no! Parker, that's months of hard work! 
Cate, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
I want him to stay out there all night, Parker. Yes, yes. 
He's not coming back in. 
Do you hear me? I hear you. 
End of discussion. 
I hear you. 
I heard you before, I hear you right now. 
Four months of work. 
Hachi. 
Come on, buddy. 
Come on, here. 
Yeah, you're coming inside. 
Let's go. 
Okay. 
See if I can find you here. 
Yeah, there you are. 
Your bloodline goes back at least 4, 000 years, maybe much more. 
Yeah. 
What else we got here? 
Yeah. 
You like that? 
It says the first partnership between man and animals was with you. 
Did you know about that? 
Did you know that already? 
You did, didn't you? 
Yeah, think you did. 
Shut this down. 
Let's see if we can settle you down now. 
Hey, this looks pretty good, huh? 
All right, stay there. 
Stay there now. Okay? 
All right, stay. 
Stay. Stay there. 
At some point he establishes inside so that the Braves hitters... 
Okay. 
... don't lean out there and start shooting the ball into right field, which is what they did in Game 2. 
I'll just stay for a little bit. 
Runner at second, two out. 
It stays fair, Lopez, very good play to end the inning. 
Excuse me. 
Don't... 
I was just coming up. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, sure. 
Just one night. 
One night only, okay? 
Be a good boy. 
Stay there. 
All right, you'll be fine. 
I can't believe it. 
He loves the Yankees. 
No, really? 
Really? 
He does. 
Oh, this is gonna be fun. 
All right, Hachi, this is what we're gonna do. 
This is a ball. 
Ball, throw. 
You go get it, you bring it back, okay? Okay? 
You ready? 
Go get it. 
Go get it. 
No, no, no, the ball. 
Hach. 
Hachi. 
Hachi, Hachi, Hachi. Hey, Hachi. 
Hachi. 
Now I'll throw it, you bring it back, okay? 
Here we go. 
Go get it. 
Hachi. 
No, no, no. Get the ball. 
Hachi, come here. 
Hachi, come on. 
Go get it. 
Come here, come here, come here. 
Hachi, Hachi. 
See the ball? See the ball? 
Come here. 
Hachi. 
Hachi, come here. 
Come here. 
You can do this, I know you can. 
I just think you're being a little tough about it. 
The clog's in a fix and Dad's just trying to do the right thing. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Mom. 
Hachi, Hachi. 
The ball. 
Ball, ball, ball. 
Get the ball. 
Come on now. 
He's lost it. 
Hachi. Hey, hey. 
Hello? 
The puppy flyers, yes. 
Are you the clog's owner? 
No, no one's come forward yet. 
We just want to make sure the dog has a good home. 
Could I get your number? 
I'm sure my husband would want to call you. 
Hold on a second, I need to find a pen. Hold on, okay? 
Hachi, Hachi, Hachi. 
Come here. 
Hachi. 
Good. 
Hachi. 
Hi, Hachi. 
Hachi. 
Hey, Dad, let me get a picture. 
Hello? 
Hey, boy. 
The clog's already been taken. 
Yes. 
I'm really sorry. 
Hachi. 
Whoa! No, no, no! 
Hach. 
Hach. 
Hach, Hach. 
Okay, come on. 
Come on, take it in. 
Take it in. 
No, you can't go. 
Can't go. 
I gotta go to work. 
See you back here tonight. 
Bye. 
Good morning, Mr. Professor. 
Good morning. 
You're a little late today. 
Already waiting. 
Thank you. 
One sugar, two cream. 
Last call for the 8 : 32 express to Providence. 
Excuse me, excuse me. 
Hachi! 
What are you doing here? 
What are you doing here? 
What are you doing? 
You gotta go home, okay? Go. 
No, go home. 
Go home, go on. 
I gotta get on the train. 
Go, go. 
Okay, come on. 
Gotta go home. Come on. 
Professor, you want me to hold it? Yeah, could you? 
Thirty seconds. 
Thanks. 
Go home, go home. 
Okay, go. 
Go on, go home. 
Hey, Chuck, we're holding it up for a moment, all right? 
Go home. Go home! 
Go, go, go! 
Go on home. 
Come on, Hachi, go on home. 
Go home, go on. 
He's really got him trained, doesn't he? 
Good boy! 
Professor? 
Okay. 
Thanks, Carl. You sure? 
Yeah, yeah. 
All right, let her go. Let her go. 
Want me to call you a cab? 
No, I'll walk him home. 
It's all right. 
Oh, man! 
Parker? 
I thought you left for work. 
I did. 
You're gardening now? 
He got out. I missed the train. 
Oh! Don't say it. No. 
Here. I know what you're gonna say. 
Now here, let me do this. 
You're gonna get filthy. 
I'll fill it in. Get the next train. 
Okay. 
Thanks. 
And you, you stay. 
He will. 
See you tonight. 
Here's a treat. 
Here's a treat. 
All right, okay. 
Okay, just one more. 
Just one more. That's it. 
Hold on, hold on. 
Okay? 
Is that good? 
Okay. 
All right, all right. 
This is the last one. 
There you go. 
Good boy, Hachi. 
All right. 
Okay. 
One last one. 
There you go. 
That's great. 
That is really great, everybody. 
I'm proud of you. 
Sorry I was late again. All right? 
I'm off the hook? 
Yeah. 
Good. Thank you. 
Hey, Hachi. 
What are you doing here? 
Hi. Hey, Hachi! 
Hey! How you doing? 
What are you doing here? 
Bedridge Station. 
Look at you! 
Yes. 
Yes, ma'am, we got one at 7 : 30. 
You okay? 
He been here all day? 
No, no, no. 
He just showed up two minutes ago. 
He went right there. 
You're kidding. 
Have you seen Cate? 
I haven't seen her. 
All right. 
Okay. I don't know, I guess we'll go home. 
All right. 
You son of a gun. 
Come on. 
Come on, boy. 
Come on. 
Come on. 
Mom? 
Yeah, sweetie, I'm in here. 
Hey, hi. 
Hi. 
I got the chips. Hi, honey. Oh, thanks. 
Hey, Mrs. Wilson, good to see you. Hi. 
Oh, Michael, nice to see you. 
Call me Cate. Okay. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. Everything looks delicious. 
Oh, good. Yeah, that's a great spread. 
Why don't you take this to Dad? 
Sure. He's out back. 
Let's get this started. The grill's ready? 
It's getting there, yeah. 
Nice to see you. 
Should I chop these? 
You, too. Yeah, that'd be great, hon. 
Let's see... 
You know, I actually took guitar lessons for a little bit, when I was a kid. 
Did you? 
Yeah, like when I was nine or 10 years old. 
I had to stop because my brother slammed my fingers in the car door. 
I mean, he always said it was an accident, but after that I just... 
I don't know, I stopped practicing. 
I wish I didn't, though, because I really... It's just, I love music, you know, and I have so much respect for musicians and people who play instruments... 
Michael, do you love my daughter? 
Yes, sir. 
Yes, I do. 
Well, that's good because that's what you want to remember on the bad days. 
Right. 
Hachi, this is Michael. 
Michael, Hachi. 
Pleased to meet you. 
Hachi. Hey, you wanna play a little catch? 
Yeah? 
Ready? 
Okay, go get the ball. Go get it! 
There it is! 
Get the ball. 
It's right there. 
Go! Hachi, go get it. Go! 
Go get the ball. 
Michael, you want to get that ball back, you're gonna have to get it yourself. 
Hachi doesn't fetch. 
He doesn't do it. 
Okay. 
Are you all right? Are you okay? 
Totally good. Totally good. 
Keep playing. Honey, are you okay? 
Are you okay? 
Totally. Are you sure? 
I'm gonna get the ball. 
Okay. 
I'm good. 
Look at that. 
Are you really okay? 
Don't let me disrupt the game. Okay. Okay. 
Are you all right? Are you okay? 
He was just distracting you there. 
Okay. 
If I throw the ball just one foot, you go get it, okay? 
Even if I just toss it right here, he's not gonna get it? Really? 
You're not? 
- Fetch? 
- Fetch, right. 
I throw, he brings back. 
He won't do it. 
Not Akitas, Parker. 
What, they have something against fetching? 
No. 
You want a dog that fetches, you get a collie, you get a springer spaniel. 
No, Hachi's fine with me. 
I'm okay. 
Well, good, because Akitas are not into people-pleasing. 
What are they into? 
He comes to the train because he has a special connection with you. 
" Here, buddy. 
Go get that ball." Why would he do that? 
For fun? 
For a cookie? 
Because it'd make me happy, basically. 
They can't be bought. 
They're Japanese, not American. 
Give me a break, man. 
Well, if he's gonna fetch, it'll be for a very special reason. 
I'll find a reason. 
No, no, no. 
No, Hach, come on. 
You can't go. 
I'm sorry, but you can't go. Come on. 
Come on. 
No, stay. 
Okay, come on. 
Come on. 
It's all right, come on. 
Come on, come on. 
Hey, Hach! 
Hach! Hach! 
Hach! 
Come on, come on. 
Hey, Hach. 
Hach! 
Let's go. Come on. 
Come on! 
Come on! 
Good morning, Milton. Morning. How are you? 
How you doing today? 
Myra. 
Morning, Parker. 
Stay out of the sun. 
Good morning, Mr. Professor. 
Hey, good morning. 
Good morning, Parker. He won't bite, huh? 
Thank you. 
No, no, he's doing really good. 
Come on, boy. 
All right, I want you to go straight home now. 
Go straight home. 
You'll do that for me? 
I'll see you here tonight. 
Go ahead. 
Go on home. 
Good boy. 
Good boy! 
Great day, Carl, isn't it? 
Have a good one, Professor. 
Hachi. 
There, yes. 
Don't tell Milton. 
Yeah. 
Hey, Hachi. 
Good dog! 
What a good boy. 
Okay, come on. Let's go home. 
Come on. 
Come on. 
That's good. 
Hey, Hach. 
Come on, come on. 
Let's go. 
Let's go! 
Some more champagne? 
Is there anymore champagne? 
On three. 
One, two, three. 
Hachi! 
That's great, Jake. 
Thanks. 
Cate. 
You seen Hachi? He wasn't at the station. 
No, I haven't seen him since this morning. 
Look at her. 
Can you believe they had her covered for 30 years? 
Isn't she beautiful? 
Yeah, she is. 
I'm falling behind schedule. 
Oh, you'll catch up. 
Just think about opening night. That'll freak you out. 
The young soloist steps downstage, sings from La Boheme and then dance, of course. 
Following that, rock, rap, hip-hop, jazz and Hamlet. 
And then, of course, the entire town is going to rise up, standing ovation. 
The place is going crazy. 
Mayor sees you down there, he pulls you up onstage, puts you center stage and thanks you for making it all possible. 
Yeah? Yeah. 
I like it. 
Hachi! 
Come on, boy. 
Hachi! 
Hachi. 
What are you doing here? 
It's all right. 
Stay, stay. 
Hachi, stay. 
Okay, go, go away. 
Go on, get out. 
Get! 
Get! 
Get out of here. 
Get out! 
Get out! 
Hachi. 
Come on, come on, come on! 
Parker? 
We got skunked. 
You want to come in with us? 
No, I'm gonna pass. 
Okay. 
You better open a window before you go to sleep. 
You really think we smell that bad? 
You're probably right. 
Mom! 
Hi, honey. 
What's up? 
I have to tell you something. 
Guess what? 
What? 
Okay, wait. 
What? Just wait. 
Wait. 
What? 
See anything different? 
No. 
Yes! 
Oh, sweetheart! 
That's so wonderful! 
Oh, I have to call Grandma right away. Okay. 
Where's Dad? 
Out there, as usual. 
Daddy. 
Dad. 
Dad, what are you doing? 
It's a full-body massage. 
I'm following the book. 
See... You're gonna be a grandpa. 
You gotta get really deep down in there, in the muscle. 
Dad. Dad. 
Michael and I are having a baby. 
I'm pregnant. 
Jeez! 
You're... 
Really? 
Yes. 
You're having a baby? 
I'm gonna be a grandpa. 
Yes. 
Catie! 
I can't believe this! 
This is terrific, honey. 
I'm so happy for you. 
Hi, sweetie. 
Hey, Mom. 
I'm sorry I'm late. 
What you got? 
I've got all kinds of healthy things for you. 
Fresh-cut vegetables, raspberries, pita with hummus and sprouts. 
You know, when I was carrying you, I was sending out your father for pizza with red peppers and double anchovies for weeks straight. 
He couldn't even watch me eat it. 
Can you believe you and Dad have been together for 25 years? 
We've been together longer than we've been apart. Wow. 
Dad said after your first date, by the time he got back to the car, he missed you so much he went back for you. 
I know. 
I was watching from the window. 
When I saw him come up the walk again, 
I almost ran out the door and jumped into his arms. 
You should have. 
I know. 
But I always stop and think too much. 
That's true. 
You do. 
Don't do that. 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Hey, Hach. 
Come on, Hachi, come on. Come on, come on. 
Yeah! 
Come on, let's go home. 
Let's go home. 
Hey, Mr. Professor. 
Good night, Parker. 
Good night, Mary Anne. How'd you train that dog to do that? 
That's amazing. 
Let's go. 
Parker? 
Parker? 
Parker? 
You're overdressed. 
Well, there's something I might be able to do about that. 
Thank you. 
Anything else you require, madam? 
That depends on what you've got. 
Everything. 
Everything? 
Yeah, everything. 
Okay. 
You've had to put up with a lot. I know that. 
I don't know if I've ever thanked you. 
You know how much I love you? 
And I love you. 
Good. Yeah. 
Especially when you don't smell like a dog or a skunk. 
Which isn't very often, actually, so I should worry about... 
Well, it happens more often... 
I love you. 
Love you, too. I'll call you later. 
Bye-bye. 
Okay, Hachi, come on. 
Hachi, come on. 
Come on now. 
What's wrong with you? 
Come on. 
What is it? 
Come here, come here. 
Come on. 
Come here. 
What is with you? 
Come here now. 
You got a problem? 
Come here. 
You're all right. 
What's going on, huh? 
You're all right. 
Okay. 
You all right, now? 
Okay, come on. 
Come on. 
What's wrong with him? 
I don't know. 
Hachi, you want to come? Because I gotta go. It's a work day. 
Come on, buddy. 
Come on. 
I gotta go. 
Love you, honey. 
Love you, too. 
See you tonight. 
Last chance. 
Bye. 
Hey, Mary Anne. 
Hey, Jas, how are you? 
I'm good. 
Here's your coffee and donut. 
Oh, thank you, Jasjeet. Thank you. 
Where's Hachi? 
Hey, Hachi! 
There he comes. 
Am I happy to see you. 
What? Did you bring me your ball? 
What is he doing with a ball? 
You want to play catch? 
Here. 
Here. 
Come here, come here. 
Here you go. 
Go get it. 
Okay, go get it. 
Go get it. 
All right, good. 
Now bring it back. 
Oh, that's it. 
That's what I wanted. 
Let's try another one. Big one. Big long one. 
Okay, go get it. 
Go on. 
Good boy! 
Yeah! 
Now bring it back. 
Okay, come on. 
Come on, boy, come on, come on! 
What a good boy! 
What a good boy! 
Aren't you the good boy! 
Did you see that? 
I threw the ball, he brought it back. 
First time, a fetch. A real fetch. 
Yeah. Congratulations. 
Thank you. 
You are a good boy! 
Okay, gotta go to work. 
Come on, take your ball. 
There you go. 
First time. 
First time! 
No, no. 
Wait, wait, wait, Mr. Professor! Wait, wait. 
I'll bring you your coffee right now. All right. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm late today. Did you see what he did? 
I threw the ball, he brought it back. 
It was a fetch. No, no, you keep the ball. 
You want me to have that? 
I can't play now, I gotta go to work. 
I gotta go to work. 
I'll keep the ball, all right? 
Okay. 
Here you go. Okay, thank you. 
You're welcome. - And I'll see you at 5 : 00. - I'll be here. 
Okay. 
Go home, Hachi. 
Go home. 
All right, come here. 
Come here, come here. 
Come here. 
Come on. 
Okay. It's all right. 
I'll see you at 5 : 00, all right? 
Good boy. 
Stay, go home. 
Go on. 
Go on. 
Was it any better that time? 
You remember we were talking about John Philip Sousa, great march composer around the turn of the century? 
He was a very famous man, but he had a huge thing about recorded music. 
He would never allow his music to be recorded. 
Even when Thomas Edison came to him with his brand-new invention, the phonograph. 
But Edison didn't care. He went ahead and did it anyhow. 
Secretly he recorded his marching band in a parade. 
Which I guess makes it the very first bootleg. 
So what do you think about that? 
Do you think Sousa was right? 
Do you think it's okay now? 
What about today's performers? 
Should you be able to just walk up in the middle of a stage, plug in your CD player to a Marshall stack and that's it? 
It's good enough? I don't know. 
I'm a lot older than you, but I tend to think that there's an element of music that cannot be captured. 
Life cannot be captured. 
The human heart cannot be captured. 
The moment of creation itself is fleeting. 
Hey, Hachi, how you doing? 
Hey, Hachi. 
Good night, Hachi. 
Hey, buddy. 
You ready to go home? 
Yeah? 
It's all right. 
It's all right. 
Hey, Hachi. 
Hey, boy. 
Is this how he did it? 
I'm sorry. 
I'll learn. 
Andy? 
It's time to go, sweetheart. 
You're a good boy. 
You stay here, okay? 
I'll be back. 
" I hear and behold God in every object 
" Yet understand God not in the least 
" Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself 
" In the faces of men and women I see God 
" And in my own face in the glass 
" I find letters from God dropt in the street 
" And every one is sign'd by God's name 
" And I leave them where they are 
" For I know that wherever I go 
" Others will punctually come forever and ever" 
Look, you don't have to wait anymore. 
He's not coming back. 
All right, Hachi. 
You do what you have to do. 
Come on, buddy, come on. 
Let's go. 
Come on, boy. 
Come on. 
Come on, Hachi. 
Come on, Hachi. 
You're gonna be with us now. 
Let's go. Come on. 
All right, we gotta go. Ronnie's waiting. 
Come on. 
Let me get that for you, sweetie. 
Come on, Hach. 
Up, up, up. 
There we go. 
That's a good boy. 
Good. 
Good boy, Hachi. 
Watch your head, watch your head. 
Good boy. 
Hey, there's my guy. Andy? 
Yeah? 
Hachi! 
Hachi! 
Andy! 
Hachi! 
Hachi, get back here! 
Hachi! 
Hachi, come on! 
Hachi! 
Hachi! 
Hachi! 
Hey, looks like you got your first visitor. 
Hey there, buddy. 
Come to welcome us to our new home? 
Hey, Hach. 
Hey, Hachi! 
What are you doing here? 
Lookie, lookie. 
He's going right to his spot. 
I thought he moved away. 
He did. 
He looks hungry, yeah? 
You are a softie, Jas. 
Hey, Hachi. 
Want a hot dog, boy? 
Go on, boy, have a hot dog. 
Hey, Hachi. 
Maybe it's your cooking, Jas. The Jasjeet special. 
Come on, you'll like it. 
Eat it. Eat it. It's good for you. 
Come on. 
It's good. 
Where did he come from? 
Just showed up. 
Come on, boy. 
Take it. 
You better be careful, Hachi. 
He's got hot dogs in there older than you. 
Don't listen to them, huh? 
- Hachi! 
- Oh, God. 
Hi! 
Oh, God, I was so worried about you. 
Why is she just hanging around him? 
It's the professor's daughter. 
Really? 
That's where he's been living. 
Will you come home with me? 
Hey, hey, hey... 
It's all right. 
It's okay. 
Come on. 
Come on. Let's go, buddy. 
Thank you very much. 
Okay. 
Thank you! 
That's the best thing. 
Come on, give me a coffee. 
Jasjeet, come on. 
Give me a coffee. 
I think of him, too. 
Every day. 
You know we love you, Hachi. 
We want you to stay here with us. 
But if you have to go, that's okay, too. 
Okay. 
Goodbye, Hachi. 
Good afternoon, Hachi. 
Hey, Hachi. 
Here you go. 
Don't tell Myra, all right? 
Good night, Hachi. 
Hello, how are you? 
I think... 
Lucky! Let's go. 
Come on, sweetie. 
Hey, Lucky. 
Hey, girl. 
Come on, Lucky, let's go. 
Hey, excuse me, sir. 
Mmm-hmm. 
The dog out there. 
Yeah? 
Is that the dog that I've been hearing so much about? 
Mmm-hmm. 
What's it to you? 
I'm sorry. 
I'm Teddy Barnes. I'm with the Woonsocket Call. 
Yeah, I've been hearing a lot of talk about him on the trains. 
I don't know, sounds like it could make a good story. 
It's Boilins, Carl Boilins. 
B - O - I 
- L 
- I - N 
- S. Yes. 
There's no" Y" in there. 
I'm the one that found him, handed him over. 
Oh, yeah? 
So, Carl, where's he live? 
Well, we're not really sure. 
He comes and goes. 
Nobody bothers him? 
No, we put up with him. 
He just does what he's doing. 
Hey, you mind if I take a picture? 
For the newspaper. 
I don't mind if Hachi don't mind. 
Thank you very much. 
Very nice, very nice. 
One without first, please. 
Without the dog? 
All right. 
Stay there. 
Well, I... 
Oh, yeah. 
All right. I appreciate it. 
That's very kind of you. 
Okay, nice and tight. Oh, yeah. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Look at that there. 
Big smile. 
That's... 
That's beautiful. 
Thank you. 
Hey, Hachi. 
This kid in Derry sent you his lunch money. 
He wants me to buy you treats with it. 
It's like the third one this week. 
If this keeps up, I'll have to open a bank account for you. 
Don't say I never gave you nothing. 
The clog's making out like a bandit here. 
Look at this, isn't that cute? 
Hey, Hach. 
What are you doing with the money? 
I'm his executor. 
Be right with you, sir. 
River Junction local is now boarding on track two, it's making all stops. 
Hachi. 
Here you go, Hachi. 
There you are. 
Hungry, huh? 
Yes, he's very cold. 
I'm Jasjeet. 
I run the hot dog stand. 
I'm Ken Fujiyoshi, Professor Wilson's friend. 
Mr. Professor? 
One sugar, two cream. 
So then you must have read the article, then? 
I did. 
You saw my name in the article? Yes, I did. 
Twice. 
Please, let me help with the expense. 
No, no, no, please. 
No money. What if he gets sick? 
Medical expenses? 
We'll take a collection. 
From the travelers, the vendors, and we will take care of it for him. 
The station square is Hachi's home now. 
Every day he comes, same time, same place, here only. 
You'll do that for him? 
Take care of him? Of course. 
All right, then I... 
I've got to sell some hot dogs. Good to meet you. 
You, too. Thank you very much. 
It's been a year, hasn't it? 
I wake up sometimes in the middle of the night and think about Parker. 
He was a good friend. 
I understand how you feel. 
Hachi, my friend, Parker is never coming home. 
But if Hachiko wants to wait, then Hachiko should wait. 
You want to wait for him, don't you? 
Have a long life Hachi. 
Come on, mister. 
There we are. 
That's a good boy. 
Want some more? 
Okay, come on. 
Okay, come on, boy. 
Last piece. 
It's good, huh? 
See you tomorrow, Hachi. 
Ciao, Hachi. 
Final call for Oakland, 
Wood River Junction and Four Corners leaving from track two. 
Ms. Wilson? Nice to see you again. 
Good afternoon. 
Thank you. 
That's the professor's wife, huh? 
Cate. 
Ken. 
It's been a while. 
It certainly has. 
It's 10 years. 
Can you believe it? 
Hi, Hachi. 
Hi, Hachi. 
All right, have a good one. 
Thank you, Jas. 
- Who would've thought? 
- I know. 
I mean, when we first went in there, I was like... 
Hachi? 
Hachi? 
You old thing, you're still waiting. 
That's right. 
If it's all right, could I wait with you for the next train? 
Yeah? 
Thanks. 
Oh, Hachi. 
- That's so cute. 
- You like that one? Yeah. 
Yeah. That's good, isn't it? 
That's me. 
I know, I remember. 
I remember. 
I was there that day. I took that picture. 
He still looks so cute. 
He went to the wedding. 
Yeah. 
He's right there. 
Right there. 
Where did Grandpa find Hachi? 
Ronnie, actually, Hachi found your grandfather. 
How? 
One night your grandfather was coming back from a trip. 
He got off at the train station, he went inside of the train station... 
Hey, boy. 
Hey! 
Come on, let's go. 
Come on! 
Hachi! 
Hey, boy. 
I never met my grandfather. 
He died when I was just a baby. 
But when I hear about him and Hachi, I feel like I know him. 
They taught me the meaning of loyalty, that you should never forget anyone that you've loved. 
And that's why Hachi will forever be my hero. 
Oh, my God, look how cute he is! 
Hi, boy. He drives me crazy. 
Oh, he's happy to see somebody. 
I know. 
Can you walk? 
Come on, Hachi. 
Let's go. 
Come on. 
Hey, here boy. 
Movie Fan News presents : 
Spotlight on" Adventure". 
What you are now witnessing is footage never before seen by civilized humanity, a lost world in South America, lurking in the shadow of Majestic Paradise Falls it's full of plants and animals undiscovered by science. 
Who would dare set foot on this inhospitable summit? 
Why, our subject today, Charles Muntz. 
The beloved explorer lands his dirigible," The Spirit of Adventure", into Hampshire, completing a year long expedition to the lost world. 
This mighty aircraft was designed by Charles Muntz himself and is longer than 22 throw edition petty wagons placed end to end. 
And here comes the adventurer now. 
Never-apart from his faithful dogs, 
Muntz conceived the craft for the canine comfort. 
It's a veritable flouting palace in the sky complete with doggy baths and mechanical canine walker. 
And Jiminy Cricket! 
To the locals he's considered a business and hero! 
And how! 
Adventure is out there! 
But what has Muntz brought back this time? 
Gentlemen, I give you the Monster of Paradise Falls! 
And gully, what a swell monster this is! 
But what's this? 
Scientists cry" Foul!" 
The National Explorers Society accuses Muntz of fabricating the skeleton. 
No! 
The organization strips Muntz of his membership. 
Humiliated, Muntz vows to return to Paradise Falls and promises to capture the beast... alive. 
I promise to capture the beast alive! 
And I will not come back until I do! 
And so, the explorer's off to clear his name. 
Bon voyage, Charles Muntz! 
And good luck capturing the Monster of Paradise Falls!

Who knows what lives up there! 
And once I get there... 
I'm gonna save all these pages for all the adventures I'm gonna have. 
Only... 
I just don't know how I'm gonna get to Paradise Falls.

Hey, good morning, Mr. Fredricksen. 
Need any help there? No... 
Yes... 
Tell your boss over there that you boys are ruining our house. 
Well, just to let you know, my boss will be happy to take this whole place off your hand and would double his last offer. 
What do you say to that? 
I'll take that as a no, then. 
I believe I made my position to your boss quite clear. 
You poured prune juice in his gas tank. 
Yeah, that was good! 
Here, let me talk to him. 
You, in the suit. 
Yes, you! 
Take a bath, hippie! 
I am not with him! 
This is serious! 
He's out to get your house! 
Tell your boss he can have our house.

Good afternoon. 
My name is Russell and I am a wilderness explorer in tribe 54, squad lodge 12. 
Are you in need of any assistance today, Sir? 
No. 
I could... help you cross the street. 
No. 
I could help you cross your... yard? 
No. 
I could help you cross your... porch. 
No. 
Well, I gotta help you cross something. 
No, I'm doing fine. 
Good afternoon. 
- My name is Russell. 
- Kid... And I am a wilderness explorer in tribe 54. 
Slow down... 
-... squad lodge 12. 
- Kid! - Are you in need of any assistance? 
- Thank you, but I don't need any help! 
Aouch. 
Proceed. 
Good afternoon. 
Skip to the end! 
See these? 
These are my wilderness explorer badges. 
You may notice one is missing. 
It's my" Assisting the elderly badge". 
If I get it, I'll become a senior wilderness explorer! 
The wilderness must be explored! 
It's gonna be great! 
There is a big ceremony and all the dads come and... we pin on our badges... 
- So you wanna assist an old person. 
- Yeah! 
Then I'll be a senior wilderness explorer! 
- Have you ever heard of a" snipe"? 
-" Snipe"? 
A bird. Big eyes. 
Every night it sneaks into my yard and gobbles my poor azaleas. 
I'm elderly and infirm. 
I can't catch it. 
- If only someone could help me... 
- Me, me, I'll do it! 
I don't know, it's awfully crafty. 
You'd have to clap your hands three times to lure it in. 
I'll find her, Mr. Fredricksen! 
I think its burrow is two blocks down... 
Two blocks down. 
Snipe! 
Here, snipie, snipie... 
Bring it back here when you find it! 
Snipe! 
... and stop... 
Stop... 
Stop! 
Hey! 
Hey, you! 
What do you think you're doing? 
I am so sorry, Sir. 
Don't touch that! 
No, no, no, let me take care of that for you. 
Get away from our mailbox! 
- Sir... 
- I don't want you to touch that! 
It looks bad. 
Sorry, Mr. Fredricksen. 
You don't seem like a public menace to me. 
Take this. 
The guys from" Shady Oaks" will be by to pick you up in the morning, ok? 
What do I do now, Ellie? 
Good morning, gentlemen. 
Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen. 
You're ready to go? 
Ready as I'll ever be. 
Would you do me the favour and take this? 
I'll meet you in the van in just a minute. 
I... wanna say one last goodbye to the old place. 
Sure. 
Take all the time you need, Sir. 
That's typical. 
He's probably going to the bathroom for the 80th time. 
You'd think he'd take better care of his house. 
So long, boys! 
I'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls! 
SOUTH AMERICA 
We are on our way, Ellie. 
Hi, Mr. Fredricksen. 
It's me, Russell. 
What are you doing out here, kid? 
I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch. 
But this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse. 
Please, let me in. 
No. 
Aw, all right. 
You can come... in. 
I've never been in a floating house before. 
Goggles... 
Look at this stuff! 
Are you going on a trip? 
" Paradise Falls, a land lost in time". 
Are you going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen? 
Don't touch that! 
You'll soil it. 
You know, most people take a plane. 
But you're smart, because you have your TV, clocks and stuff. 
Ooo, is this how you steer your house? 
Does it really work? 
This makes it turn right and that way is left. 
Hey, look! 
Buildings! 
That building's so close, I can almost touch it! 
Wow, this is great! 
You should try this, Mr. Fredricksen. 
Look, there's a bus that could take me home two blocks away! 
Hey, I can see your house from here! 
Don't jerk around so much, kid! 
Well, that's not gonna work. 
I know that cloud, it's a" cumulonimbus". 
Did you know that a cumulonimbus... 
Aaa, I stayed up all night blowing up balloons... for what? 
That's nice, kid. 
What are you doing over there? 
Look! 
See? 
Cumulonimbus. 
My bag! 
Got you! 
Uuu, I thought you were dead. 
What happened? 
I steered us. 
I did it! 
I steered the house. 
You steered us? 
After you tied your stuff down, you took a nap. 
So I went ahead and steered us down here. 
Yeah, sure. 
I can't tell where we are. 
O, we're in South America all right. 
It was a singe. 
I used my wilderness explorer GPS. 
GP... what? 
My dad gave it to me. 
It shows exactly where we are on the planet. 
With this baby we'll never be lost! 
We'll get you down, find a bus stop, and you'll just tell the man you want to get back to your mother. 
Sure, but I don't think they have buses in Paradise Falls. 
There, that ought to do it. 
There, I'll give you some change for the bus fare. No, I'll just use my city bus pass. 
It's just gonna be like a billion transfers to get back to my house... 
Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer? 
Well, we're up pretty high. 
It'll take hours to get down. 
I think that was a building or something. 
What was that, Mr. Fredricksen? 
We can't be close to the ground yet. 
Wait, no, no! 
Wait, wait! 
Hang on! 
Pull back! 
Where... where are we? 
This doesn't look like the city or the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen. 
Don't worry, Ellie. 
I've got it. 
There it is! 
Ellie, it's so beautiful! 
We made it! 
We made it! 
Russell, we can float right over there. 
Climb up, climb up! 
Do you mean... assist you? 
- Yeah, whatever. 
- Ok, I'll climb up! 
- Watch it! 
- Sorry. 
Now... when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up. 
Got it? 
Are you on the porch yet? 
What? 
That's it? 
I came all this way here to get stuck on the wrong end of this rock pile? 
Ah... great. 
Hey, if I could assist you over there... would you sign up for my badge? 
What are you talking about? 
We could walk your house to the fall. 
- Walk it? 
- Yeah. 
After all we weigh it down, we could walk it right over there. 
Like a parade balloon. 
Now, we'll walk to the falls quickly and quietly, with no rap music or flash dancing. 
We have three days at best till the helium leaks out of those balloons. 
And if we are not at the falls when that happens... we're not getting to the falls. 
There... 
I found sand! 
Don't you worry, Ellie. 
We'll get our house over there. 
It is fun already, isn't it? 
By the time we get there, 
You're gonna feel so assisted... 
Oh, Mr. Fredricksen, if we happen to get separated, use the wilderness explorer call. 
Wait, why are we going to Paradise Falls, again? 
Hey, let's play a game. 
It's called :" See who can be quiet the longest". 
Cool! 
My mom loves that game! 
Darn thing... 
Come on, Russell, hurry it up. 
Ah, I'm tired. 
My knee hurts. 
Which knee? 
My elbow hurts and I have to go to the bathroom. 
I asked you about that five minutes ago. 
I didn't have to go then! 
I don't wanna walk anymore... 
Please, stop... 
Russell, if you don't hurry up, the tigers will eat you. 
There are no tigers in South America. 
Zoology. 
Ah, for the love of Pete... 
Go on into the bushes and do your business. 
Ok. 
Here! 
Hold my stuff! 
I've always wanted to try this. 
Mr. Fredricksen, am I suppose to dig the hole before or after? 
That's none of my concern. 
Oh, it's" before"! 
Tracks? 
Snipe. 
Here, snipe. 
Come on out, snipe. 
Snipe! 
Got you. 
Don't be afraid, little snipe. 
I am a wilderness explorer, so I'm a friend to all of nature. 
Want some more? 
Hi, boy. 
Don't eat it all. 
Come on out. 
Come on. 
Come on... 
Don't be afraid, little snipe. 
Nice snipe. 
Good little snipe. 
Nice... giant snipe! 
I found the snipe. 
Oh, did you? - Are they tall? 
- Oh, yes. 
They're very tall. 
Do they have a lot of colors? 
They do, indeed. 
- Do they like chocolate? 
- Oh, yeah... 
Chocolate? 
What is that thing? 
It's a snipe. 
There no such thing as a snipe! But you said... 
Go on, get out of here! 
Go! 
Careful, Russell. 
Look, Mr. Fredricksen, he likes me. 
- Russell! 
- No, stop! 
That tickles! 
Get out of here! 
Go on! 
Get! 
No, no, no. 
Kevin, it's ok. 
Mr. Fredricksen is nice. - Kevin? 
- Yes, that's the name I just gave him. 
Bit it, boo, scram! 
Hey, that's mine! 
Aah... Shoo, shoo! 
Get out of here! 
Go on, bit it! 
Can we keep him? Please? 
I'll get the food for him, I'll walk him, I'll change his newspapers... 
No. 
An explorer is a friend to all, be it a plant, a fish or a tiny mole. 
That doesn't even rhyme. Yeah, it does. 
- Hey, look, Kevin. 
- What? 
Hey, get down from there! 
You're not allowed up there! 
You come down here right now! 
Can you believe this, Ellie? 
Ellie? 
Hey, Ellie, can I keep the bird? 
Aha... aha 
She said for you to let me. 
But I told him no. 
I told you no. 
N 
- O! 
I see you, back there. 
Go on, get out of here! 
Shoo! Go annoy someone else for a while. 
Hey, are you ok over there? 
Hello? 
Oh, hello, Sir. 
Thank Goodness. 
It's nice to know someone else is up here. 
I can smell you. 
What? 
You can... smell us? 
I can smell you. 
- Hey! - You were talking to a rock. 
Hey, that one looks like a turtle. 
Look at that one! 
That one looks like a dog! 
- Ah, it is a dog. 
- What? 
We're not allowed to have dogs in my apartment. 
Hey, I like dogs! 
We have your dog! - I wonder whom he belongs to. 
- Sit, boy. 
Hey, look, he's trained! 
Shake. 
Aha. 
Speak. 
Hi, there. 
Did that dog just say" Hi, there"? 
Oh, yes! 
My name is Dug. 
I just met you and I love you. 
My master made me this collar. 
He is a good and smart master and he made me this collar so that I may talk. 
Squirrel! 
My master is good and smart. 
It's not possible. Oh yes... 
It is... because my master is smart. 
Hey, cool! 
What do these do, boy? 
Would you cut... I'd use that collar... 
I would be happy if you stopped. 
Russell, don't touch that. It could be... 
radioactive or something. 
I am a great tracker. 
My master sent me on a special mission. 
All by myself. 
Have you seen a bird? 
I want to find one and I've been on a scent. 
I'm a great tracker. 
Did I mention that? 
Hey, that is a bird. 
I have never seen one up close. But this is the bird. 
May I take your bird up to camp as my prisoner? 
Yes, yes, take it. 
And on the way, learn how to bark like a real dog. 
I can bark... And here's howling. 
Can we keep him, please? 
Please, please, please? 
- No. 
- But it's a talking dog! 
It's just a weird trick or something. 
Let's get to the fall. 
Please, be my prisoner! 
Oh, please oh, please, be my prisoner! 
I picked up the bird's scent! 
Wait a minute, wait a minute. 
What is this? 
Chocolate. 
I smell chocolate. 
I'm getting prunes and ginger cream. 
Who are they? 
Oh, man, the master will not be pleased. 
We'd better tell him someone took the bird, right, Alfa? 
No. 
Soon enough the bird will be ours again. 
Find the scent, my compadres, and you too, shall have much rewarding from the master for the toil that you did. 
Hey, Alfa, I think there's something wrong with your collar. 
You must have broken it. Yeah. Your voice sounds funny. 
Beta, Delta! 
Perhaps you desire... Squirrel! 
Perhaps you desire to challenge the right that I have been assigned by my strength and cunning. 
No, no. No. 
But maybe Dug would. 
You might wanna ask him. 
I wonder if he's found the bird on his" very special mission". 
Do not mention Dug to me at this time. 
His fool's errand will keep him most occupied, most occupied, indeed. 
But the second the master finds out that you sent Dug out by himself, none of us will get a treat. Do you not agree with that which I'm saying to you now? 
Sure. 
You're unwise, my trusted lieutenant. 
This is Alfa. 
Calling Dug. 
Come in, Dug. Hi, Alfa. 
Your voice sounds funny. 
I know, I know! 
Have you seen the bird? Oh, yes. 
The bird is my prisoner now. 
Yeah, right. 
Impossible. 
Where are you? 
I am here with the bird and I will bring it back, and then you like me. 
Oh, gotta go. Dug, who are you talking to? 
- Wait, wait! 
- What is Dug doing? 
Why is he with the small mailman? 
Where are they? 
There he is. Come on! 
Please, oh, please, be my prisoner. 
Dug, stop bothering Kevin! That man over there says I can take the bird. 
And I love that man there like he is my master. 
I am not your master! I am warning you once again, bird! 
- Hey, quit it! 
- I am jumping on you now, bird! 
At this rate we will never get to the falls! 
I am nobody's master, got it? 
I don't want you here and I don't want you here! 
I'm stuck with you! 
If you two don't clear out of here by the time I count to three... 
A ball! 
Oh, boy, oh, boy, a ball! 
Ball? 
You want a ball? 
Yes, I do! 
I ever so want the ball! 
Go get it! 
Oh, boy, I will get it and then bring it back! 
Quick, Russell, give me some chocolate. 
- Why? 
- Just give to me! 
Bird! 
Bird! 
Come on, Russell. 
Wait! 
Wait, Mr. Fredricksen! 
What are you doing? 
Hey, we're pretty far now. 
Kevin's gonna miss. 
I think that did the trick. 
Hi, master. 
Afternoon. 
Well, thanks for keeping us dry, anyway, Ellie. 
Which one is the front? 
Well, boy... 
Is this step three or step five? 
There. 
All done. 
That's for you. 
Well, tents are hard. 
Wait, aren't you super wilderness guy with the GPS and the badges? 
Yeah, but... 
Can I tell you a secret? 
- No. 
- All right. 
Here it goes. 
I never actually built a tent before. 
There! 
I said it. 
You've been camping before, haven't you? 
Well, never outside... 
Well, why didn't you ask your dad how to build a tent? 
I don't think he wants to talk about this stuff. 
Try him sometime, maybe he'll surprise you. 
He's away a lot, I don't see him much. 
He's gotta be home sometime. 
I call, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much. 
Phyllis? 
You call your own mother by her first name? 
- Phyllis isn't my mom. - Oh! 
But he promised he'd come to my Explorers Ceremony to pin on my" Assisting the elderly badge". 
So he can show me how about the tent then, right? 
Hey, why don't you get some sleep? 
We don't want to wake the travelling flea circus. 
Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner. 
We have to protect him. 
Can Kevin go with us? 
All right, he can come. 
Promise you won't leave him? 
Yeah. 
Cross your heart? 
Cross my heart. 
What have I got myself into, Ellie? 
Good morning, sweetheart. 
We'd better get moving. 
The bird's gone. 
Maybe Russell won't notice. 
All right, everybody up! Where's Kevin? 
He's wondered off! 
- Dug, find Kevin! 
- Find the bird, find the bird! 
Point! 
Oh, look! 
There he is... 
Point! 
Hey, that's my food! 
Get off my roof! 
Yeah, get off of his WROOF! 
What is he doing? 
The bird is calling to her babies. 
Her babies! 
Kevin is a... girl? 
Her house is over there, on those twisty rocks. 
She's been gathering food for her babies and must get back to them. 
Wait, Kevin is just leaving. 
But you promised to protect her. 
Her babies need her. 
We gotta make sure they're together. 
Sorry, Russell. We've lost enough time already. 
Yeah... 
It was her favorite chocolate. 
Because you sent her away, there's more for you. 
Kevin? 
Where's the bird? 
You said you had the bird! 
Oh, yes, oh, yes. 
If I had said that, 
I can see how you would think that. 
Where is it? Oh, tomorrow. 
Come back tomorrow and then I will again have the bird. 
You lost it. why do I not have a surprised feeling? 
Well, at least you now have led us to the small mailman and to the one that smells as prunes. 
The master will be most pleased we have found them. 
He will ask them many questions. 
Come. 
Wait! 
We're not going with you. 
We're going to the fall. 
Get away from me! 
Down! 
You came here... in that? 
Yeah. 
In a house? 
A floating house? 
That is the darnest thing I've ever seen! 
You're not after my bird, are you? 
But if you need to borrow a cup of sugar, I'd be happy to oblige! 
Well, this is all a misunderstanding. 
My dogs made a mistake. 
Wait. 
Are you Charles Muntz? 
Well... yes. 
THE Charles Muntz? 
Adventure's out there! 
It's really him! 
That's Charles Muntz! 
It is? 
Who's Charles Muntz? Him! 
Carl Fredricksen. 
My wife and I, we were your biggest fans. 
Oh, well, you're a man of good taste. 
Now you must be tired. 
Hungry? 
Attention, everyone! 
These people are no longer intruders. 
They are our guests. 
Yeah! 
All right! 
I like you temporarily. 
I will not bite you. 
The small mailman smells like chocolate! 
I'm sorry about the dogs, 
I hope they weren't too... rough on you. 
Go ahead and pull your airship right next to mine. 
We are not actually going inside the" Spirit of Adventure" itself? 
Oh, would you like to? 
Would I? 
Wait up, Mr. Muntz! 
Jiminy Cricket! 
- Not you! 
- What do we do with Dug? 
He lost the bird. 
Put him in" the cone of shame". 
I do not like" the cone of shame". 
Most of the collection is housed in the world's top museums : 
New York, Münich, London. 
Of course, I kept the best for myself. 
Did you ever. 
Look at that! 
Oh, yes. 
The Arseloterium. 
The beast charged while I was brushing my teeth. 
I used my shaving kit to bring it down. 
Oh, yeah, now, surprise me. 
The only way to get it out of Ethiopia at the time was to have it declared technical weapon. 
Oh, my Gosh! 
The giant Somalian Labradodis! 
Oh, you recognize it? 
I'm impressed! 
There's an interesting story there. 
Excellent choice. 
I found it on safari, with Roosevelt. 
He and I fell into a habit of playing Gin Rummy in the evenings and did he cheat! 
He was horrible. 
Master, dinner is ready. 
Oh, dear, broken translator. 
I think it's that loose wire again. 
- There you go, big fellow. 
- Thank you, master. 
I liked his other voice. 
Well, dinner is served. 
Right this way. 
So, how are things States side? 
Almost tempted to go back a few times. 
But I have unfinished work here. 
Please! 
I hope you're hungry. 
Because Epsilon is the finest chef I've ever had. 
Epsilon, you've done it again! 
Yeah! 
Hey! 
Hey! 
My Ellie would have loved all these. 
You know, because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by the fall. 
I'm honored. 
And now you've made it. 
You sure we're not a bother? 
I'd hate to impose. 
No, no, it's a pleasure to have guests. 
A real treat. 
Treat? 
Where's my treat? 
I want my treat! 
Hey! 
I shouldn't have used that word. 
Having guests is a delight! 
More often I get thieves trying to steal what is rightfully mine. 
No... 
They called me a fraud, those... 
But once I bring back this creature, my name will be cleared. 
Beautiful, isn't it? 
Oh, I've spent a lifetime tracking it. 
Sometimes, years go by between seeings. 
I've tried to smoke it out of that death land where it lives. 
Can't go in after it. 
Once in, there's no way out. 
I lost so many dogs. 
Here they come those bandits and think the bird is theirs to take! 
They'll soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place. 
Hey, that looks like Kevin! 
- Kevin? 
- Yeah, that's my new giant pet bird! 
I trained it to follow us. 
Follow you? 
Impossible. 
How? 
She likes chocolate. 
- Chocolate? - Yeah. 
I gave her some of my chocolate. 
She goes gaga for it. 
But it ran off. Let's go now. 
You know, Carl... these people who pass through here, they all tell pretty good stories 
A surveyor making a map... 
A botanist cataloguing plants... 
An old man taking his house to Paradise Falls. 
That's the best one yet. I can't wait to hear how it ends. 
Well, it's been a wonderful evening, but we'd better be going. 
You're not leaving. 
We don't want to take advantage of your hospitality. 
Come on, Russell. 
But we haven't even had dessert yet. 
Oh, the boy is right. 
You haven't had dessert. 
Epsilon here makes a delicious cherries jubilee. 
You really must stay! 
I insist! We have so much more to talk about! 
Kevin? 
It's near. 
Get them! 
- Hurry! 
- Kevin! 
Dogs! Hurry! 
Master! Over here! 
Don't fall behind, master! 
Left! 
Russell! 
Get back! 
Go on, master! 
I will stop the dogs! 
Stop, you, dogs! 
Help! 
Give me your hand! 
Hang on to Kevin! 
Kevin! 
No, no, no. 
Kevin... Stay down. 
She's hurt real bad. 
Can't we help her get home? 
All right. 
But we gotta hurry. 
- You lost them? 
- No, it was Dug. 
Yeah, he's with them. 
he helped them escape! 
Wait. 
Wait a minute. 
Dug. 
- See anything? 
- No, my pack is not following us. 
Boy, they are dumb! 
This is crazy. 
I finally meet my childhood hero and he's trying to kill us. 
- What a joke. 
- Hey, I know a joke! A squirrel walks up up to a tree and says : 
" I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead". 
It is funny because the squirrel gets dead. 
Careful, Russell. You ok, Kevin? 
You know what, Mr. Fredricksen? 
The wilderness isn't quite what I expected. 
Yeah? 
How so? 
It's kind of... wild. 
I mean, it's not how they made it sound in my book. 
Get used to that, kid. 
My dad made it sound so easy. 
He is really good at camping, and how to make fire from rocks and stuff... 
He used to come to all my squad lodge meetings. 
And afterwards, we go get ice-cream that fattens. 
I always get chocolate and he gets butter brickle. 
Then we sit on this one curve, right outside and I'll count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones and whoever gets the most wins. 
I like that curve. 
It might sound boring, but I think the boring stuff is the stuff I remember the most. 
Look, there it is! 
Hold on, Russell, stand still. 
Look at that bird go! 
Wait up, you overgrown chicken! 
That's it! 
Go, Kevin! 
Go find your babies! 
Run, Kevin, run! 
Oh, no! 
Russell, give me your knife! 
Get away from my bird! 
No! 
No! 
Careful, I want it in good shape for my retirement. 
Let it go! 
Stop! 
Kevin! 
You gave away Kevin. 
You just... gave her away. 
This is none of my concern. 
I didn't ask for any of these! 
Master, it's all right. 
I am not your master! 
If you hadn't shown up, none of these would have happened. 
Bad dog, bad dog! 
Whether you assist me or not, 
I am going to Paradise Falls, if it kills me! 
Here 
I don't want this anymore. 
Russell? - Russell! 
- I'm gonna help Kevin even if you won't! 
No, Russell, no! 
Russell? 
I was hiding under your porch because I love you. 
Can I stay? Can you stay? 
Well, you're my dog, aren't you? 
And I'm your master. 
You're my master? 
- Good boy, Dug! 
You're a good boy! 
Yes! 
Don't worry, Kevin, I'll save you. 
And they wouldn't believe me. 
Just wait till they get a look at you! 
Master. The small mailman has returned. 
What? 
Let me go! 
Where is your elderly friend? 
He's not my friend anymore. 
If you're here, Fredricksen can't be far behind. 
Where are you keeping Kevin? 
Let me go! 
Scream all you want, small mailman. 
None of your mailmen friends can hear you. 
I will unleash all my wilderness explorer training! 
Alfa, Fredricksen is coming back! 
Guard that bird. 
If you see the old man, you know what to do. 
Where are you going? 
I'm not finished with you! 
Nice talking with you. 
Where are you, Fredricksen?

You came back for Kevin! 
Let's go get her! 
I'm getting Kevin. 
You stay here. 
- But I wanna help! 
- I don't want your help. 
I want you safe. 
How do we get pass these dogs? 
Point! 
Kevin! 
Don't worry, Kevin. We are on our way. 
No one should be entering through these doors. 
Guard well that bird, my minions. 
What do we do now, Dug? 
Who wants the ball? 
Me, me, me! 
Go get it! 
I got it! 
I'm sorry, Kevin. 
Let's get you out of here. 
- Master, he's gone. - What's going on? 
- He's got the bird! - He ran off! 
Calm down! 
One at the time! 
I want to... help! 
Does anybody know where they are? 
Raid leaders! Bring down that house! 
Checking in! 
- Raid 2, checking in. 
- Raid 3, checking in. 
Target sighted. 
Come on, Kevin. 
Hi. 
Any last words, Fredricksen? 
Come on, spit it out! 
Enough! 
You cannot leave this place... alive! 
You're dead! 
Come on, Kevin. 
I'll have plenty of enjoyment for what I'm about to do to you. 
He wears the cone of shame! 
Not just continue sitting! 
Attack! 
No! 
Stop your laughing! 
Listen, you, dog, sit! 
Yes, Alfa. Alfa? 
I am not Alfa, he is... 
I can't do it. 
Russell... 
You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone! 
- Hey! 
Squirrel! 
- Squirrel? Where? 
I hate squirrels! 
- Dug! 
- Master! 
Russell, over here! 
Let's go! 
Mr. Fredricksen! 
Come on, Kevin. 
No! 
Russell, get out of there! 
Leave them alone! 
Russell, hang on to Kevin! 
Don't let go! Grab on to him! 
Kevin! 
Chocolate! 
That was cool! 
Don't jerk around so much, kid. 
Easy, Russell. 
Oh, I am ready to not be up high. 
Sorry about your house, Mr. Fredricksen. 
You know... 
It's just a house. 
You're so soft! 
I wish I could keep one. 
I just had it here. 
Keep them. 
A little gift from me to you.

SPIRIT OF ADVENTURE 
Alright you two. 
That's enough. 
I like her. 
I think she likes you. 
What tells you that mum? 
Here you go mum. 
This is such a nice day. 
Who knows this? 
May those who love you, 
Be like the sun when it rises in its strength. 
Corinthians? 
Judges 5 : 31. 
So grandma, how old are you again? 
Never mind. 
You know you shouldn't ask for the age... 
That's very nice! 
Save some for me, will you? 
That's very nice! 
Who's that from? 
From you and Mary! 
You are correct! 
I was just testing. 
Remember mum? 
We were at the mall 
And you said you liked that. 
So I went back and I got it for you. 
Nancy honey, get me my purse. 
Why am I always the one to ask to get the purse? 
Youngest Griffith girl's the purse mule. 
Oh grandma.Open mine. 
Why do I have to be the purse mule? 
Ok. 
Fine. 
Yes, I think it suits me. 
What do you guys think? 
Grandma, that is a lovely shade of lipstick. 
Beautiful! 
Ed stop it. 
Why? 
What's wrong mum? 
It's disgusting. 
If you ask me, 
Queers should all be lined up and shot. 
Didn't you say that last year about the giants? 
What did you say? 
Never mind. 
What is this? 
It's a journal. 
Like a diary. 
I don't need any more stuff. 
Mum! 
- What? 
- I'll go. 
It's a good thing we didn't get you the pen. 
You can't take it personal. 
It's grandma. 
You know the rules. 
She's mean sometimes. 
Then we get a free pass to make fun of her. 
Bobby, she picks at me. 
Nobody ever picks on you. You're the favorite. 
So what's it like to be perfect? 
I'm perfect? 
You think I'm perfect? 
Have you looked in a mirror lately? 
You're Charlie's next angel, ok? 
Can I have it? 
You don't want it. 
Well, I'm taking it. 
I'm gonna fill this up in a week. 
Come on. 
Let's go celebrate grandmas' 39-39 birthday. 
I am ready. 
What? 
I wanna go further. 
Is... Is something wrong? 
I thought you'd want to... 
Here? 
I mean, this isn't really what I had in mind. 
It doesn't have to be here. 
I should go. 
I have to get up early tomorrow. 
Is something wrong? 
I don't think this is gonna work. 
I think we should break up. 
I thought you liked me... 
I came to meet your family. 
I just don't want to get that serious. 
Well, it doesn't have to be serious, ok? 
It's not you, it's me. 
I'm sorry. 
You wanna watch with me? 
I'm tired. 
Oh come on! 
Who else can I get to watch an old black and white movie? 
You know if it's not John Wayne, your dad's not interested. 
It's really scary. 
You know this scene's famous? 
Really? 
You know they got that glass of milk to glow? 
How? 
Well hitchcock put a lightbulb inside the glass so 
The audience would know the milk was poisonous. 
No kidding. 
That's clever. 
How do you know that? 
Cause I'm brilliant. 
You are brilliant! 
Take it away ; I'm eating too much. 
I think there's something wrong with me. 
That's for sure. 
What you think mum would do if she 
Found out one of us was a psychoptath? 
What you mean" if"? 
You know she's always saying... 
The whole family's gonna be together in the afterlife? 
What if one of us is a sinner? 
Have you sinned with Michelle? 
I promise I won't tell. 
It's not that. 
I'm just... 
Thinking about stuff, you know? 
You think too much. 
It's dangerous. 
That's why I avoid it at all cost. 
Yeah? 
I'm glad we talked. 
Seriously, something... Something wrong? 
No. 
Relax, cause I'm your big bro. I'm just looking out for you. 
What's up Bobby? 
Ready to go? 
Hey Bobby. 
Cheryl. 
She's not your type, too much eye shadow. 
What's wrong with Michelle? 
We broke up. 
Talk to you guys later. 
Not telling the truth... 
Sometimes I feel like I'm at the edge of a cliff, 
Looking down at the crashing surf 
With nowhere to go but down. 
I used to have these fun dreams when I was so free. 
But now, as I fly, 
I'm afraid. 
They are telephone lines and electrical wires. 
How painful it would be to run into one. 
I wonder if I'll ever be free again. 
Hello? 
Bobby? 
Bobby? 
Hey! Bobby? What did you do? 
Did you take these? 
Answer me! 
No! 
Is that the truth? 
I couldn't do it, ok? 
Get off me. 
I wanted to but I couldn't. 
What's wrong with you? 
Why I couldn't do it? 
Because it's a sin. 
Bobby, what are you talking about? 
I didn't wanna go to hell, but... 
I am. 
Cause this is worse. 
Bobby, you're scaring me. 
What's going on? 
You'd all hate me. 
I know it. 
I know that if you guys 
Knew the truth, you'd hate me. 
No. 
Whatever it is... 
We'll tell mum... 
No! 
No. 
Mum wouldn't understand. 
Ok? She can't know. 
Then you have to tell me right now. 
I'm not like you Ed. 
So what? 
I keep trying. 
I keep telling myself that one day I'm gonna wake 
Up and it's gonna be different. But it's not. 
I don't dream... 
About girls, like you do. 
I dream about guys. 
You're gay? 
! 
See? 
You even say it like you hate me. 
Bob, give me a break. 
I don't know what to do! 
- We'll tell mum and dad. 
- No! 
No. 
They can help, Bobby. 
They always want us to come to them. 
They can help. 
I can't! 
Ok? 
And you're not gonna say anything either. 
Promise me. 
Promise me you're not gonna say anything. 
Ed, promise! 
Ok. 
I promise. 
Mum, if there was something wrong with one of your kids, 
You always said that we should come to you... 
What did you do? 
It's not me, it's Bobby. 
What is it? 
I didn't want to tell you but he was... 
In such a bad shape, I'm really worried about him. 
He thinks... 
He might be homosexual. 
He's not. 
He didn't want me to tell you. He 
Was gonna take a bunch of aspirins. Ok? You know... 
He trusted me, you can't go too hard on him. Ok, good. 
It's good. 
I'm glad you told me. 
There's no doubt in my mind that god can handle this. 
He'll help us. 
He'll heal Bobby. 
In order for all of us to be 
Together in the kingdom of heaven, 
We cannot stray. 
We can't sin like that. 
That is a terrible sin. 
The bible calls it an abomination. 
In Leviticus, if a man lies with another man, 
They should both be put to death. 
I will not raise my family not 
Being together in the next life. 
Mary. 
Can we please worry about this life 
Before we worry about the next life? 
Hey. What's going on? 
Isn't there a problem you need to tell us about? 
- No... 
- Bobby 
If there is something wrong, you 
Need to share it with your family. 
- How could you? 
- Bobby... 
I'm gonna kill you! 
No! 
Ok, ok. Enough! 
I was worried about you! 
I trusted you! 
Calm down! 
Hey, Ed. 
Go find some room. 
Bobby, we're your family. 
We can get through this. 
I know that if we trust in god, we can get through this. 
It's curable with his help. 
I'm sorry. 
I can't help it. 
I don't even want it mum! 
What do I do? 
Bobby, you're not gay. 
You're probably just... 
You haven't met a girl that you're really attracted to. 
Please... 
Mum, please don't tell anyone please... 
- Mum, please don't tell anyone. 
- It's all right. 
It's gonna be fine. 
I was worried about you. 
What was I supposed to do? 
I'm out of here. 
Thank you again for joining us 
I'm pastor Raymond 
And we'll take another call, 
I advise you to live according to 
Your new life in the holy spirit 
Then you won't be doing... 
What your sinful nature craves. 
When the holy spirit controls your life, 
It will produce love, joy and kindness, 
Goodness and self-control. 
Does everyone have to know? 
We're your family. 
We love you. 
We still love you, bobby. 
Yeah, thanks, can i get some privacy? 
- Hi Mary! 
- Hi 
If a homosexual who wants to renounce homosexual reality 
Finds a psychiastrist who 
Knows how to cure homosexuality... 
He has every chance of becoming... 
A happy well adjusted heterosexual. 
Do you hear any voices? 
No. 
Do you ever hear any ringing sounds? 
No. 
Is that the phone? 
It was a joke. 
So you think you're a homosexual? 
Bobby, how many girls have you been with? 
I don't know. 
Two. 
Had sexual relations with? 
Then how do you know for sure? 
I just... 
Have these feelings, you know? 
I don't mean you know. I mean... 
I have these feelings. 
Do you want to be homosexual? 
I just wanna be close with my family again. 
I feel like I slipped up and now I can't... 
Get back. 
I'm not gonna be able to help you... 
If you don't answer my questions. 
No, I don't wanna be this way. 
I'm gonna talk with your mother alone for a minute, ok? 
She wants to talk to you. 
He can be cured. 
Right? 
He has to be willing to really put the work in. 
He is. 
I know he is. 
And I think it would be good, it would be important 
To have your husband come join us in therapy. 
Right... 
How did it go? 
She said we should spend some more time together. 
Maybe the two of you could spend 
Some quality time together. 
Yes, sure. 
That's all she said for 60 $ an hour? 
She also wants the 3 of us to go to a few sessions together. 
What? 
So it's our fault? 
No no... I don't know about it but it's fine if he goes. 
Bob, I want you to be a part of this. 
I can't do it alone, ok? 
I read that homosexuals have sex in public bathrooms, 
And that they recruit children. 
What are you saying? 
Do you think Bobby was recruited? 
Come on Mary, you're going overboard. 
You got to do something about this. 
I won't lose him. 
Dear lord, we ask that you keep Bobby safe from temptation. 
Please help him return to a pure heart. 
Do you think this will heal me? 
You have to trust the god will heal you. 
And that satan will try to discourage you. 
Do you trust in god? 
Yeah. 
Now let me go to sleep. 
When temptation is all around you, 
Faith is not enough. 
It requires discipline 
Not just mental, but physical. 
Who would like to share their story? 
I used to be so unhappy. 
I stayed out all night, 
I talked back to my mother. 
Since coming here and accepting jesus as my savior, 
I've changed.. 
My mum and I are like best friends now. 
That's great Kerry. 
The power of prayer and hard work. 
Bobby what about you? How are you coming along? 
Good... 
Well, you feel better. Don't you? 
I can see it in your eyes. 
Your hard works' paid off. Hasn't it? 
Yeah... 
Let's sing, shall we? 
Nothing I do seems to make a difference. 
I try to act like them but it feels impossible. 
It's an awful feeling to believe you can 
Be headed straight for the fires of hell. 
Even worse is everyone telling 
You how simple the solution is. 
They don't know what it is to be in my shoes. 
I'm running, I'm not eating junk food. 
Good, good! 
Yeah, that's good but... 
I don't know the point of it. 
I mean, my face has cleared up but 
Everything else feels the same. 
Well you have to stick with it. 
Do you like the people in your group? 
They're ok. 
This one girl, she... 
You know, I hope you're taking this seriously. 
I mean that I hope you are trying with all your might. 
I cannot lose you to this. 
You won't. 
Have faith! 
Well this is gonna be fun. 
When was the last time all the 
Griffith men went hiking together? 
So how's school? 
Good. 
You thought about your plans? 
Well college... 
No, I mean... 
Life plans. 
Well, I'm still thinking of becoming a writer. 
Listen Bobby, you always had a strong imagination. 
And we've always been alright with that. 
But you're getting to the age where 
You're gonna have to get practical. 
Alright, dreams... 
They're great when you're young, but... 
They don't really have... 
Really have a place in the real world. 
Yeah. 
You hear what I'm saying to you? 
- yeah. - alright, alright. 
Le'ts go, let's move. 
Alright. 
How did it go? 
I'm" healed". 
It was fine. 
Did you two talk? 
Yeah, we talked. 
What did you talk about? 
Mary, it was fine. 
No, but this is important. 
This could make him or break him. 
I did the best I could. Is that alright with you? 
A lot of times, confusions like Bobby's 
Can be caused by a distant father or an overbearing mother. 
Well, I had both but I'm fine. 
Bob? 
You need to participate in this. 
I'm right here Mary. 
I'm in the room. 
I think... 
I've been a very good father. 
And maybe you don't know this but Bobby. 
I mean he was never into... 
The stuffs his brother or other boys into it. 
He's just not interesting. 
So i am not gonna force him. 
Hi Bobby I'm Sheila. 
Mum, who's that? 
Sheila is a student in my sunday school class. 
You got me a date? 
You need to go out with lots of girls. 
And your dad thinks so too. 
Can I at least pick my own? 
Do not thing your arm. 
Have fun. 
You look nifty. 
Do you want a brownie for energy? 
take them up! 
No? ! 
Hello. 
Who's this? 
That's my brother ed. 
- Hi. 
- Hi, I'm Sheila. 
- Nice to meet you. 
- Nice to meet you too. 
- Are you up to see my friends? 
- Yeah! 
So you're never gonna talk to me again? 
Look at where you got me. 
What if she wants me to kiss her goodnight? 
Tell her you're gay. 
Watch out fag. 
Did you tell your friends? 
Bobby, that's not my friend. 
You told everyone I'm gay? 
I haven't told anyone. 
Stop being so paranoid. 
You all hate me for it. 
I know you don't think I see it but I do. 
I gotta go. 
Bobby... 
It's 3 in the morning! 
Sorry I lost track of time. 
Where were you? 
Bobby... 
You weren't with homosexuals, were you? 
This is not you. 
This is temptation working its ways. 
You have to pray harder if you're going to get well. 
Good night, mum. 
Pray for forgiveness right away. 
It was fine, girls. But I gotta go. 
Ok. 
Bobby! 
Hey! 
Where's Joy? 
She's at work so she asked me to pick you up. 
You're welcome. 
- what's with you? 
- what? 
You think I didn't notice that? 
You don't want your friends to see me. 
Some people wouldn't understand. 
And now it's so obvious... 
What did you tell them? 
Well look the way you're wearing. 
And I told you time after time not 
To do that thing with your arm. 
Makes you look like a girl and you continue to do it. 
- I'm always dressed this way. - no, 
You haven't. It's gotten worse. 
Why you're doing this? 
I'm trying to help you. 
No, you're not. 
You're trying to help you it's not about me. 
It's 
About what people think about you. 
Imagine that they thought your son is some big queen 
What's wrong with you? 
Stop that! 
- Nice mum, great - le'ts go home! 
- I'm walking. 
- No! 
Where are you going? 
I haven't seen you around here before. 
You are really beautiful. 
I gotta go. 
Can I call you? 
No. 
Bobby... 
Don't worry. 
I was at church. 
- Hi cousin 
- I have a name. It's gorgeous cousin. 
So, how long you're here for? 
Just a day, I'm driving home tonight. 
I came to see my dad. But I couldn't resist stopping by. 
Maybe it's not a choice. 
Maybe I just can't help it. 
So you say that stealing's not a choice. 
What? 
Aunt Mary, lunch is delicious. 
Joy's right, Bobby. 
The bible says men committed shameless acts with men and received 
In their own's person the due penalty for their error." 
You just won't change, will you? 
I can't erase what's in the bible. 
Personnally, I think people should 
Be able to love whoever they want. 
Did I mention how good lunch is? 
Even animals know what to do it with. 
Actually, our dog does it with a pillow... 
Can we please find something different to discuss? 
Ed, why don't you tell us about college? 
I dropped school last week. 
You what? 
Well, what about college? 
I'm not going. 
Great! 
What's next? 
You wanna ruin your life? 
Yeah well it's my life to ruin. 
Is it like this at every meal? 
Pretty much. 
You should come up and visit me in Portland. It's so great! 
I used to envy you.. 
When I came here with mum and dad, I always 
Wished your parents were my parents. 
You all seemed so close. 
Well that's over with. 
I think they love the sinners. 
Not the sin. 
They should love the son no matter what the sin. 
Hey that's good. 
I'm gonna start my own bible. 
Think about coming to Portland? 
Hi Mrs. Griffith! 
Is bobby here? 
Bobby! 
You know it's enough you go 
God knows where are you at night. 
But now you're bringing these 
Deviants into my house. 
It's my house too. 
And they're my friends. 
Is that what that boy is? 
Is it a sin to have friends now too Mum? 
We have a good time, ok? 
We go to the rock choir together. 
Does it mean we're all gonna get strucked down? 
They're gay, aren't they? 
I thought you were getting better. 
When? 
When I was miserable? 
That looked like I was getting better? 
You're right Mum! 
I'm doomed just to roast in hell! 
Don't say that. 
That's what your bible says! 
The bible also says a person can change. 
I tried Mum. I can't! 
Why do you keep choosing this? 
Why would I choose this? 
Why would I choose to have my entire family hate me? 
No we love you. 
Can't you see that's why we're doing this? 
Really mum? 
Is that what love feels like? 
Have fun in Portland. 
Here's an issue for your vacation. 
I hope you like it. 
Promise me you'll write and call all the time? 
It's two months. 
Drive carefully. 
Don't worry madam. 
You call me when you get to Portland. 
I had this engraved with your initials. 
I love you guys. 
Bye Bobby. 
Already I'm glad to be away from Walnut Creek. 
This feels like a new life. 
A new day. 
I'm gonna be a success in every way I can. 
It's my goal to achieve, 
A sense of pride, 
And worth as a human being. 
Gorgeous cousin. 
Welcome to Portland! 
Trust me... 
You don't find clubs like this back home. 
I'll see. 
Welcome to London house cousin. 
This is amazing! 
Let's go boogie. 
David! 
Janette! 
This is my cousin Bobby. 
Nice to finally meet you Bobby! 
So Janette tells me your mum wants 
To cure you of your gayness. 
Yeah, well... 
My parents don't really understand it. 
Do yours? 
They didn't first. 
But, they eventually came around. 
How did you get them to change? 
Well, one day, 
I told them accept what I am, or forget it. 
I know my Mum means well, but I 
Don't know if she'll ever accept me. 
Just don't stop trying. 
Have a great trip. 
Don't let her get to you. 
And don't be afraid to stand up to her. 
Too much flew by fast. 
I'll call you when I get home. 
You'd better. 
Well. Look who's home. 
- Hey Dad. 
- Hey, come here, come here. 
Just in time for dinner. 
Come on in. 
That's funny. 
So how was Portland? 
Portland was great. 
Good! 
I'm thinking of maybe moving there 
For a little bit. 
Moving there? 
I met someone... 
A guy. 
Girls... 
Give me a hand with this. 
We're supposed to pretend we didn't hear that? 
Yes. 
Bobby... 
This might not have been the right time. 
I know. 
I'm sorry.. 
You should start thinking 
About college for next fall. 
You need to get your GED first. 
I mean... It's ok to take some time off but... 
Did you hear me? 
I don't wanna know. 
I want you to know. 
His name's David. 
We always start at the beginning every time 
And if we're not getting any more different let's just not go there. 
When I'm with him, 
It feels so... 
Good! 
He treats me well... 
He's funny and he's smart... 
Stop. I mean it. 
I don't wanna hear it. 
And you know I don't. 
I spent the last year listening to you 
And you're gonna listen to me for once. 
It feels good when I'm with David. 
But if he touches me in public, 
Or god forbids, kisses me, 
I pull away. 
I feel ashame. 
Because you know it's wrong. 
Because you told me it's wrong. 
It's not me. It's the bible. 
It's not the bible. It's you! 
Why can't you admit that? 
Why can't you admit that 
You can't stand what I am? 
What you've become! 
What I am! 
I'm sorry. I'm not the perfect 
Little Bobby you always wanted. 
But I can't keep apologizing for it Mum. 
Accept what I am, or forget it! 
I won't have a gay son. 
Then Mum you don't have a son. 
Fine. 
Bobby... 
Did you really think she'd change, Bobby? 
She meant it. 
She meant that. 
I really want you to be happy. 
And I'm sure that guy's really nice. 
No matter what. She'll never accept it. 
It's gonna be a lonely life because 
He'll never be welcome here. 
And for Christmas, Thanksgiving, anything. 
Don't worry about Mum too much. 
She'll come around. I'm not gonna hold my breath. Here you go. 
The parachute pants! 
Thanks. 
I'll send you my first novel when I write it. 
Bye buck-tooth! 
Take care, ok? 
Drive safe. 
... Most of the new cases up to 5 a day 
Seem to be settled in the homosexual community... 
The AIDS becoming known as the gay disease? 
Well... Your mum went a lot for your birthday. 
No card. 
A sweater and" AIDS - the wrath of God". 
Happy birthday! 
You can't expect anything different from her, Bobby. 
She's not gonna change. 
Birthdays were always a big deal for all of us. 
I'm just not in the all of us anymore. 
Can't get that throughout my head. 
There's David. 
Talk to you later. 
You sure this is ok? 
They're gonna love you. 
Let's go. 
Dad, do you have to tell that story? 
Hey, I felt I had to. 
Yes. And I've got about a dozen more where 
That came from if you're interested. 
Oh, oh no thanks. 
So Bobby... 
Tell us more about you. 
You grew up in Walnut Creek, right? 
David says you're very close to your family. 
Yeah. 
So how are your parents with you being gay? 
Not good. 
Maybe it's hard for them at first. 
They'll come around. 
You seem like a wonderful young man. 
I'm sure they love you. 
- Cheers to that! 
- Cheers to that! 
It's great to meet you Bobby. 
So how did you guys meet? 
You know Janette? 
... 
It's a sin. 
It's not natural. 
He'll never be welcome here. 
Why do you keep choosing this? 
Sometimes I hurt so bad... 
And I'm scared and I'm alone. 
I'm sure they love you. 
I'm damned. 
I'm slowly sinking in a vast lake of quick sand. 
A bottomless pool. 
I wish I could crawl under a rock 
And sleep forever. 
You've reached David. 
I'm not here right now but if you leave a message 
After the beep, I'll get right back to you. 
Have a good one... 
Hey David, it's Bobby. 
I thought you'd be there. 
Look I'm... 
I really need someone to talk to 
And I was hoping you'd be there. 
Please, Dear lord, 
Continue to convict Bobby's heart off sin. 
That he may find his way 
The way of purity, 
The way of the righteous. 
It's a sin. 
It's not natural. 
I won't have a gay son. 
You're gonna be late for school. 
You're the one who slept in. 
Ok, then we're both gonna be late for school. 
Meet you in the car. 
OK! 
Hello? 
Janette, what's wrong? 
No... 
What's wrong? 
No... 
What's wrong? 
Nancy, get out of here! 
Dad! 
Daddy... 
Hello. 
Hi. Hi, Janette... 
Mary, you've been called up front 
And he said to bring your purse. 
Probably one of the kids that needs money again. 
I need a break anyway. 
Bye. 
What is it? 
Bobby killed himself. 
He jumped off a bridge. 
He... He's gone. 
Help me! 
Help me! 
My son is dead! 
Let me out! 
Let me out! 
My son is dead! 
Let me out! 
Joy, slow down. 
What's wrong? 
Thank you. 
Death of a loved one is always tragic 
But the death of a young person 
Can be particularly painful. 
Because that person had his whole life ahead of him. 
Bobby was only 20 years old. 
We'll never know who he could have been. 
Or what he could have accomplished. 
Bobby was a good young man but he was lost. 
By giving into temptation, he strayed. 
Then disillusioned, 
He chose to end his life. 
Now we know to condemn the sin, 
Not the sinner, 
It was this sin that Bobby succombed to. 
It led to his unhappiness. 
And it led him 
To take his own life. 
As goodness begets goodness, 
So does sin begets sin. 
They're ok with this? 
They're running low on sandwiches. 
Mum, do you think Bobby got salvation? 
I don't know. 
Suicide is a sin. 
But maybe God knows that Bobby wasn't in his right mind? . 
I mean... Why would God allow Booby to go to hell 
If it was in his power to cure him? 
I don't know Mary! 
Clear yourself together. 
People are unconfortable enough. 
Thank for coming. 
I'm so sorry for your loss. 
Mrs Griffith. 
Mr. Griffith.. 
I'm David. 
I was a friend of Bobby's. 
I wanna offer my condolences. 
He was an amazing young man. 
I'm so sorry. 
Aunt Mary... 
David is a good person. 
All of Bobby's friends were. 
When Bobby was here, he was under control. 
Then he moves to Portland 
And someone puts all these ideas into his head. 
It wasn't like that. 
David cared for Bobby. 
We're his family. 
We know how to help me, 
He wanted to change, to be closer to god. 
To be closer to YOU! 
Then he went further and further into that life style 
And he couldn't get out. 
Do you believe everything they tell you in church? 
I know you and uncle Bob meant with that serment... 
Bobby knew the repercussions about homosexual lifestyle. 
Bobby was good, descent and kind. 
Someone who didn't even know Bobby 
Stood up there and condemned him, and you let him. 
Bobby did everything he could 
To make himself acceptable to you. 
He was so good, and bright, and funny. 
He should be praised. 
I'm sorry you can't see it that way. 
Maybe you should go. 
Fine. 
I left Bobby's things in his room. 
Bobby! 
Hey Mum! 
Don't you ever do that again! 
I knew it wasn't true. 
I knew God would bring you back to me. 
Mum, you worry too much. 
I'm slowly sinking in a vast lake of quick sands. 
A bottomless pool. 
I wish I could crawl under a rock and sleep forever. 
No one understands me. 
No one in this house can accept my side of the story. 
I can feel god's eyes looking down on me with pity. 
I can't never let anyone find out I'm not straight. 
It would be so humiliating... 
My friends would hate me. 
And my family... 
Mum 
I've overheard them. 
Thank you. 
They've said that they hate gays. 
And even God hates gays. 
It really scares me when they talk that way 
Because now they are talking about me. 
I don't wanna choose sin. 
I don't. 
I'm so mad and frustrated god... 
I seem to be at the end of the road. 
Why do you remain silent? 
May 30th. 
Memorial Day Barbecue. 
Had fun. 
Mum was sweet and funny self. 
Like the old Mum... 
For a second it felt like the old days. 
She smiled at something I said, 
And I saw on her eyes that for a second she forgot 
What she really thinks of me. 
The anger never erupts. 
My timid nature would never allow 
A full fledged thunderstorm to occur. 
But it's there, on the horizon. 
I can feel god's eyes looking down on me with such pity. 
He can't help me though. 
Because i've chosen sin over righteousness. 
Excuse me! 
You alright Ed? 
Oh yeah, I'm fantastic. I think we all are. 
Isn't that obvious? 
Ed. We have to deal with this as a family. 
That was your answer for Bobby too but it didn't work. 
Damned! 
I'll go. 
I'll go. 
Excuse me. 
Come, Nancy. 
You wanna get out of here, maybe go for a beer? 
Did he even think about what he would do to us? 
He could have called... 
Or something but... 
Not just screw us, right? 
Ed... 
Nothing no! 
No goodbye, no note, 
Nothing. Just... 
I'm sorry Bobby. 
I'm sorry. 
Are you happy now? 
I'm sorry Bobby. 
Are you happy now? 
Ed... 
It's not your fault. 
There must be other Bobbys out there. 
Other young gay people who may be thinking of taking their lives. 
Does the church reach out to them? 
There are other churches to do that. 
Reverend Joseph asked us to tell you 
How sorry he is for your loss. 
We can come back in a couple of weeks and check in on your f... 
You don't understand, do you... 
I don't know what to do. 
I need to make peace with this and I can't. 
The lord says the impure will be thrown into the lake of fire. 
Bobby... 
Sinned! 
But he was pure of heart. 
He'd never knowingly hurt anyone. 
Is that enough? 
Is it? 
Dear god, 
My relationship to you leaves something to be desired. 
I have never asked of you, 
Only given, as I was told. 
Your holy spirit has taught me so much... 
But now there's more I need to know. 
I can't. 
Ok. 
I think I'm gonna sleep in the living room. 
Reverend? 
Mary Griffith. 
Nice to have you with us, Mary. 
The bible... 
It says that homosexuality is a sin punishable by death. 
Do you believe that? 
There are other interpretations of the bible, Mrs Griffith. 
My son... 
Was gay... 
And he killed himself. 
Is there an other interpretation of that? 
I'm sorry. 
What was his name? 
Bobby. 
Bobby Griffith. 
I saw him here a couple of times. 
My Bobby? 
He always sat way in the back. 
He stopped coming. 
I am so sorry. 
You must be... 
I need answers. 
I need to know where he is. 
Is homosexuality an unforgivable sin? 
Leviticus, 18 : 22 says : 
If a man lies with another man, 
It is an abomination.? 
An abomination, in that time, didn't mean sin. 
It meant unclean. 
Leviticus also goes on to 
Say eating shellfish is an abomination. Or mixing fabrics... Leviticus 20 : 13 
If a man lies with another man, they both should be put to death.? 
And then he says the same thing about an adultere, 
Or a child that disobeys their parents. 
And we certainly don't interpret that scripture litteraly. 
In Deuteronomy 22, 
If a woman is not a virgin on her wedding day, 
She should be taken to her father's house and stoned to death.? 
So what do you tell people who come here? 
Gay people... 
That homosexuality is ok? 
That it is permissible in god's eyes? 
I tell them what I believe to be the truth : 
That God loves them as they are. 
God's vengeance is great. 
So is his compassion. 
You shouldn't teach them that homoseuxality is ok. 
That's not what the bible says. 
It just confuses them more. 
Mrs Griffith, 
If you'd like to come back during the week and talk, 
My door is open, 
But not to be blamed. 
Ok? 
I think that we got a pretty good one, 
Nice and full. 
A couple of balls like your dear old dad. 
Or grandma... 
Yeah... 
Mum, can we hang this one on the tree? 
I remember when he made this. 
Second grade. 
Mrs Towns' class, I think. 
He was so proud of himself. 
Where do you want to put it? 
Up high. 
So he can look out. 
Hey, they work. 
I'm gonna go check on my cookies. 
I found the passage you talked about. 
About stoning to death 
Deuteronomy, 22. 
But what about Sodom and Gommorah? 
God punishes the sin of homosexuality. 
How do you explain that? 
It's nice to see you too, Mary. 
What's this for? 
It's a roomish sale. 
All gay people have roomish too. 
So... What about Sodom and Gommorah? 
Many scholars think this sin was greed and not homosexuality. 
And it wasn't labeled homosexuality until years 
After it was written. 
Do you have answers for all these things 
Just to justify being that way? 
You have answers to justify that it's wrong. 
I guess we're in an impass here. 
So you think it's ok to interpret the bible 
Any way you want? 
No, of course not. 
But the bible was written and interpreted by mortal men. 
And many of those interpretations were reflections of the time 
And what they lived. 
So you feel completely free to question it? Because... I think it's blasphemous. 
I don't think God minds questions. 
He might not be thrilled with all our answers. 
I think blind faith is just as dangerous as none at all. 
I've never questioned my faith. I... 
I've never had reasons to. 
Sometimes to question it... 
Helps you find a deeper faith. 
Bobby stopped coming here. 
I think the reason was... 
He couldn't never allow himself to feel worthy of God's love. 
And we didn't help. 
Mary... 
Have you ever heard about P-FLAG? 
It's a national organisation. 
It's parents and friend of lesbians and gays? 
No, that's not for me. 
They could help. 
You'd be able to see you're not so alone in this. 
Bye Reverend. 
No. There's a woman in Concord, Betty Lambert. 
You'll love her. 
She has a gay son in his 30s. 
I just had a few questions. 
I don't need anything else. 
Just in case. 
It's true. 
There's a passage that says if children are disobedient 
They should be put to death. 
And I mean no one interprets that litteraly. What I'm saying is... If the church no longer interprets that litteraly, 
Maybe homosexuality is also on that list. 
Well, maybe. 
Well, don't you think that's important? 
Mary, I wasn't that keen with 
The first interpretation of the bible. 
Well, it could mean that Bobby's in heaven. 
Yeah, well, he's not here. Right? 
Why isn't that enough for you? 
Is it enough for you? 
! 
Does it make it any better? Everything you're doing? 
What do you want me to do? 
Just forget about him? 
I can't do that. 
Maybe you can. 
I don't wont to forget about him, Mary. 
I want to remember him. Then I want to move on. 
But I can't! 
Nobody can... 
Just walk away. Like you always do. 
You never deal with anything. 
Oh, I see... maybe 
Maybe if I did, Bobby would still be alive today? 
Is that what you're saying? Is that what you think? 
You can answer me! 
Listen Mary, we both made mistakes. 
We all made mistakes. 
But it's done, he's gone. 
We're not gonna bring him back. 
I know that! 
Don't you know I know that? 
! 
Hello. 
Betty Lambert. 
I'm so glad you called. 
Please, come in. 
Reverend Whitsell told me what happened to Bobby. 
I can't imagine what it must feel like to lose a child like that 
How long has it been? 
Six months... 
Six months and a few days. 
Our son was 14 when he came out to us. 
Isn't that a little young? 
I knew before then. 
We, mothers, we always know. Don't we? 
And you were ok with it? 
Oh god, no. 
I don't think any parent hears the news and thinks oh Goodie? 
Goodie Wasn't the first word that came to my mind. 
Mary... 
Why don't you come to a P-FLAG meeting with me? 
No, I'm... 
I'm not good at talking in groups. 
So don't talk. 
Just come and listen. 
I think you'll be shocked 
At how many people think they were the All-American-Family. 
I'll think about it. 
Eric was taunted in shcool all the time. 
Mary, you came. 
I can't stay long. 
That's great. Come on in. 
I was so furious, I went to the principal. 
But he didn't do a thing to the boys who did it. 
I was shocked by that. 
I called them fruits, and ferries. 
I didn't know. 
It took me a long time to accept my Sam. 
I think I alway knew. I mean... He asked for a pink Lacoste shirt for his birthday. 
He was always different. 
So he tells me he's gay... 
What do I do? 
I take him hunting. 
There he is in his pink Lacoste shirt, 
He saw a deer and yaled run, Bambi, run? 
I always knew I could love my son 
I never thought I could accept him. For who he is. 
Well, when Gil told me she was gay. 
I insisted she see a psychiastrist. 
But when that man suggested shock therapy, 
I looked at my baby and, the hurt in her eyes. 
I thought this is crazy! ? 
Ah, hello reverend! 
Please, come sit down. 
- Hi guys! 
- Hi reverend! 
Glad to see you're all here tonight. 
As you may know, Reverend Whitsell is 
A pastor of the Metropolitan Community Church, 
And he's proposing a gay freedom day 
To the Walnut Creek city council. 
The city council vote happens in about a month. 
And I would love all your support. 
Mary! 
Mary? 
Mary, what are you doing out here? 
You're soak. Come inside. 
I didn't know where else to go. 
I was sitting there, 
Listening to all their stories. 
About how they... 
Always just knew... 
Their kid was different. 
And then I had this dream tonight... 
Bobby was a baby. 
My son was always different. 
His difference began at conception. 
I knew that. 
I felt it. 
I know now... 
Why God didn't heal Bobby 
He didn't heal him because... 
There was nothing wrong with him. 
I did this! 
I killed my son! 
You did not kill your son. 
Bobby killed himself. 
How could God forgive me? 
How could Bobby forgive me? 
God has already done the forgiving. 
You have to forgive yourself. 
I'm so sorry! 
I'm so sorry! 
Dear god. 
Give us something we can live with 
And pass on to others whose lives will never be the same 
Because of a loved one's death. 
I did not decide on brown eyes for myself. 
And I now realize that Bobby didn't decide to be gay. 
If you say in your word 
That it is evil and wicked to be born with no arms, 
And a child is born with no arms, 
What is that child to think? 
Our first order business is a proposal 
For a gay freedeom day in Walnut Creek. 
Attention, please. 
We have a select group to debate the issue. 
- I don't see her. -... it's reverend Whitsell. 
For one day, For one day, People can celebrate their difference rather than feel shame. 
Hey should be ashame! 
There are so many other people 
Who need our time and our attention. 
Why are we wasting it on this? 
Alright, alright. Let's have some order here please. 
They spit in the face of decency and morality. 
We cannot allow the fabric of our society to be torn apart. 
Right? 
I heard he tries to run for the Human Relations commission, 
They picked that limped Whitsell instead. 
They sent him a letter. 
I said,' We sing hymns at our church'. 
What do you do with the hymns at your church? 
So unless anyone else has anything else to add, 
We'll adjourn to make our decision. 
Mary? 
Hey Dad! 
Dad, get in here! 
Dad hurry up! Mum's on TV. 
Homosexuality is a sin. 
Homosexuals are dommed to spend eternity in hell. 
If they wanted to change, 
They could be healed of their evil ways. 
If they would turn away from temptation, 
They could be normal again. 
If only they would try and try harder, 
If it doesn't work. 
These are all the things I said to my son Bobby 
When I found out he was gay. 
When he told me he was homosexual, 
My world fell apart. 
I did everything I could 
To cure him of his sickness. 
8 months ago, my son... 
Jumped off a bridge and killed himself. 
I deeply regret my lack of knowledge about gay and lesbian people. 
I see that everything I was taught and told 
Was bigotry and dehumanizing slender. 
If I had investigated, beyond what I was told, 
If I had just, 
Listened to my son, 
When he poured his heart out to me... 
I would not be standing here today with you 
Filled with regrets. 
I believe 
That God was pleased with Bobby's kind and loving spirit. 
In god's eyes kindness and love are what it's all about. 
I didn't know that each time 
That I echoed eternal damnation for gay people... 
Each time I referred to Bobby 
As sick and perverted and a danger to our children... 
His self-esteem, 
His sense of worth, were being destroyed. 
And finally, 
His spirit broke beyond repair. 
It was not god's will 
That Bobby climbed over the side of a freeway overpass 
And jumped directly into the path of an 18 wheel truck 
Which killed him instantly. 
Bobby's death was the direct result 
Of his parents' ignorance and fear of the word gay. 
He wanted to be a writer. 
His hopes and dreams should not have been taken from him But they were. They are children like Bobby, 
Sitting in your congreggations, 
Unknown to you, 
They will be listening, 
As you echo Amen 
And that will soon silence their prayers. 
Their prayers to god, for understanding, 
And acceptance, 
And for your love. 
But your hatred, and fear, 
And ignorance of the word Gay will silence those prayers 
So... 
Before you echo Amen In your home and place of worship. 
Think! 
Think and remember. 
A child is listening. 
Oh, Mum... 
Should be good. 
He lost. 
They voted the order install. 
Well, he'll try again next year, right? 
So, we're really going to San Francisco? 
I think we have to. 
I don't think that's a choice. 
That's ironic. 
Ok. 
Are we late? 
Just in time! 
Just in time. 
Jacky, is this everyone? 
Oh! Honey, no... 
Come with me. 
We have a special place for you. 
Ok. 
To all the Bobby and Janes out there... 
I say these words to you as I would with my own precious children. 
Please don't give up hope on life. 
Or yourselves. 
You're very special to me. 
I'm working very hard to make this world a better and safer place 
For you to live in. 
Promise me you'll keep trying. 
Bobby gave up on love. 
I hope you won't. 
You're always in my gods. 
My name is Bobby Griffith. 
I write this in hope that one day, 
Many years from now, 
I would be able to go back 
And remember what my life was like, 
When I was a young and confused adolescent, 
Desperately trying to understand myself in the world I live in 
The other reason I write this, so long after I died, 
Others may have a chance to read about me, 
And see what my life as a young person was like. 
On December 6th 1995, Mary Griffith testified 
Before members of the Congress of the United States. 
Her tireless work protecting the rights of gay and lesbian youth 
Has established her as a major force 
In the fight for human rights. 
Before you echo Amen in your home or place of worship, 
Think and remember. 
A child is listening. 
- Mary Griffith 
In loving memory of Bobby Griffith and Leroy Aarons 
What was that? 
Honey, are the kids up? 
What are they doing? 
I peed. 
Kevin peed the bed. 
Our bed? Uh-huh. 
All 500 thread counts of Egyptian cotton. 
- I'm sorry. 
- You're sorry? 
I don't want you to worry about it, buddy. 
It'll happen again your freshman year of college, trust me. 
No more sodas before bed! 
Sit down here. 
But I like soda. 
How you doing, big guy? 
Good morning. 
Let's have a big morning! 
Let's start off with a little breakfast, get our Froot Loops. 
Here's Daddy's coffee. 
And I need it. 
Here's your bowl of fruit, without the loops. 
Why no loop? 
Daddy doesn't need loops. 
I gotta eat it. 
If I eat a big meal now, then I can watch what I eat later. 
Otherwise, I'll get starved and raid the refrigerator. 
Okay, honey. 
We've got to hurry up,'cause we got to go to hockey. 
I thought you could do that because I might try to get a little bit of work done today. 
Honey, we have to go by the showroom and pick out the tile. 
I want you to see it. 
We talked about this last week and I told you how important today was for me. 
I'm Mega Man! 
May the best team win! 
Okay, guys, let's keep it down. 
Keep the eyes on the... 
On the screen. 
You guys doing good? 
- Yes. 
Honey? 
Yeah. 
What do you think? 
Nickel, brushed nickel, chrome or brushed chrome? 
I like the silver ones. 
They're all silver. 
Well, great. 
Pick out whichever knob that you like, then. 
No, I'm not gonna pick whichever knob I like because you know what's gonna happen? 
Is that I'm gonna pick one and then you're gonna complain once they're in and then it'll be too late. 
Hello? 
Dave, where the heck have you been? 
I'm picking out pulls. 
Why have you been calling me nonstop? 
Well, you know how my credit's all screwed up because of my wife? 
But you're divorced. 
I need you to cosign for my motorcycle. 
What motorcycle? 
I'm buying a motorcycle. 
Shane, you have no money. 
Why in the world would you be buying a motorcycle that you can't afford? 
Dave, you're white. 
You can't understand this. 
This is something different. 
Don't play the race card with me, Froot Loop. 
I'll take him in. 
You stay with Kevin, okay? 
Okay. 
All right, go ahead. 
Have fun, champ. Go get' em, buddy. 
You should see this thing. 
It's awesome. 
Even Trudy loves it. 
Who's Trudy? 
That's my girlfriend. 
Girl from the mall? 
She's 20 years old, Dave. 
Let's go. Let's move it. I got bikes to move. 
Listen, Shane. 
You are not buying some 20-year-old broad a motorcycle. 
I'm not buying her anything, it's for me! 
Daddy, what's taking so long? 
Hey, baby, I'm on the phone, and I would prefer it if you didn't call me that in public. 
But I call all my boyfriends Daddy! 
Dave, you gotta do this for me. 
Why don't you just lease it? 
No, she'll know. 
Who will know? 
She's a kid. 
Buy her a Hello Kitty book. 
Get her an assignment notebook and put rainbow stickers in it. 
You don't have to buy her a motorcycle. 
Did you or did you not say," Move on"? 
I told you to try to work it out. 
Joey's the one who told you to move on. 
Can you give me a minute? 
Try to make it fast, Daddy. 
Dave, I'm hurting. 
I would love for my wife to come back. 
But we know that's not gonna happen. 
It's nice to feel appreciated. 
I need this for me. 
Fine. 
Just text me the address. 
Okay? 
Pick out a helmet, baby! 
Daddy! 
So, honey, this is the tile. 
It's all gonna happen at once and I really need you to dial in. 
Sweetheart, I'll help you. 
I want a sugar cone. 
I'm gonna hit you after this, buddy. 
Okay. 
Honey, you work from 8 : 00 to 8 : 00. 
You're not gonna be helping anyone. 
Hang on, honey, okay? 
It's just really busy right now because the video game ships this month. 
Now that I have you, I just want you to dial in and tell me what you really think. 
It's fine. 
Do you love it? 
As much as I can love tile, I love this tile. 
Okay, good,' cause it's $ 1,000. 
Really? Mmm-hmm. 
Is that installed? 
Nope, just the tile. 
Well, what is it made out of? 
Whale tusks? 
No, it's not made out of whale tusks. 
This is so boring. 
Give me just one second. 
Let me just grab this. 
Honey? 
We have to do this today. 
Hello? 
Hello, Dave. 
Joey? 
Yeah, hey. 
Look... 
Just one second, that's it. 
... what are you doing about the Jason thing? 
If it's Joey, can you ask him if he's coming to the party? 
Are you... 
Are you coming to the party on Sunday? 
Yeah, yeah, I'll be there. 
Yeah, he's coming, all right? 
Give me one second. 
Stay with Mom. 
One second. 
Jason's gonna be calling you, all right? 
He's got another one of his PowerPoint deals that... 
Hold on one second. 
Hello? 
Hey, Dave, it's Jason. 
Listen, I'd love to put something on the books with you and Ronnie. 
Are you gonna make it to Kevin's birthday on Sunday? 
Yes, I am. 
Now, listen, I was hoping that you guys would come down here to the firm because Cynthia and I have a PowerPoint presentation that would just play gangbusters in the conference room. 
Okay, okay, hold on one second. 
It's ringing. 
Hello? 
Why'd you hang up on me? 
I didn't hang up on you. 
You're on hold. 
He's trying to get me to see another one of his PowerPoint things. 
That stuff creeps me out. 
It's just how he communicates. 
He's... 
He's, you know... 
He's overly efficient. 
Well, I don't like hearing about ball cancer, let alone looking at diagrams. 
Joey, he was scared. 
Tell him I'm not going. 
I ain't telling him you're not going. 
You know, I got him on the other line. 
You can tell him yourself. 
Hold on. 
I don't want to... 
I don't... 
Hello, Jason? 
Yeah. 
I got Joey on the line. 
Hey, Joey, I've left you a bunch of voice mail messages all morning. 
Well, we haven't even set a time yet, you know. 
If you'd listened to the voice mail, you'd know that this is just a feeler call to check your temperature on schedule. 
I'm not sitting through another slide show about ball cancer. 
Listen, pal, I'm alive today because of early detection, all right? 
Is this about ball cancer? 
" Cause I.. 
- I'm not into that, either. 
I'm gonna wrap this up right now. 
and if you two refuse to check your scrotums for hardened nodules, 
I certainly can't force you, can l? 
Look, I gotta go, all right? Bye + 
Dave, are you still there? 
Hello, Dave? 
Kevin! 
Kevin, that's not a real toilet! 
Sweetheart, he's pissing in the middle of the whole thing! 
Buddy, I gotta go. 
But Cynthia and I are willing to offer you a life-changing opportunity. 
Jason, you don't understand. 
My son is literally peeing right in the middle of the store. 
I gotta go. 
Go, go, go. 
Okay, but that's not a real toilet there. 
It looks like a real toilet to me. 
Yeah, it looks real. 
Okay. 
That's a whole other conversation. 
You feel better? 
Yep. 
Okay, let's button those up. 
You want me to get those for you? 
Yep. 
There's not a lot to say. 
Sorry about that. 
Mom, Dad's home. 
Hi, hon. 
Hey, how was your day? 
Usual. 
Yours? 
Good. 
Okay, love you. 
Bye. 
Whoa, whoa, whoa! 
Wait a second, wait a second. 
You're going out? 
Yeah, I'm going out. 
What are... 
What are you wearing? 
Shorts. 
Shorts? 
That's... 
That's a Maxi Pad. 
Dad, they're designer shorts. 
They're French. 
Goodbye. 
Could you just come over here? 
Sit down for a second. 
I don't have time for this. 
Come here. 
Sit down. 
No, I'm... 
I'm late and they're waiting for me. 
I know, but you still live in my house for another few months, okay? 
Now when you dress like that, you send signals. 
You know what kind of guy you attract like that? 
You attract the guy with the... 
With his pants around his ass at the mall. 
No, I don't! 
Yes, you do. 
Sweetheart, he is right. 
Lacey, I'm saying you're beautiful. 
You're smart. 
You're a good person. 
You just got accepted into Stanford. 
We're so proud of you. 
I'm just saying know your value, okay? 
And if a guy doesn't see that, he doesn't deserve you. 
No, and you don't want to be with those guys, honey. 
Okay, then I'll go change. 
Thank you. 
And could you change the pictures on your Facebook page? 
Dad. 
It's just' cause we love you. 
Love me less. 
I don't want any bikini pictures on the Internet! 
When you're living in my house, you're a Taliban! 
Okay? 
You keep your body a secret. 
Except you get to, you know, go to school and read books. 
Did you send the tuition check? 
You said you were going to. 
Please. 
Don't start this again. 
Yeah, I didn't start with it. 
You just brought it up. 
You're supposed to send the check. 
You said you were gonna do it. 
You never do anything you say you're gonna do. 
Eighteen years. 
Just try to hold it together for another couple months. 
Trust me, I'm counting the days. 
Do that hurt, Daddy, or do that feel good? 
It's both. 
It hurt and it feel good. 
Bang, bang. 
Did you put in the wide beauty shots? 
Yeah. 
Are you sure? 
Why would you ask me that? 
You know I triple-check everything. 
Yeah, no, I know. 
It's just, you know, super-important, okay? 
We only get one shot at it. 
It'd just be nice if you could show me a little bit of trust. 
I do. 
Come on, I do, I do. 
I just want this to be perfect, that's all. 
It's not about trust. 
Come on. 
I want it to be perfect, too. 
Good. 
How old is she? 
I think she's 20. 
He met her at the mall. 
She was working at Foot Locker. 
He was so in love with Jennifer. 
I am shocked he met someone so quickly. 
I know. 
I was hoping they were just taking a break. 
I haven't even heard from her since they split up. 
I think he got us in the divorce. 
You want more wine? 
Cynthia, it's time. 
We're all set up in the bedroom. 
Great. 
Ladies? 
You're kidding, right? 
No, it's easy. 
We brought our own screen. 
You can't do it right now. 
We're in the middle of my son's birthday party. 
It won't take long and I know you" re gonna be really excited. 
Bring your booze. 
Okay, then. 
We're taking the wine. 
Watch this, guys. 
Watch. 
This is a really spooky ball. 
Just, could you please put the ball cancer video on? 
I'm trying, Joey. 
Please. 
I don't want to watch that ball cancer video. 
Where's Trudy? 
Oh, she's watching the magician. 
Well, there it is. 
Okay. 
This is not a video and it is not about ball cancer. 
Thank God. 
That, s a first. 
Jason and I are seriously considering getting a divorce. 
Okay? 
So, it's no secret that Cynthia and I have had our problems trying to conceive over the last 12 months. 
That's no reason to get a divorce. 
No. 
We know. 
Of course not. 
But suffice it to say, it's been more than taxing on both of us, 
and it's forced us to question our entire relationship. 
You two are perfect for each other. 
We're just not so sure about that anymore. 
We're not in a good place. 
Now, this is not a decision that we're taking lightly. 
Cynthia and I have been together for eight long years. 
And if it's not meant to be, we just don't want to waste any more of each other's time. 
Yeah. 
Because, if we do get divorced, it will take at least six months to go through the five stages of grief. 
For the sake of argument, let's optimistically assume it takes six months to find compatible mates. 
Tack on another 12 months for courtship, an additional six months for attempting procreation... 
You can see how this starts to stack up. 
Sounds like you guys are really working from the heart on this one. 
Well, we're lost, Dave, and so what we need to do is we need to take the next two weeks and we need to find out whether we're gonna push forward, or whether we're gonna fold up shop. 
And that is why we are going to go here. 
You're on, Cyn. 
Welcome to Eden. Okay? 
The ultimate playground for couples. 
It's got fun, it's got sun. 
It's Disneyland for adults. 
Wow. 
That is amazing. 
Yeah, you guys are gonna have a blast. 
Actually, we have found a great group rate. 
Oh, there's the fine print. 
No, now... 
Now, Joey, you know, just... 
The embarrassing fact is that, you know, 
Cynthia and I can't afford to go to this place by ourselves, but if all of us go together, it's half-price. 
It's called the Pelican Package. 
Okay? 
It's six nights, seven days and it's all inclusive. 
And there are quite a few activities you can choose from. 
Who here likes to eat? 
I know you guys do. 
I sure do. 
Right? 
Boom! 
Why not do it at a four-star restaurant? 
You guys, it has a state-of-the-art spa. 
Ah. 
Mmm-hmm. 
They've got your kayaking, they've got your windsurfing, they've got your canoeing, they've got your jet skiing. 
Wow. 
It's got Couples Skill Building and snorkeling... 
Who, whoa, whoa. 
Back up. 
What was that last thing? 
Snorkeling? 
Before snorkeling and after jet skiing, you said," Couples Skill Building." 
That sounds like therapy to me. 
See, that's gonna be a problem. 
We don't believe in therapy. 
No. 
Hell to the no. 
Then you don't have to do it. 
That's the great thing about the Pelican Package, you guys. 
It really includes everything. 
Obviously, Jason and I want to partake in the Couples Skill Building, but you guys can just do the fun stuff. 
So what are we asking? 
We're asking for you guys to fly to paradise and have an awesome time, okay? 
I mean, this... 
Come on, it would be a blast. 
Jason, I got a job, and with everything that's going on with the house and with the kids right now, it would be impossible for us to leave them. 
Yeah, we can't. 
When was the last time you two took a vacation? Hmm? 
I mean, don't you want to go to this island and have fun, together, as a couple? 
What kind of question is that? 
That's like asking Richard Simmons, would he rather stuff his face or skip around to the oldies. 
Of course he'd rather stuff his face, but he can't,'cause he's... 
He's got to stay thin so he can... 
So he can get up and do his thing and... 
And make videos. 
Maybe he needs the money. 
Maybe he's got a gambling problem! 
I don't know what goes on in that dude's head! 
And I'd love to go to that island, but I can't, either. 
Not' cause I got to make videos like Rich, but I got other obligations. 
Listen, I can really appreciate the situation that you guys are in. 
Right, well, we need to know by midnight. 
We've been on the wait list forever and these slots just opened up. 
We'd need to leave next week. 
Next week? 
That's right. 
What happened to spontaneity? 
What happened to fun? 
Why don't we have a PowerPoint presentation on spontaneity and fun and figure that one out? 
Look, Cynthia and I need this trip, okay? 
I mean, really. 
You know, the problem is, you know, we've stopped having fun and we're not even sure we know how to anymore, okay? 
So, what we need to find out is can we get back to the place where we really enjoy each other, you know? 
Can we get back to the place of, you know, being in love? 
Cynthia's IM-ing me. 
Jason was IM-ing me all night. 
What'd you tell him? 
I logged off. 
The place did look beautiful. 
You know what it made me think? 
It'd kind of be like we got to take our honeymoon, finally. 
God, yeah. 
That'd be great. 
Really? 
Yeah. 
Don't you think? 
I mean, I don't know, maybe it's a girl thing. 
When you're a little girl, you dream about your wedding and your honeymoon... 
You know. 
I was pretty lucky to get that job right away. 
Yeah, of course. 
I mean, I can't even imagine... 
Living in your dad's basement any longer? 
No. 
It's funny how time goes so fast. 
That doesn't seem that long ago. 
No. 
Seems like we just had so much going on and we have ever since, 
but maybe the thing to do is just really buckle down over these next six months and then when we come up for air, we'll go somewhere. 
That sounds like a plan. 
Dave? 
Did you hear that? 
Go back to bed, honey. 
What's going on? 
I think there's someone outside. 
Okay, I'll check it out. 
Honey, be careful. 
Freeze! 
Do not move! 
Hey, don't... 
No, it's me, it's me, it's me! 
It's me! 
It's Jason! 
What's going on? 
It's fine, honey, it's Jason. 
Hello! 
Why didn't you call? 
Didn't want to wake you up. 
Sorry, blew that. 
Back to bed. 
Are you crazy? 
I could've blown your head off! 
What does that say about you, huh? 
Rapists don't gently toss pebbles at the window, Dave. 
Wait, can you let me figure it out, please? 
There's too much going on. 
Turn it off! 
It costs money every time this thing goes off. 
Hello? 
Yeah, everything's fine. 
I'm sorry. 
The password is" ass-tastic." That's right. 
" Ass-tastic." One word. 
" Ass-tastic."" Ass-tastic." It's... 
A-S-S-T-A-S-T-I-C. 
Okay? 
Ass-tastic. 
That's right, it's... 
Okay. 
Yeah. 
No, thank you. 
We're fine. 
I... 
Yes, thank you. 
Didn't want to go with the pet's name? 
What are you doing here, dude? 
What do you think I'm doing here? 
Jas, you're showing up to my house in the middle of the night. 
Dave. 
You're breaking and entering. 
You're on tilt. 
Yeah, I know, I'm losing my mind. 
This... 
The whole fertility doctor thing is just an absolute disaster. 
We don't communicate anymore. 
We're fighting all the time. 
We... 
The only time we have sex is, you know, when she's ovulating, and even then, it's cold. 
It's emotionless. 
It's... 
I don't know. 
Like an oil derrick. 
We used to be very, very spontaneous at that. 
Now, it's... 
I don, t know. 
Twice a week, tops. 
That's a lot. 
Is it? 
How often do you do it? 
It's different now,' cause we got the kids, so... 
So? 
Well, my son falls asleep in the bed with us. 
That shouldn't stop you. 
That's disgusting. 
I'm not saying he should tickle your balls. 
Just move him into his room when he falls asleep. 
I can really appreciate what you're going through, but, man, this couldn't come at a worse time. 
There's just no way that we can pull away from everything and go right now. 
I'm sorry, but there's just no way we can go on the trip. 
I'm just scared, you know. 
Just scared. 
You know, my whole life, everything I've known about it for the last eight years might be over, and, you know, I'm prepared to face that, you know, if it, s for the best. 
If, you know... 
If it's not there anymore, then, you know, 
I'll face it. 
I don't want to do that alone. 
And I know that Cynthia doesn't want to do that alone. 
You know, we'd just... 
We'd love to have our friends there. 
You know that if you go, everyone else will go. 
And I have never asked you for anything. 
But I am asking you for this, Dave. 
Daddy? 
Hey, guys, the alarm was just an accident. 
You can go back to bed. 
It's just Uncle Jason. 
Okay, guys. 
It's fine. 
Let me take you back to bed. 
We want you to go on your trip. 
We heard you talking at the party and you said you couldn't go because of us. 
We don't want you guys to get a divorce. 
What? 
What are you talking about, honey? 
We're not getting a divorce. 
But we just want you to be happy. 
Guys, we are happy. 
We're very happy, honey. 
Were you guys listening to Uncle Jason's slide show? 
Thank you, buddy. 
That's great. 
That was adult time. 
And why do you think they were listening, Jason? 
I'm sorry about that. 
We want you to go, so we called Grandpa to come take care of us. 
You called Grandpa? 
You called him tonight? 
It's a three-hour drive. 
Grandpa's coming to babysit us. 
Is Grandpa driving down here now? 
Yay! 
Grandpa Jim Jim's here! 
You know, this has gotten way out of hand. 
I'm sorry. 
I just... 
I wanted five minutes of your time. 
I'm so sorry. 
You got... 
You got kids, you got guns, you got grandpas that, you know... 
You got to explain infertility and divorce and all that, and so you got a lot of parenting to do tonight. 
I'm gonna go. 
I'm gonna let myself out right here. 
I will, however, take the fact that 
Grandpa Jim Jim's at the front door as a firm, tentative yes. 
Pack lots of shorts. 
It's really hot there. 
You're gonna sweat your bag off. 
Night-night, kids! 
Hi. 
Welcome. 
Thank you. 
This place is beautiful. 
Look. 
Hi, hello. 
Holy shit, this looks like a screen saver! 
Thanks. 
Seems like he might be kind of the guy. 
Come on, gang. 
Hi, we are the Smith party. 
Party of eight. 
Eight for Smith. 
Jason Smith? 
That's me. 
Welcome to Eden. 
My name is Sctanley. 
Spelled with a" C". 
I will be escorting you to the Eden West resort. 
Please, step aboard our shuttle. 
No need to take your bags. 
They will be waiting for you in your villas. 
Excuse me. Sorry. 
Is this the shuttle for the Eden resort? 
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's the shuttle. 
Raq, she's still a little buzzed from the flight. 
Man, totally. 
Me, too. 
I don't even know what I'm doing. 
Excuse me. 
What name are your reservations booked under? 
The San Diego Dance Academy. 
You ladies are actually travelling on this shuttle, to Eden East. Wow. 
Ah. 
Bummer. 
Bye. 
See you. 
Bye. 
Bye. 
Would you care to join your wife? 
Let's do it. 
Shall we? 
Are they going some place else? 
Eden East. 
It is an entirely different resort. 
It's beautiful. 
And the luggage is already in there, huh? 
Yeah. 
This is yours. 
Unbelievable. 
The 101. 
- Wow. 
And we can jump right out into this here? 
You can do whatever you like. 
Wow. 
Look at the water. 
Please. 
Thank you. 
Wow. 
Wow. 
I'm gonna check the bedroom. 
Okay, baby. 
Look at this, baby. 
Oh, my God. 
Look at this. 
Welcome to your villa. 
It keeps getting better, huh? 
It's like a little love hut. 
Wow. 
This is insane! 
Honey, they got fish that you can see here through the floor! 
Baby, they got a hole where you can see the fish! 
Yeah, they got fish in here, too, baby! 
Jason, this is dreamy. 
Baby, you can jump right in the ocean on this thing, and they got a hot tub on the deck! 
They got the ocean and they got the hot tub! 
You can dive in the ocean and you got a hot tub! 
Yeah, they got a hot tub in here, too! 
Oh, my God. 
Yo, I gotta take a picture of this. 
Did I tell you? 
Did I deliver? 
Oh, my God. 
She ain't never seen nothing like this. 
I roll like this! 
Shit, yeah! 
I'm glad you like, sir. 
I be rolling like this. 
So what goes on over there? 
I hear there's music. 
Is a party for single woman and men, sir. 
Yes. 
How do I get over there? 
No, you cannot. 
You can take the boat if you want, but not for you. 
Okay, when's the boat? 
Not for me. 
No, because you got married here, the west coast to Eden Resort so that's why you must keep here. 
I don't understand what you're saying. 
You sound like Chewbacca. 
Well, my instinct is to stay married to her, but what do you think I should do? 
I mean, do you get a good vibe from us or not-so-good vibe? 
I don't know, sir. 
What about this room, in particular? 
You've checked a lot of people into this room and checked a lot of people out. 
Do they usually leave happier or less happy? 
I really don't know, sir. 
How do I get over to the party? 
By boat or by taxi boat. 
Okay. 
I'd like to arrange a boat or a taxi boat. 
No, it's not possible for you. 
Must to stay here with your wife. 
Okay, so how do I... 
Fish! 
Hello. 
Where's the television? 
The main house. 
There's no TV in the room? 
No, not possible. 
But it's the playoffs. 
As an alternative to television, might I recommend a stroll to the hidden waterfall? 
Might you recommend putting honey in my ears and having me fall asleep on an anthill? 
It's the playoffs. 
Honey, the waterfall sounds amazing. 
A little romance. 
You'll find that the Eden program creates a palace of solitude, if you just give yourself over to it. 
How's the cell service here? 
Monsieur Marcel believes that technology is a distraction. 
Well, how about tipping, would that be a distraction? 
I'm kidding you. 
Tipping is not permitted, nor is money of any kind. 
Everything here in Eden is free. 
Really? 
We do, however, accept smiles. 
Did you guys hear what they have in the spa? 
With the snow? 
Did you know that they have a steam, a rain, and a snow room here? 
It's a new European spa. 
What's a wahoo? 
It's a fish. 
I don't eat fish. 
It's out of this world. 
They catch it right here. 
I used to work at Red Lobster, so I know what they do with them fish in the kitchen. 
But, baby, this is not like the Red Lobster. 
It's a four-star restaurant. 
It's still Mexicans cooking that shit and I know what they do to it! I don't give a shit! 
I'm one-twelfth Latina, and even if I wasn't, I'm 100 % human, so I don't appreciate comments like that. 
I don't make fun of tu la raza, so porfavor, please, don't make fun of mi la raza - 
Oh, I'm sorry, boo. 
I didn't mean no disrespect. 
Yo, I was with mad Mexicans before Shane, anyway. 
Good evening. 
I trust you're all settled in. 
Hey, my main man! 
Are you in the mood to accept some smiles? 
" Cause this spread is phenomenal. 
Why don't you join us for a drink? 
You want to pull up a chair? 
We'll order some shots. 
You might want to go easy on those. 
You have an early morning. 
Quite the contrary. 
I don't have an early morning,'cause I tell you what's gonna go down tonight. 
I am going to get just a little bit tipsy. 
And then I'm gonna go ahead and stuff my face on the Seafood Tower, and I plan on shutting it down in a big way. 
I, if everything goes well, will be in my room, passed out on my face, come lunch-ski. 
Well, I'm afraid that isn't going to be possible. 
I'm here to present you with your itinerary. 
Fantastic. 
You guys hear that? 
This is a hard copy thing, too. 
This is not like... 
This isn't like a piece of paper with an itinerary. 
No. 
This is like a book. 
Thanks. 
And the journey begins. 
Couples Skill Building at 6 : 00 a.m.? 
Yeah, see, I was planning on sleeping in, and then maybe hitting the jet skis. 
That is not part of your immediate program here at Eden West. 
But it was in the slide show. Uh-huh. 
That would be more appropriate at the Eden East. 
What's Eden East? 
The singles' resort. 
Singles" resort? 
Here at the Eden West, our focus is on renewing bonds and nurturing neglected partnerships. 
And what's your focus over there? 
Sex, mostly. 
Freeing inhibitions. 
I'm sure if we play our cards right we'll be having plenty of sex here on our side. 
Am I wrong, gang? 
I spent three years of therapy with Jennifer, talking about our feelings and our problems, trying to hold onto our marriage. 
The last thing I want to do is talk. 
Look, I think there's been a misunderstanding here. 
See, we signed up for the fun stuff, with the touchy-feely shit being optional. 
Thank you. 
I think it's called the Pelican Package. 
Yes, the Pelican Package, which is monsieur Marcel's signature course. 
Great. 
A healthy combination of couple-friendly activities, ample down time... 
That's the one. 
... sprinkled in with some Couples Skill Building courses, designed to reignite the dimming flames of even the most mismanaged relationships. 
Okay, see, these relationships are not mismanaged. 
Well, thank you, Dave. Yes. 
Yeah. 
I'm just saying we're here to have some fun, so we are excited about the couples' activities, as well as some down time. 
It's the flame-lighting thing that does not have us inspired. 
That's more suited for this particular couple here. 
I don't think you're quite understanding me. 
Monsieur Marcel's Pelican Package is not a fast-food restaurant wherein you pick what you want from a menu. 
Monsieur Marcel is the single most-recognized couples whisperer in the entire world. 
Couple whisperer? 
He has studied psychology, yoga, tai chi, 
The Art of War, and combined them to form this place, Eden. 
The Mecca for couples. 
Mmm. 
He has designed a program specifically for you. 
You either partake of the entire meal or have none of it. 
I think you're being a little extreme here, Mr. Belvedere. 
We have a very long waiting list. 
If there's been some kind of misunderstanding, 
I'd be happy to refund your money, and you can go on your way. 
We will, however, not be able to refund your airfare. 
No, it's just that we were excited about the sightseeing and the hiking and the jet skiing and the snorkeling. 
It's... 
Well, there are plenty of places that provide those activities. 
Perhaps this troupe might be more comfortable at a Sandals or a Club Med. 
This here is monsieur Marcel's Eden. 
Now, if you're not at Couples Skill Building by 6 : 00 a.m., 
I'll take that as you want your refund and will not be completing the program. 
Screw him! 
Where does he get the ass to run down Sandals? 
Sandals rocks. 
It's just one little thing we have to do. 
It'll be over in a few hours and then we have fun the rest of the day. 
You know, let's just not forget why we came. 
This is not what we signed up for! 
This is not what we signed up for. 
I don't remember ever seeing' mandatory," 
but, listen, we just go with it. 
Now we're on Han's Island about to do the thing with Bruce Lee. 
Guys, guys, I don't think there's any reason to overreact right off the bat, okay? 
Obviously, the meal is included, from what he said, so let's just sit here, we'll weigh the pros and cons from a calm place, we'll make a decision. 
That was amazing. 
Oh, might have been the best meal I've ever had. 
Well, could be a full week of those. 
What are you doing? 
Your last course. 
Dessert. 
It is so beautiful here. 
I can't wait to go see that waterfall. 
The weather is perfect, we got huts on the water, and now I am eating art. 
So we give up a little bit of our day to talk about feelings. 
How bad can it really be, right? 
Welcome to Eden Resort. 
I am Marcel. 
Hi. 
Morning. 
I know why you are all here. 
You are here to seek the answer to the most commonly asked question by all, 
how do we make it work? 
How? 
I have laid out a personalized program designed to challenge you all, both as couples and as individuals. 
If you follow diligently my program, the answer to this question will be revealed to you, as well as your inner animal spirit. 
This I promise. 
I do not, however, promise that you and your chosen partner will have what it takes to sustain it. 
Please, line up on the beach. 
Take your places. 
Out here? 
This way. 
Men on one line, facing the ocean. 
Women, back to the water. 
Now remove your mask. 
Undress! 
Oh. 
All right. 
It's a freeing exercise. 
This is starting to get a little creepy now. 
It'd mean a lot to me if you" d just take your pants off, all right, Dave? 
Is that why you brought me here? 
This is... 
What is this? 
You must undress, my friend. 
I'm afraid that's not a option for me today, you know, man. 
It's the program. 
Right. 
I don't have any drawers, though. 
Well, Sctanley said he had this conversation with you last night. 
Now, if you've chosen to stay, you've chosen to participate. 
Now, if you're not wearing any drawers, then, hey, that was meant to be. 
Let it all hang out. 
Explore. 
Explore with your eyes. 
Explore your mate. 
We are all made in God's image. 
That means we are all perfect. 
Stand with pride. 
Look closer. 
Own your bodies. 
And now, tell your partner a truth. 
A beautiful truth. 
You look like the earth. 
What? 
Why are you listening to what I'm saying? 
Why don't you have your own conversation? 
It's hard to have my own conversation when you're telling Cynthia that she looks like the earth. 
Did you hear what I said? 
Yeah. 
I'm not really sure I like that one. 
Well, I just mean that, you know, you look bountiful. 
Okay? 
Fruitful. 
Fertile. 
Okay. 
Now this is getting uncomfortable. 
Please, make a palace of solitude between you and your partner. 
Why are you wearing trousers? 
I explained to the guy in the dress that I didn't have any drawers on. 
Yes, but this exercise is about owning your body. 
Mmm. 
What is your name, dear? 
Trudy. 
Trudy. 
What a beautiful name. 
Please, tell him that you love his body. 
For real? 
Yes. 
I love your body. 
Really? 
Of course! 
So powerful, so strong. 
Powerful frame with layer upon layer of dormant, relaxed muscle, waiting, like a panther, to pounce on its quivering prey. 
Please, take off his pants. Yes. 
I'm not ready to pounce today. 
Yes. 
I don't have any drawers. No. 
No. 
Right here, baby. 
It's okay. 
It's okay. 
Hair! 
Sorry, I'm sorry. 
Careful. 
Here it comes. 
Here it comes. 
Wonderful! 
Stare at it! 
Stare at all of it. 
Is his junk out? 
Yep. 
Is his junk literally out of his pants? 
Yep. 
Now it's a party. 
How would you describe your relationship? 
Average. 
Great, yeah. 
Great. Average. 
I mean, yeah. 
And, to clarify, what is an" average, great" relationship? 
Well, we... 
We make it through things pretty good together. 
You know, we have two great kids. 
No one's called 911 in the middle of the night. 
Like there's not domestic violence in the... 
The... 
Yeah. 
Ronnie, when you say you' make it through things together," 
what do you mean? 
Well, you know, the usual stuff. 
Work, kids. 
I'm much less interested in" the usual stuff" 
and much more interested in your particular stuff. 
So, what do you make it through together, specifically? 
Well, right now, specifically, 
Dave is dealing with his new launch of his video game, Guitar Hero. 
He sells Guitar Hero. 
And I am dealing with the renovations. 
That's interesting. 
What's interesting? 
Why do you keep writing stuff down on your little pad there? 
Oh, I'm taking notes. 
Would it make you more comfortable if I didn't take notes? 
Yeah, actually, it would make me more comfortable. 
Thank you. 
That's interesting. 
So we want to make the most of our time here on the island, so what we did was we put together a little informational packet to bring you up to speed on our relationship. 
Go ahead. 
That's for you. 
It just contains pertinent medical data, family histories, you know, stuff like that. 
Everything but a mix tape. 
How would you characterize your marriage? 
Perfect. 
Fantastic. 
Well, let's start with something easy, then. 
What's your favorite thing about your partner? 
Uh... 
She's a good mom. 
He really is a great dad. 
And where did you meet? 
School. 
High school. 
High school. Yeah. 
She was a cheerleader 
- I was on the football team. 
Fullback. 
I coach now, but I used to play. 
And we had... 
We actually had our daughter... 
We... 
On prom night, we conceived Lacey and it was a little confusing at the time, but it's been a blessing. 
It's been the best thing that's ever happened to us. 
It's been the best thing that ever happened to us. 
We did the right thing. 
How often do you have sex? 
She wants me to be tougher, screw harder. 
Work less, but bring home more. 
I can't keep this shit straight. 
All I know is, whatever I do, it's not good enough. Mmm. 
It's over. 
Then why are you here? 
This is not my wife. 
This is Trudy. I met her a couple weeks ago. 
Can we go boogie boarding now? 
And once people knew what we were going through, 
I think my cortisol levels just shot up through the roof. 
Because it's difficult to go through a very private struggle publicly. 
I heard what you think, but you know what I'm really interested in is hearing about how you feel. 
Just tell her how you feel. 
Well, I think if you looked at everything that... 
No, no, no, no. 
Just... 
Don't explain intellectually how you feel. 
You know, just tell her how you feel. 
In one word. 
Sure. 
Angry. 
Cynthia? 
Judged. 
Very good. 
Yes? 
Progress. 
Excited. 
Relieved. 
That is it. 
Yeah. 
We're awesome at feelings! 
Okay. 
Nice job today, guys. 
That's all for today? 
Great job. 
That's all for today. 
All right, well, great. Yeah. 
How did we do? 
Did we do good? 
I mean, are we gonna make it? 
Well, you know, it's just our first session, you know. 
We're not looking for an end result here. 
It's not a competition. 
I get all that, but have you seen couples that are worse off than us? 
Yeah. 
Or are we that far gone? 
We're... 
Are you gonna put a... 
Like a numerical value on it? 
You know, Doc? 
Like a one to 10? 
One being worst, 10 being best? 
No, hang on one second. 
Where would you put us? 
Right where you are, sir. 
What if someone put a gun to your head right now and said, 
" You have to answer this second or I'll shoot. 
" Are they gonna make it?" What do you say? 
What would you say? 
Whoa! 
Okay, no one has a gun to my head, Mr. Smith. 
It's hypothetical. 
It's not a place for inappropriate behavior. 
And you definitely don't pull a hypothetical gun on your therapist. 
Sorry. 
It's okay. 
Let's clear the karma. 
Okay? 
I'll holster this. 
See, you know, I work 10 hours a day, so by the time I come home, I'm exhausted. 
It's not that I don't want to answer questions about the house renovation. 
I really just don't want to answer questions about anything. 
But, you know, you may just be shutting your mind off, but it can feel like you're shutting your partner off as well. 
Again, that's a caution area. 
And just as a point of interest, when you speak that way, David, you're really de-prioritizing your teammate. 
Excuse me? 
It's called" crossing emotional boundaries." 
Or, more commonly," bulldozing." And it's ugly. 
Ronnie, when you spoke earlier of... 
Let me just find it in my notes here. 
There it is + You said," We make it through things well together." 
That doesn't sound very fun. 
You don't want to look back and say," I made it through my life." 
We want to enjoy our projects, enjoy our work week. 
We want to enjoy our lives, celebrate our lives. 
And all this talk about my project and his work, and my this and his that, and mine and his, and mine and... 
It, s... 
Where's us in all that? 
Where is our journey? 
I don't hear it. 
And it's because it's not there. 
Listen. 
I'm not saying that there's not some really stressful times sometimes, because there is, but it works for us. 
Does it? 
I don't know. 
Oh, gosh, I don't know, you guys. 
There's no" us." There's no" we." 
You two could be perfect strangers. 
I think the one thing that we can agree on, today, is that you guys should be doing a lot better than just" works." 
Pretty sure that's why you're here. 
Oh. 
That's it. 
Great. 
Great job, everybody. 
Thank you. 
Lucy? 
Good day, sir. 
I got room service for you. 
I'm very sorry. 
I didn't order that. 
I think your wife, she called me for you. 
I'm... 
This is just... 
Because I got a sunburn,'cause it was... 
The sun was very strong today. 
Yeah. 
I know. 
This is good for sunburns, right? 
No. 
Okay. 
It's good, yeah? 
It's good for sunburn? 
Okay, so I don't see anything. 
See what? 
There's nothing to see. 
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no. 
It works great. 
Okay, I move now. No. 
That was. 
- That was... 
There's nothing to move. 
I... 
I was... 
I had a sunburn. 
Good night, sir. 
Now we will enjoy looking at the fish! 
See and take in with your eyes all the beauty the ocean has to offer! 
As these new things come at you, you may not have seen them before, but be open to them and find the beauty within. 
Hey, buddy. Yep. 
Thanks a lot for bringing me to Problem Island. 
What are we gonna do for an encore? 
Talk about all the people that we slept with before we were married and really stir shit up? 
What the hell are you talking about? 
The therapist is trying to create a problem in my marriage that doesn't exist! 
Maybe he's not creating them, maybe he's just noticing them. 
Okay, you know what? 
Don't start with me. 
I'm serious. 
These are the best in the world at what they do, all right? I don't need it. 
If Jeff Gordon told you that your oil was low, you might want to think about changing it. 
From the bucket, feed them! 
My therapist is kind of pushy. 
Really? Yeah. 
God, I like ours. 
Yeah, he said that Dave and I take each other for granted. 
That, you know, our relationship has become more like a job. 
How do you mean? 
For example, he says that Dave is de-prioritizing me, that he doesn't pay attention to what I actually want. 
Yeah, but, honey, that's just Dave being Dave, you know? 
Yeah. 
But so then, what if Dave being Dave is sort of like 
Dave bulldozing me? 
Please continue to look at the fish! 
Enjoy them as they come at you! 
I get it, dude, it's advanced snorkeling. 
Dave... 
Hey, I'm trying to do this exercise! 
Why don't we talk about this during down time, okay? 
This might be what the therapist is referring to. 
You're missing out on life. 
It's happening right now, out here, all around us, all right? 
And you're too busy complaining about your problems to enjoy all these beautiful little fish that are... 
Marcel! 
Yes? 
Marcel, we have a real problem here! 
It is not a problem! 
It is a circle of life! 
The circle of life is circling our lives right now! 
Do not move, do not panic. 
Shark! 
What? 
Shark! 
Jason! 
Okay, it's all happening, Marcel! 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God. 
Oh, my God. 
Don't worry! 
Wait! 
These are only lemon sharks! 
This is all part of the course. 
It is like life. 
Like in relationships. 
They will not attack unless they feel attacked! 
Marcel, I need you to take the French out of your mouth and tell me what to do! 
Don't let them see your fear. 
Okay, I think we just hold tight, we play it cool, we don't make a move. 
What was that? 
What? 
What was that? 
Jason, stop... 
He said not to panic! 
He said not to panic! 
I'm sitting in blood! 
I'm sitting in blood! 
Marcel, this isn't a drill, buddy! 
You got real sharks here! 
It's time to get the guns and it's time to shoot some fish! 
Here on Eden, there are no guns! 
You got an American life at stake. 
One life is not more important than another. 
What do I do? 
My friends and my wife left me to die. 
You must get out of the chum, but slowly. 
Okay. 
Swim slowly out of the chum! 
Slowly. 
Slowly. 
Yes, yes. 
Slowly, baby! 
Stop! 
I don't know what to do. 
I don't know if I'm standing still or I'm swimming. 
Swim now! 
Stop! 
They're torturing me! 
They're playing with me! 
They're slow-playing me! 
Shoot them! 
Swim slowly. 
Swim, swim, swim. 
Save yourselves! 
Go to shore! 
It's too late! 
They've got me! 
It's only a matter of time! 
There's no sharks around you, honey. 
You're safe now, baby. 
I don't know what's going through my mind! 
I'd love some ice cream. 
I'd love some ice cream, with maybe some pecans in it! What? 
Couples' massage is part of your program and so important. 
It gives you the chance to bond, relax, reconnect. 
We prefer to bond on our own. 
Okay, would you prefer male or female therapists? 
What would you recommend more for like a nurturing, pampering, motherly energy? 
Would that be a man or a woman, do you think? 
A woman. 
Well, I'm just so tight in my shoulders. 
Do you have any... 
Let me see. 
We do have a male masseur available, madam. 
Daddy, I can't wait to get my drink on tonight! 
Damn! 
Is this whole thing uphill? 
Where's the downhill part? 
We gonna get our groove on tonight. 
Right, Daddy? 
Of course, baby. You know how we do it. 
Well, hello. 
Hi. 
Lucy. 
Yes. 
Excellent. 
Who are you? 
I am Xavier and I will be your man-seur for today. 
Xavier? 
Yes. 
Mmm. 
Twenty, 30, 40, 50... 
Hi. 
Joey. 
Yes. 
What's your name? 
Gert. 
What a beautiful name. 
Well, thank you. 
Do you mind if I heat up the lotion? 
No. 
Heat that lotion up. 
The hotter the better. 
What kind of massage do you want? 
You left it blank. 
Korean? 
Korean? 
I am not familiar with Korean. 
Dealer's choice. 
Whatever releases the most tension. 
Mmm. 
Oh, that feels so good. 
Thank you. 
I can't tell you how much I need this. 
It has been a long time. 
Oh, I love pleasuring people. 
So do I. 
I mean, it's not my job, but it is a job that I love doing, if you know what I mean. 
I know exactly what you mean. 
So, Joey, do you have any problem areas? 
I hold a lot of tension in my upper thighs. 
We'll get to your upper thighs. 
It's just the top of my quads. 
As a matter of fact, if you want to do, like, the full 80 minutes on the thighs, I'm good. 
Whatever you want. 
Oh, I need this. You have no idea. 
Oh, you got great hands. 
Okay, Joey, what I want you to do for me is just close your eyes. 
Quiet that mind, okay? 
Just listen to my voice. 
Feel the sound slide down my throat and come out through my mouth. 
Down my throat, come out through my mouth. 
Down my throat... 
Keep... 
Keep going, keep going. 
Sir, I'm so sorry. 
No, no, no. 
Don't be sorry. 
You shouldn't be sorry. 
No, I aroused you. 
You should be proud. 
This hasn't happened to me in a long time. 
Are you attempting to have a manual stimulation from me, sir? 
Am I... 
I am here on a couples retreat with my wife in the other room. 
My husband Scott is just like a cat. 
Scott? 
My husband. 
I'm trying to save my marriage here. 
Look what you did to me. 
Well, that wasn't my intention, sir. 
It wasn't mine, either, and now I'm humiliated. 
Well, I'm sorry. 
You told me not to think. 
Well, when I don't think, this is what happens. 
You can't leave me all backed up like this. 
What do you want me to do, sir? 
I don't know. 
We got to figure out a solution. 
You know, let's not take anything off the table. 
Let's start brainstorming. 
We" re both in a maze together, okay? 
How do we get the cheese? 
I'm sorry, sir, but that is not gonna have a happy ending. 
Give me the oil. 
Go grab a smoke. 
Daddy, this is awesome! 
Yo, they should put me up in a video on this bitch! 
Don't go chasing waterfalls 
Stick me in the ocean I'm gonna make it look real good 
You go, girl. 
Daddy's got to ice his knee, baby, okay? 
If you just let me recharge my battery, 
I promise, this'll be more for you later, okay? 
Technically, I was bit by a shark. 
Were you bit or were you nipped? 
I mean, if you had been bit, you probably would have lost a great deal of blood and... 
What difference does it make to you two, anyway, what you would call it? 
It hurt. 
And I had shark teeth penetrate my skin. 
And besides, Jason, it's your fault that it happened. 
The only reason I got bit in the first place is because you did the worst thing you could possibly do in that situation. 
You panicked and you threw a bucket of chum in my face. 
I did the prudent thing and I got the hell out of the water. 
There were sharks in there, David. 
What was I supposed to do? 
You know what? 
Remember it however you want to and I'll remember it how it actually happened. 
Dave. 
I mean, really, did they penetrate your skin? 
Do you really need that bandage? 
Lucy, I don't know what to tell you, okay? 
You tell me if I need the bandage. 
It looks like you scraped yourself on the ladder, maybe, on the way out. 
I'm sorry? 
Did you get out of the water abruptly? 
Hey, I don't know how to explain it to you. 
Maybe I have tough skin. 
Perhaps lemon sharks don't leave that bad of a mark. 
Maybe they're pack animals and they're marking me for later. 
I don't know. 
Dave, I was in a car accident once, okay? 
And it was really scary, I had nightmares. 
But when... 
I've been in a car accident, too. 
Have you ever been bit by a shark? 
I was never bit by a shark. 
I'm just saying that I understand. My... 
Say it again. I was in a car accident. 
No, say the last part. 
I was never bit by a shark. 
That's it! 
Then you shouldn't talk about it. 
And I'm not gonna sit here and try to explain myself to a bunch of black and white suburban trash who don't know a damn thing about the ocean. 
And you understand the ocean, honey? 
I have some real field experience, honey, yeah. 
I had a shark attack. 
I'm part of a very elite group. 
Like people who have been struck by lightning. 
Not everyone can say that they've had that and maybe that's what's going on here today. 
You know what? 
I don't want to get in an argument with it. 
I really don't. 
You know what? 
I'm really exhausted. 
It's been a long day. 
I'm gonna go back to the room. 
You want to come with me? 
Baby, I thought we were gonna go to the waterfall tonight and have a little alone time. 
Sweetheart, I'm a shark attack survivor. 
I'm fried. 
Honey, I think the fear was a lot worse than the actual attack, which I can totally appreciate, but the good news is you weren't hurt, so let's not ruin the evening over it. 
I'm sorry? 
Honey, you weren't hurt. 
Good night. 
Dave! 
Where you going? Dave. 
Come on, okay, you got bit by the shark. 
You got bit, I believe you! 
We're here all the time, so let's take that opportunity to go to bed. 
Honey, we'll go to the waterfall with you. 
We'll grab our drinks and go. 
Yeah. 
We could all go together. 
It'll be beautiful. 
Hon? 
I was thinking that maybe we might go back to the room, huh? 
Bolt the door, draw the shades, huh? 
Just shut the whole world out and sit Indian-style and really explore our feelings. 
Daddy! 
Wake up! 
It's too deep! 
Yo, you having a nightmare. 
You ain't even in the water. 
It's night time. 
Look, you said we was gonna have fun, so let's get up, let's dance, let's do a shot, let's do something. 
Anything. 
Baby, let's just go back to the room, all right? 
I don't want to go back to the room. 
I don't want to go to sleep. 
We're not going to sleep. 
We're not? 
Mmm-mmm. 
What we gonna do in there? 
For real? 
My husband found himself in a very traumatic shark situation. 
Here we go. 
As we were planning to go to the waterfall and have a romantic evening, because, as you know, we don't do that very often because of the kids and work... 
But somehow, this crazy, traumatic shark experience was enough to make him neglect his wife. 
Ronnie, nice to meet you. 
Well said. 
David, how did that make you feel? 
I know my truth. 
Excuse me? 
I know my truth. 
Did you say," l know my truth',? 
Oh, boy. 
Listen, I'm telling you, you getting on my last nerve! 
Yo, I didn't sign up for this! 
Yo, you said we was gonna be dancing. 
You said we was gonna be partying. 
You said we was gonna be doing what we do. 
You made promises, Daddy. 
Boo-Boo, look, they got me doing a lot of activities. 
What do you expect from me? 
I'm tired. 
You tired? 
Yo, I'm tired. 
Plain and simple, I ain't having it. 
Sometimes we forget how to do the easiest thing in the world, which is just to talk to each other. 
Okay, let's start here. 
Lucy, you go first. 
I want you to look at Joey and say hi. 
And Joey, after you've heard that, 
I want you to look back at Lucy and say hello in return. 
And then we'll just see where it goes from there, okay? 
Hi. 
Hello. 
You kept saying" open" and" fruitful" and other weird stuff. 
That's not feeling, it's just more talking in short half-sentences, and you managed to turn feeling into a job or an activity, and it was exhausting. 
So now it's my fault that you don't feel satisfied! 
Everything is my fault? 
Is that what you're saying? 
I'm not saying that! 
I'm crazy? 
You don't look at me! 
You don't ever ask me how I am! 
I work! 
You haven't looked at me in 10 years! 
I'm crazy and everything is my fault, and my family is awful, and nothing at all is your fault! 
'Cause you rock, Joey! 
If a guy talked to me like that, I'd punch him in the face. 
You're such an asshole! 
You're an asshole! 
It's like a little kid who gets a puppy for the first time, just hugs it so much, snaps its neck. 
Cynthia's your puppy. 
It's puppy-cradle death syndrome. 
All that love is gonna snap that puppy. 
Yeah, but... 
You don't want that! 
The dawning of a new day. 
A marriage is not a timeless agreement. 
It is one day. 
And each day, it begins anew. 
Moments. 
Life is made of them, much the same as a great mosaic. 
A thousand little pieces that make one great image. 
But the most important thing in life is... 
And today, we open the door to breath with a shared yoga group experience. 
Our instructor, Salvadore, is running late. 
So I will touch on tomorrow. 
It is very important that you are here before sunrise, as well as not eat or drink anything too late tonight. 
As you pursue knowledge, as well as your own individual animal spirits, it is very important that you strictly follow your programs. 
Failure to do so will definitely take you off your path and lead you away from the answers you seek. 
I'm sorry, monsieur Marcel. 
Why is it so important for us to be on time tomorrow when Pablo, the yoga guy, is running late today? 
Quiet, please. 
The yoga teacher's punctuality is not your concern. 
You are to be here before sunrise. 
Why is it so important for us to be here on time tomorrow? 
I'm not understanding. 
Why can't we eat or drink tomorrow? 
What, is he gonna probe us? 
Who is that? 
Oh, my. 
Damn! 
I guess that's the yoga guy. 
This just gets better and better. 
Well, hello. 
I am so sorry I'm late. 
I just swam from the other side of the island. 
Please, allow me to put on something more proper before we can begin. 
Thank God. 
There we go. 
Much better. 
Now, who is ready for their yoga? 
My name's Jason. 
Jason. 
Pleasure, hi. 
Nice. 
Cynthia. 
Hi. 
Can't wait. 
Hello, Cynthia. 
Yes, we have a brave peacock. Use that. 
Yes. 
Yes. 
Hi, you must be Veronica. Hi. 
Yeah, how did you know? 
Why, I have read that you have studied the yoga for five years. 
Oh, well, I mean, just off and on, you know, before the kids came. 
Nonsense. 
You know, there is such thing called the muscle memory? 
And I could tell by looking at your gait, your muscles remember. 
Thank you. Yes. 
Okay, we are going to do the children's position. 
What's that? 
Head down, buttocks up. 
Everybody on your mats. 
Yeah, that's good. 
That's good. 
Very nice posture. Yes. 
Encouragement. 
So I will transfer you my energy. 
I will transfer my karma. 
Here is my karma on you. 
Jason! 
You have a great aura. 
Yes. 
Jason! 
Encouragement! 
Yes! 
This is a great way to stretch. 
Yep. You see? 
You could do this with your partner at home. 
Sure. 
Let's ride this energy out! 
Keep your chin up. Yep. 
Yes, this fire has just started. 
And we will not put it out. 
What is he doing? 
I don't really know that pose. 
Okay, now we go into the happy baby pose. 
No, no, no, no, no, no. 
Please regard me. 
I'm sorry? 
Please, allow me. 
To do what? 
Regard me. 
Okay. 
Yes. 
Okay. 
You are doing fantastic, my dear. 
Thank you. 
Okay. 
See as I gently pulsate. 
Okay... 
Trying to go deeper and deeper, and bring her deeper and deeper into a stretch, yes? 
Okay, Fabio, that's enough of the pulsating. 
Please. 
Then do it! Yes! 
Encouragement, my friend. 
Yes, fantastic progress. 
Yes, put your shoulders back. 
Yes. 
Now feel the energy. 
Feel that energy. Yes. 
Through your chest. 
Your peacock chest. Yes. 
Good! 
You like that? 
Yes. 
Good job. 
Encouragement. 
Yes. Great job. 
There, you need to find your mental equilibrity. 
Not on my knees, man, that hurts. 
It's okay, it's okay. 
Know your limits, yes? 
There is no giving up in yoga, you know? 
Encouragement, yes! 
Encouragement my ass, Daddy! 
You ain't even trying! 
Look, yoga's not my strong suit. 
Yoga's not your strong suit? 
Oh, look at this one. 
This little one is flexible. 
She's good. She's really good. 
Ooh, fantastic. 
So you do like the lizard. 
Now is when we transfer the energy, you see? 
Yep. 
And you just lay everything on top of her? 
Yes. 
Lay it on. 
Stretch. 
That feels pretty good, hon? 
What? 
Am I straight enough here, do you think? 
Or am I curving a little? 
Let me show you. 
You feel the transfer of the energy. 
Well, it feels solid. 
It is tantric energy. 
Yeah. 
It is karma. 
Yes. 
Okay, now I want all my girls in a downward dog position. 
Yes, this pose contains a tantric hip thrust. 
Now you and I will try this. 
You got a pose called" Yoga Guy Gets His Ass Kicked',? 
" Cause that's my favorite one. 
I feel your anger, yes! 
Yes, I got your blood pumping, yes? 
No? 
Now use it! 
Harness it! 
Hmm. 
Boom! 
Everybody into the children's pose! 
Heads down. 
Okay. 
Close your eyes. Yes? 
Yes, good. 
Let's breathe. 
Excuse me, Salvadore? 
I feel like my sacrum is really tight. 
Could you just help me stretch it out a little? 
Yes, of course, I will play the role of your husband. 
Great. 
Boom, boom. 
Boom. 
The rain room has fire. 
I did not see that coming. 
I was getting centered. 
I was enjoying the island. 
What if Joey had seen? 
Lucy, it was really inappropriate. 
Well, I didn't know that you were so concerned about how Joey felt. 
What's that supposed to mean? 
Let's drop it. 
All I'm saying is that it was pretty uncomfortable. 
Well, then why were you staring? 
It was hard to miss. 
Trust me, Salvadore is the least of our problems. 
It's freezing in here. 
Why would they make a room like this? 
You should have seen my masseuse. She was so hot. 
You're supposed to be relaxing out here. 
Why do you think I wanted to get a full release? 
You know what? 
I don't even want to get into this with you. 
Into what? 
I don't want to get into this conversation with you. 
Why is that? 
Because I don't want to be put in a position where l, d have to lie. 
Why are you getting all high and mighty on me? 
No, I'm not so high and mighty. 
Joey, I'm not judging you, 
I'm just not asking anything because 
I don't want... 
I don't want to know. 
Because that way, if someone asks me... 
You won't have to rat me out. 
I would never rat you out. 
Of course I wouldn't't rat you out. 
Right, right. 
But this way, I don't have to make that decision because I really don't know. 
All right, let me ask you something, then. 
Could you honestly say that after seven years together, that you get turned on by the same woman? 
I do. 
Without going to the highlight reel. 
You're playing a verbal shell game. I... 
You have to make your own decisions. 
I'm just saying I don't want to know. 
I'm saying, if you're... 
When you're sleeping with her, if you're hitting up some fan favorites, 
I think you're cheating on some level. 
You might not be acting on it, but you're fantasizing. 
I don't know what journey you're on, but I... 
I can't take this trip with you. 
But if I told you, as a friend... 
I came up to you, I said," Hey, Dave, I'm attracted to men." 
I was thinking about their bodies and things, but I didn't act on it because I'm straight and I was being very strong, would you consider me straight or gay? 
If I desired a man. 
If I was thinking about a man's body, like how the light reflects off of his sweaty back... 
Am I interrupting something? 
No. 
We're great. 
Have a seat. 
Want to sit down? 
Enjoy this. 
Enjoy it. 
No, I'm good here. 
Thank you. 
If I was sleeping with my wife and thinking about, like, a dude's wet mouth... 
Snow and steam, huh? 
Is this place outstanding? 
Okay, Jason, let me ask you a question here. 
Is the highlight reel considered cheating? 
The highlight reel? 
No. 
I'm just saying everybody cheats and everybody lies, and whether they act upon it or not is a secondary conversation. 
So you're saying that you can't tell the difference between the highlight reel... 
I can tell the difference. 
... and physically, really cheating on somebody? 
Don't say it to me like I can't tell the difference. 
Well, that's what you're saying! 
You're saying that they, re related, then they're somehow in the same family. 
No, no. 
I'm saying you own a Jack Russell, I own a Bull Terrier. 
They're both dogs. 
They're both terriers. 
Mine's just a little more aggressive than yours. 
I own a zebra, you own a goat. 
What the hell's that have to do with cheating on your wife? 
Right, they're both animals. 
Are you out of your mind? 
How would you feel if your wife cheated? 
Guys? 
Listen to me. 
Trudy's gone. 
What? 
What do you mean? 
What? 
I went to the room and all her stuff was gone. 
Where do... 
Where do you think she went? Like she... 
I don't know. 
We had a argument at therapy. 
She said she was sick of my senior citizen bullshit. 
I've been trying to keep up with her, but I'm a old ass! 
Shane, honey, it's not your fault. 
No, it's bullshit. 
It is my fault. I should have worked harder. 
Now she's gone! 
She's not gone. 
I know where she is. 
Sit down. 
How do you know where she is? 
Now use your head. 
She's a young girl. 
She wants to party. 
She wants to get wild. 
Too late to leave the island. 
Where is she? 
Where's the only place she could go? 
Eden East, the singles' side. 
We gotta go get her. 
You're damn right we do! 
And I'm going with you! 
I am not letting you go alone! 
I don't care if I have to go there all night! 
To find Trudy. 
We're gonna go find Trudy for him! 
We can't even go to that side, all right? 
And it's gonna get very dark, very soon. 
Plus we have to be in bed... 
What are you talking about? 
Listen to me. 
We have to be to bed at a very reasonable hour tonight because we cannot miss the sunrise in the morning. 
Now, Marcel said if we miss that sunrise, we will not be completing our course. 
We are here for the course, all right? 
- Yes. 
And stop eating and drinking, as well. 
Honey, our friend is asking for our help. 
She's 20 years old, for God's sake. 
She's probably with a bunch of dudes, like, sweating, drinking and dancing it out of her system. 
What's the problem? 
Let her spend the night on Hump Island! 
I promise, she's gonna come back here first thing in the morning! 
Dave, firstly... 
I don't want her to spend a night on Hump Island. 
No, I... 
I'm just trying to say it's not like she's kidnapped or something. 
Now she's dead, Dave? Huh? 
Now she's dead? 
She's dead, now? 
She's not dead. 
She's dead on Hump Island! 
I'm just trying to put it in perspective for you! 
You know what? 
I don't even know why I'm blowing up at you, because it... It's... 
Once again, it's my fault. 
This is a Shane thing. 
I've been dealing with this all my life. 
First Jennifer, and now Trudy. 
We're gonna find her, okay? 
I got a plan. 
I know how to get there. 
You do? 
Yeah, I do. 
I just can't tell you now" cause we got Mr. Belvedere clocking us. 
Now everybody take it real casual. 
Just drink your drinks and smile. 
So we just make it all nice. 
Everything's easy, fun, we're drinking, we're smiling. 
Okay? 
We can't leave till sundown. 
Guys, we all need to be together first thing in the morning, okay? 
Which is exactly why we have to find Trudy. 
Otherwise, we won't all be there. 
Let's get out of here now. 
Reconvene later at the beach, at 1900 hours. 
You with me? 
Joey, we are not gonna be able to finish the program if we get caught! 
All right, bring it in. 
Hey, come on, Shane! 
We walk to the other side, we get caught. 
This way, we canoe out nice and easy, we find ourselves a nice, quiet beach. 
We pull up. 
We find the singles' side, we find a dance floor, we find some cocktails. 
And we find Trudy and we bring her back... 
Yeah, we find Trudy and we bring her right back here. 
This is crazy. 
Trust me. I was an Eagle Scout. 
My mind is a compass. 
I can handle these situations. 
I've been trained to do so. 
Now follow me and I'm gonna get you there, but we gotta do it quick and we gotta do it quiet. 
Come on. 
These are not the best laid plans, okay? 
I'm just gonna go on record right now, okay? 
I do not think this has a high chance... 
If we keep up this pace, we'll be there in 20 minutes! 
I hope so! 
What was that? 
Great! 
Awesome! 
What do we do? 
No! 
Jason! 
Cynthia! 
Cynthia! 
Grab the oar! 
Are you okay? 
You all right? 
Yeah. 
We gotta go to shore! 
Cynthia, we're out of synch again. 
You know, you gotta paddle on the opposite side of the boat! 
Well, Jason, I can't see which side you're paddling on! 
Well, turn around and take a look every once in a while. 
Otherwise, we are gonna capsize again. 
You get that, right? 
It was an accident. 
I'll bet it could have been avoided. 
Right? 
Am I right? 
Baby' I need you to paddle. 
Cynthia, paddle the boat, please! 
You know what? 
Sit down. 
You've got to sit down in the boat! 
Cynthia! 
Cynthia! 
Cynthia! 
What are you doing? 
Cynthia! 
Cynthia! 
Hey! 
Cynthia! 
Thank God. 
Thank God that is over! 
I mean, who jumps out of the canoe? 
You could have really hurt yourself out there! 
Put these on. 
Cynthia? 
Jason, I have had it! 
I can't do everything exactly the way you want! 
I can't control the ocean and row the boat and stop the waves! 
Calm down! 
And I can't do anything about the fact that I can't get pregnant! 
This is nuts. 
No, it's me. 
And I just really need some time right now. 
Please stop following me,' cause I need to be away from you. 
Come on. 
What are you doing? 
Hey, hey, where you going? 
That's a jungle! 
You know what? 
I'm gonna go check on her, okay? 
Great, thank you. 
Yeah, you guys go ahead. 
I'm gonna make sure she's okay. 
Honey, I don't think it's a good idea that everyone separates right now. 
I really don't think we have a choice. 
Let me just go talk to her. 
No, Jason, she really needs a minute, okay? 
All right, go ahead. 
I gotta go. 
Baby! 
You guys go ahead! 
We'll meet you guys there! 
So, what are we gonna do about Trudy? 
What are we gonna do about Cynthia, who just disappeared into the jungle? 
Jason, she's upset. 
Let her cool down. 
You'll talk to her later. 
We still gotta get Trudy to do all the Marcel stuff, anyway, all right? 
So let's just get her ass and let's get back home. 
Cyn, please, slow down, honey. 
I think we're almost there. 
I think we might have taken a wrong turn. 
Really? Yeah. 
Wow. 
Finally made it to the waterfall. 
I'm so tired of him trying to steer everything in the direction that he thinks is right all the time. I think my marriage is over. 
What? 
Honey, don't say that. 
You're just exhausted. 
I am. 
Listen. 
Don't make any decisions right now. 
You guys just need to take a breather. 
Get a little bit of space, you know? 
You'll be okay. 
You know? 
You guys have been on top of each other ever since we got here. 
No, that's the... 
Actually, the one thing that we haven't done. 
We haven't had sex since we've been here. 
We've barely even touched each other. 
Now, Cynthia and I are in a terrible spot. 
I come to this island, I come to the program to get some answers, find out my animal spirit... 
Yeah. 
Let me help you out on the whole animal spirit thing. 
It's gonna be awesome! 
It always is. 
It's like if you go to a tarot card reader for past lives, you're always something cool... 
Dave like a king or a gunfighter. 
No one ever finds out that they were, like, a shopkeeper or an asshole. 
Is this hilarious to you? 
'Cause it's not to me. 
Tell you what + If I get kicked off this island, I'm gonna blame all of you. 
And I can't believe I let the two of you derail me! 
We derailed you? 
That's correct. 
If you kept a closer eye on Trudy, she wouldn't have strayed so far from the pack, all right? 
She's not a dog, Jason. 
Yeah? 
Well, listen, she's been very selfish, hasn't been a very good teammate. 
I can tell you that. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
Look, I made promises, I let her down. 
You don't know the ins and outs of our relationship. 
Is that what it is? 
It's a relationship? 
It's been two weeks, okay? 
All right? 
That's not a relationship. 
It's more like an antibiotic cycle, all right? 
She should be very happy that she's even here. 
You're a good guy. 
You brought her to this island. 
She shouldn't be running off. 
She should be doing everything that she can, bending over backwards to make you happy. 
Don't blame this on Shane. 
You brought this on yourself. 
I don't need to hear it from you, okay? 
It's half your fault. 
Half his fault, half Trudy's fault, half your fault. 
Me? 
Yeah, with the whole canoe scheme? 
All right? You put me and my wife in a very extreme situation, put tension on the relationship. 
Your wife left you because you were suffocating her. 
And now you're suffocating me! 
And you're suffocating Shane, too! 
Yeah, don't suffocate me, man. 
A grown woman literally jumped into shark-infested waters and did a distance swim that she had no way to train for instead of staying in a dry canoe with you. 
Look in the mirror. 
Okay, Joseph Cecil Tanzini, with a monsoon of respect, I don't think you're in a position to be telling anyone to look in the mirror when it comes to relationships. 
You're not Mr."' I Try So Hard At My Relationship," okay? 
So let's go, glass house. 
Me, glass house? 
You, glass house! 
You're the glass house! 
Talk to me about relationships. 
You got a woman who adores you. 
She'd do anything for you. 
You have a real partner in life, and what does she want from you? 
" Take me to the waterfall." But, no, you can't take her because you had some over-stimulated snorkeling experience. 
Do you think when your marriage is over that you're gonna find somebody that just caters to you, no matter what? 
That you're not gonna have to work at it? 
That's gonna be, like, psyched to go to Applebee's with you every Friday night and hear the same football stories about how you rocked in high school? 
I did rock in high school football. 
You want to check tape? 
But whoever that person is, you have to listen to their stories, too, or they're not gonna go to Applebee's with you. 
You're not gonna have someone to go to Applebee's with. 
You'll be sitting by yourself, eventually, at Applebee's, all alone. 
And who wants to go to Applebee's by themselves? 
If anyone should be mad here, guys, it should be me. You know what? 
I am having a real fight with my wife, okay? 
And it's not a fun feeling. 
Look it. 
I'm talking in circles. 
I'm on an island. 
I'm getting island fever now. 
I'm starting to lose my mind. 
This is an early sign of things to come. 
And what we need to do now is get focused and stop pointing fingers. 
You're a problem. 
You're a real, real problem. 
Is that Salvadore? 
Does this guy think he's a mermaid? 
What is his deal? 
Oh. Please, excuse my nudity. 
I was expecting no company. 
Allow me to put something on. 
I would have asked you to join me, but the water is a little chilly. 
But perhaps this will warm up the evening. 
And what is that? 
It's an island rum, infused with the essence of the coconut fruit. 
Delicious. 
Yes? 
You like? 
Very much. 
Yes. 
That's yummy. 
It is yummy. 
It's yummy, yummy, yummy, isn't it? 
Mmm. 
Yes. 
Oh, oh... 
Slow down there, killer. 
You see, this island has so many healing curiosities. 
You know, it is good to have a drink and have a good time. 
Then do it! 
Well, I guess we just go around, huh? 
No, we gotta go through. 
The path ends. 
We go off the path, we get lost + Come on. 
No, hey, we'll make a new path. 
What if there's people in there? 
Joey! 
Be careful, sweetie. 
Ronnie, I'm Cynthia. 
I'm always careful! 
Yes! 
Okay. 
Okay. 
Get in there. 
You, re leaving fingerprints! 
I don't know what you're doing... 
Get away from the door. 
Jessie is a friend 
Yeah, I know he's been A good friend of mine 
But lately something's changed That ain't hard to define 
Jessie's got himself a girl And I want to make her mine 
And she's watching him with those eyes 
And she's loving him with that body I just know it 
And he's holding her in his arms late Late at night 
You know,.. 
Hey! 
What are you doing here? 
Private staff quarters are strictly off limits to hotel guests! 
I'm so sorry that we are disturbing your fortress of solitude here. 
I'm going to have to ask you to leave The Ponderosa immediately. 
Well, that's a shame, because the place is so inviting. 
When does Hoss and Little Joe show up? 
Dave. 
You gentlemen have broken into The Ponderosa and have broken the rules of this island. 
And, unfortunately, I don't think you're gonna like the consequences. 
I'm gonna call monsieur Marcel. 
No, no, no, no, no, no. 
Sctanley, there's been a big misunderstanding. 
Some of us don't necessarily want to be here. 
I'm sorry, Mr. Smith, but you've broken the rules and there are consequences. 
Yes, could you get Marcel for me, please? 
Yes, I know he's asleep, but wake him. 
This is important. I'll hold. 
What a shocker that this went bad. 
Thank you. 
Came here for answers and now I'm not gonna get them! 
Great. 
Great leading, Joey. 
Me? 
Yeah, you. 
I thought monsieur Marcel felt that technology was a distraction. 
For the guests, yeah. 
You seem pretty good at that game. 
He's the best on the whole island. 
It's a pretty small island. 
Doesn't look like it's all that hard. 
Looks like all you gotta do is push these big buttons and play along with the song here. 
Something like that. 
You know what'd be a gas, Sctanley? 
For me and you to play. 
And when I win, you could point me towards the singles side and forget you ever saw us. 
When you beat me? 
When I win, what will you give me? 
Maybe just this. 
$ 1,000 
- A cool G, as we call it back home. 
Are you at liberty to play for that, Sctanley? 
Or would you prefer to play for smiles? 
Monsieur Marcel, I'm sorry to have woken you. 
I thought there was an emergency, but I was mistaken. 
I do apologize. 
I play at expert level. 
You take this kind of serious. 
That's a big screen. 
You've played this before. 
Maybe just a couple times, Sctanley. 
All right, Sctanley, let's have some fun. 
Come on, Sctanley, get him! 
Don't let him get in your head. 
Don't let him get in your head, Dave. 
I know a place you will like. 
Really? 
Yes. 
You will love it. 
What kind of place? 
Like a place that has dancing? 
There is everything. 
Everything? 
Oh, my God, you guys, I want to go dancing! 
You want to go? 
Yes, please, regard me. 
Follow me. 
Oh, my God, yeah, I want to go! 
It'll be a girls' night! 
Okay, but, honey, honey, honey... 
Oh, my God. 
You should just slow down here for a second maybe? 
That's exactly what I need! 
It's the second guitar solo that sorts the men from the boys. 
I was kind of counting on that, Sctan. 
Joey? 
Yeah? 
I think it's time to show the donkey the snake. 
Cut his head, cut his head, cut his head! 
Go, go, go! 
Dave! 
Dave! 
Cut his head! 
Big finish. 
Star power! 
Star power! 
Yes! 
Sctanley, no! 
Yeah! 
You hustled me. 
Yes, I did. 
For that, I'm sorry. 
You see, I sell video games, Sctanley. 
And this one here, in particular, in fact. 
And I'm proud to stand here before you and tell you it brings me as much happiness as it does for the people I provide them to. 
And we had a bet, and I know that you're a man of your word. 
Forget that you saw me and my friends and point me in the direction that I seek. 
I cannot confirm or deny that the one that you seek is on the singles' side. 
But a bet is a bet. 
And I will tell you how to get there. 
The beach is blocked by rocks. 
It's completely impassable. 
No more boats for me and my friends. 
I go by foot. 
I would be remiss if I did not advise you to wait until daylight. 
Do not take this journey lightly. 
Hmm. 
There is an old game path through the forest, just beyond the abandoned Starbucks. 
Take it to where it forks. 
Jog to the right. 
Do not go to the left. 
You will see lights. 
You don't want to go there. 
Keep walking. 
Look up and locate the belt of Orion the Hunter. 
I think we should be writing this down. 
I think Dave's got it. 
The stars shall be your guide. 
As long as we're headed east, that's the direction we're supposed to be going. 
I'm looking for the Little Dipper. 
If I could find the Little Dipper, I could find the North Star. 
Shane, help me find the Little Dipper. 
What do I look like, Harriet Tubman? 
Fine! 
I'll do it by myself, okay? 
You guys are no help! 
Just... 
Just... 
Welcome to Hump Island! 
It's time to feast here in the belly of the beast here at Eden East! 
Now can you feel it? 
Come on! 
Man, we are about to get this party started right! 
You guys ready? 
Bingo! 
Hey, yo, check it out, y'all! 
A luau fire and drum show is coming up real soon! 
Some of the best drummers in the whole world. 
Don't forget to check it out! 
This place is out of control. 
What could she be possibly getting into over here, man? 
Come on, let's not get ahead of ourselves. 
For all we know, she could be sitting in a corner sulking somewhere. 
Hey, we can do this. 
We get in, we get out, we're back before sunrise. 
I know... 
I know that girl. 
San Diego! 
I know that girl. 
I'm gonna go see if I can get some answers out of her. 
What are you talking about? 
I'm trying to find Trudy! 
Talking to locals is the best way to get information! 
You guys should be doing it, too. 
That's a great idea. We split up. 
That way, we find her twice as fast. 
Shane, with me. 
We shouldn't split up, we should stay together. 
Listen, Dave, time is of the essence, okay, and if we don't find her, here's what else. 
We meet back at the exit in, like, an hour, okay? 
Come on. 
Let's go. 
Jason, there's a ton of people here. 
If we split up, we're gonna... 
Stay with Joey. 
This place rocks. 
What are you doing? 
What am I doing? 
I'm trying to have a good time. 
I'm trying to have a party going on. 
Hi. 
Hi. 
Hi. 
We gotta find Trudy. 
I don't want to get into this. 
Come on, buddy. 
What, are you dying to be part of the new singles scene? 
Look at all these people. 
They're running around, they're... 
They're sexting, they're krumping, they're twatting each other'cause their day's so special they have to share it with the world. 
It's called tweeting. 
I call it twatting! 
Look, Joey, we were single. 
We had our fun. 
We're not missing out on anything. 
No, you were single, you had fun. 
I got married early, so I never got to experience this. 
I have a feeling you had a chance to experience lots of things. 
But, look, if you want to go play" Guess Your Disease" 
or" Let Me Translate Your Tribal Tattoo," knock yourself out. 
You don't get it. 
I'm here trapped on an island with a woman who can't even stand the sight of me. 
And whose fault is that? 
It's not my fault! 
Dude, relationships are a two-way street, not a highway and a bike path. 
If it matters to you, work at it. 
And if it doesn't, then don't! 
But make a decision. 
I want to be married'cause I want to have people I can share my life with. 
I don't wanna be doing this. 
I know what I want. 
I want it... Look. 
Hey, Dave, it's not' cause I don't want it, okay? 
You make the best of your situation! 
My situation's to party! 
Yeah! 
Yeah, definitely. 
San Diego! 
Remember me? 
Where have you been? 
Where have I been? 
I've been trying to get here! 
Look, we'll never be able to find her. 
If... 
If I walk over there, she's gonna walk over here. 
If I'm on this side, she's probably gonna be on that side! 
All right, panicking's not gonna help, Shane. 
Hey, want to dance, tough guy? 
No, I'd step on your feet, I'd hurt you. 
Thank you, though. 
All right, now, everybody up, everybody up! This is Eden East! 
This place is amazing! 
I can't believe they kept this from us! 
I knew you would love it. 
This is why I brought you here. 
Vitality! 
Oh, it is so nice to be out with lots of people! 
Everyone's smiling and laughing. 
Don't you guys love this? 
It's great. 
In a couple more minutes, I'll just roofie myself. 
I will go get my special Salvadore drink, yes? 
Oh, yes. 
" Guess I am on my way." 
" Mighty glad you stayed!" 
Yes! 
Yes! 
He is so much fun! 
Oh, God, don't even start. 
I'm just having fun. 
No, it's just... 
Let's just get it together and chill out a little. Guys, this is too much. 
What's too much? 
Excuse me, I don't mean to disturb you. My name's Dave. 
Hi. 
Ronnie. 
Ronnie. 
That's a great name. 
Thank you. Yeah. 
Do you have a cell phone I could use? 
Why? 
Someone's got to call God and let him know one of his angels is missing. 
Wow, that is the worst line I've ever heard. 
Well, what do you want from me? 
I've been out of the game for a while. 
I've been slumming it with a really hot redhead. 
Now you're getting closer. 
Dave, if you're here to be an olive branch for Jason, 
I am not gonna talk about it tonight. 
I'm not here to talk about anything, 
I just want to see my wife. 
Let's go. 
I can't just leave these two. 
I think they'll survive. 
We sure will. 
They are so lucky. 
Now this next jam goes out to all you party people in the house! 
Everybody, up! 
Let's keep this party going, y'all! 
Maybe we ought to wait by the exit, so when people come out, you know... 
Whatever we do, we gotta do it fast. 
I gotta get back, gotta find my wife, you know? 
What do you got? 
You see her? 
That's my wife. 
Jennifer? 
Shane? 
God, Shane, there you are! 
I've been looking all over for you. 
Jennifer, what are you doing here? 
Look, I heard at the salon that you were coming to this crazy singles' island, so I just felt a strong sense of urgency that you and I needed to talk before it was too late. 
Jennifer, you left me, remember? 
I know, I know. 
But then I was hoping that you would come after me. 
It wasn't like you walked out of a bar! 
It was a divorce. 
And why are you even at this place? 
Do you know this place is insane? 
I'm getting called names. 
I've been called a cougar, a black panther, a puma! 
I had to smack this one kid. 
That's the last time he'll walk up to a woman talking about cougar! 
Yeah. 
I've been looking all over the place for you. 
And where have you been? 
Well, actually, I'm staying on the other side, the couples' side, with my girlfriend. 
What? 
Who? 
Her name is Trudy and she's aspiring to be a manager. 
Put it in my mouth! 
Go, go, go! 
Trudy? 
All right, y'all, it's almost time for the mele, the Kanikapila luau drum show! 
The special blend. 
Yes, this is a magical drink. 
You know what? 
I'm gonna go get a good spot for the show. 
Do you guys wanna come? 
No, no, we're good here. 
Okay. 
You're fine? 
Okay. 
And then there was two. 
Listen, I want you to come back with me. 
I'm not going back to the other side with you. 
I'm gonna stay right here, get my celebration on and get another margarita made up in my face. 
I came a long way to find you. 
Well, I know you ain't come to get a drink. 
You damn sure ain't come to dance. 
So what'd you follow me here for? 
No. 
I did. 
I came here to drink, party, scratch records, do it all! 
Do it... 
It's just... 
Just... 
Just... 
You know? 
What am I saying? 
I don't want to do any of those things. 
Truth is that I'm exhausted just saying them. 
All right, y'all, it's time for the Kanikapila luau drum show! 
Cynthia, hi. 
Excuse me. 
Hi. 
Hi. 
Hey, what are you doing here? 
You all right? 
I'm fine, Jason. 
I'm watching the show. 
We do have to get back before sunrise, though. 
Let's get a move on. 
I don't think that's a good idea, Jason. 
Come on, hon. 
Let's go. 
We're very close. 
Jason, I'm not going anywhere. 
It pains me to say this, but I gotta let you go. 
I love you. 
But we cannot do this to each other anymore. It's over. 
It's over. 
Daddy, wait. 
I was wrong. 
I don't want to lose you. 
I'll go back to the other side. 
No. 
Then you... 
You, d be doing what I did. 
Trying to be something that you're not. 
You're 20. 
Go be 20. 
All right? 
I will not lose you. 
All right? 
I cannot lose you. 
You're the whole reason that I'm here. 
You're the whole reason that I've done all of this. 
You're the whole reason that I've made a complete ass out of myself. 
I have failed here miserably. 
And that does not bother me. 
What bothers me is that I have failed you and I am not gonna do that ever again. 
All right? 
I love you a lot. 
Let's go get a drink. 
Oh. 
Honey, it has been forever since we did something like this. 
Yeah. 
You know, baby, it's funny. 
Since we've been here, it's like the therapist and the place has made it like we got a problem. 
But you know what? 
I think we don't have a problem. 
No. 
We got a million problems. 
Really? Yeah. 
But, honey, I think everybody has a million problems. 
I don't know that, like, you, re supposed to solve them all, because the simple truth of it, sweetheart, is we're married. 
We made a commitment to each other and to our families. 
And to myself. 
And I meant it. 
Shane, honey, wait. 
Jennifer, I don't need this. 
I'm done with trying to make you like me. 
I'm not gonna be the man you want me to be. 
I'm not gonna do things the way you want me to do things. 
I'm always gonna wear my heart on my sleeve because that's who I am. 
And I got a lot of friends that like me just because I'm the way I am. 
But it really doesn't matter because I like me. 
Well, I don't like you. 
Whatever. 
I love you. 
I can't stand picking out tiles. 
It drives me nuts to try to redo the fricking house. 
I know it does. 
But, you know, the one thing that we can and should always do is just kind of have fun with each other. 
And truthfully, sweetheart, that should be the easiest thing to do because before there was the kids or the house or the job or any of it, there was just you. 
And I love you, Ronnie. 
I love you, too, Dave. 
Hey, now, all you naughty boys and girls, gather' round, gather' round. 
The hell's she doing here? 
Who? 
That's my wife. 
She must be looking for me. 
I don't think so. 
She looks fine. 
You should just relax. 
Son of a... 
Excuse me! 
Hey! 
Peacock! 
Please, I don't want to hurt you. 
" Encouragement!" Joey! 
Baby, remember when we first met and I told you that you were the only man I'd ever been with? 
You lied? 
No, no, no, no, no. 
I was... 
I was completely inexperienced, and, honey, I didn't know what I had in you. 
I've been cheating on you! 
I've been cheating on you every chance I got! 
Yeah? 
For years, I've been cheating on you. 
Well, I cheated on you with more than one guy! 
With two... 
You had a three-way with two dudes? 
No, no! 
But I would have! 
I totally would have! 
Well, I would've, too! 
Not with two dudes! 
You know what I'm talking about! 
I thought I needed to know what it was like out there, in a real way, not like I read it in Cosmo. 
So I went out there and I lived it. 
I've had one-night stands! 
Okay. 
I've woken up in beds with men whose names I didn't even remember! 
I was like,"' How did I get this T-shirt on? 
,' 
Jennifer, I get it. 
Land your plane. 
Just deal with it! 
You deal with it. 
You deal... 
You deal with going to Applebee's alone. 
What? 
If you don't put in effort, you're gonna be the one who ends up at Applebee's alone. 
Are you asking me to go to Applebee's with you? 
The bottom line is that none of them made me feel the love that you did. 
And I had to go out into the world in order for me to come back and say that I belong home. 
Now I'm gonna keep on spinning these fly tunes until somebody gets something going on! 
I'm not saying I wouldn't go to Applebee's with you! 
Well, I'm not saying I wouldn't go to Applebee's with you! 
All right, well, I would try to go to Applebee's with you. 
Well, I would try to go to Applebee's with you! 
So let's try. 
I want to try! 
Well, let's try! 
I'm sorry. 
I'm so sorry. 
Now I can honestly say, with love in my heart that you are my man. I am so sorry that it took all of that. 
But you know what? 
Could you ever love me again? 
Well, you're my wife. 
And I never stopped loving you. 
Now come here and give me a kiss. 
This next jam goes out to all you party people in the house! 
And that time that you got sick, you didn't want me to see you, so you locked me out of the bathroom? 
No! 
Then I passed out! 
Yeah. 
And you called the ambulance. 
Well, because, before you passed out, it sounded like you were dying in there. 
You know? 
I thought I was dying. 
I did. 
Yeah, well, what was I supposed to do? 
I should have broken down the door. 
You've been a really good friend. 
You have been the best friend in the world to me. 
Now don't stop dancing, y'all! 
Party ain't over! 
It's far from over! 
Silence, please! 
Silence! 
I made a program for you and you decided not to follow it. 
You defied my instructions and you went off course. 
Why are we being held to a different standard, Marcel? 
You weren't here on time this morning. 
I was here before sunrise, sadly, by myself. 
Therefore, I chose not to wait. 
Marcel, I've got to be honest with you. 
You know... 
Silence! 
No, you silence! 
Please, just... 
I don't need some speech about moments, okay? 
No more, okay? 
I'm sorry that we kept you waiting this morning and that we didn't respect your program, but last night my wife and I, we spent some real time together, and for the first time in a long time, 
we woke up actually very, very happy. 
So, with all due respect, sir, 
I don't need you, or anyone else for that matter, to, you know, say anything, really. 
I know. 
Sorry? 
You do? 
Yes. 
That is why I am giving you this. 
I don't understand. 
I could never reveal your true inner animal spirit. 
It was always up to you. 
Cynthia, Jason, your spirit is the rabbit. 
No matter what obstacles are put in front of him, the rabbit will scrape and burrow and find a way to create his home. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. 
Lucy, Joseph. 
For you, the wolf. 
The wolf is by nature a pack animal and one of the few proud members of the animal kingdom that mates for life. 
Congratulations. 
Thank you. 
Hello, Jen. 
Welcome, Jennifer. 
Thank you. 
For you, the noble honeybee. 
The honeybee is committed. 
And though it may fly from flower to flower, collecting the sweet, sticky nectar it has no choice but to return to the hive. 
Congratulations. 
Thank you. 
That's a big-ass bee. 
Finally, Ronnie and David. 
I have thought long and hard about this. 
I could not decide with my mind. 
I had to open my soul to the animal spirits. 
And, finally... 
Okay, the build-up's killing me. 
What do we got here? 
Two cheetahs? 
Couple of eagles? 
You got two lions? 
The ass. 
You are the ass. 
Stubborn and immovable. 
The mighty ass tirelessly bears the heavy burden of others. 
But when the ass is on the move, nothing can stop the ass. 
Be an ass for your marriage. 
Be an ass for your children. 
Be an ass for love. 
Thank you, Marcel. 
I'm gonna be the biggest ass you've ever seen. 
And now, you may spend the rest of your trip enjoying the island. 
Please feel free to make Eden into your own, personal Sandals. 
Yes. 
And now, jet skis! 
Yes, yes! 
Yes! 
Hey, hey, what's happening? 
I sure miss you guys. 
I miss you so much. 
And Grandpa Jim Jim let us watch Jaws! 
We get to eat all the candy we want! 
Hey, guys, the jet skis are ready! 
Come on! 
We're waiting on you! 
Give us one second with the kids. 
We'll be there in a minute. 
Go ahead and start. 
Well, listen, when we get back next weekend, we'll go to Medieval Times and we'll get some big drumsticks and lots of meat. 
- Yes! 
And we're gonna be doing a lot more of that fun stuff, guys, so get ready, okay? 
I'm gonna take you to the school parking lot, we'll do some donuts. 
Yeah! 
Donuts! 
All right, I love you. 
Love you, too. 
Here's Grandpa Jim Jim. 
All right. Enjoy your last few days. 
Hey, Dad, could you do me a favor and not give them candy every time they ask? 
You ought to be thanking me. 
I'm here at this home store returning some of the stuff that you had on that house list. 
Okay, thanks so much. 
- When you look at the coating, will you beat that guy up on the price? 
Kevin! 
That is not a real toilet. 
Dad, what's going on? 
Is everything okay? 
Please tell me he's not peeing in the store. 
It's nice to take a moment and just relax. 
Dad? 
I gotta go. 
I don't know him and there's no way I'm going near him. 
Grandpa, there's no toilet paper. 
Help me get my shirt off. 
You know, the Federal Reserve is a pimp. 
They want you to be in debt. 
They give you these credit cards you can't pay for, 
HD, motorcycles. 
It's all a pimp game. 
MEGA DENG COOPER MINE, INDIA 
Welcome my friend! 
- Great to see you! 
- Glad you made it 
This can't be Ajit. 
He's a little man already. 
Unbelievable. 
I hope you're hungry, Adrian. 
I'm famished. 
How are you, Aparna? 
I made that fish curry you love. 
She gets more beautiful every time I see her, 
Why is that? 
Strange, isn't it? 
But her fish curry is still awful. 
You were mysterious on the phone. 
Why didn't you attend the conference? 
I will show you, Adrian, sir. 
Satnam. Stop sir-ing me. 
How deep do we need to go? 
11.000 feet. 
Searched all over India for this dig. 
Used to be the deepest copper mine in the world. 
Remember my brother Gurdeep? 
He's a student now. 
Namaste, Dr Helmsley, sir. 
Adrian. 
It's just Adrian. 
Just don't pour too much, okay? 
How do you work in this heat? 
You've come on a good day, my friend. 
Sometimes it can be 120 ° F. 
I want you to meet Dr Lokesh? 
Fellow of Quantum Physics at the University in Chennai 
- Namaste 
- Dr Helmsley 
So, what are we looking at? 
These neutrinos are acting normally. 
No mass, no electrical charge. 
They pass through ordinary matter almost undisturbed. 
Your message said the count doubled after the last solar eruptions. 
That was last week. 
But this happened two days ago. 
The biggest solar eruptions in human history. 
Causing the highest neutrino count we've ever recorded. 
My God. 
That's not what worries me, Adrian. 
For the first time ever the neutrinos are causing a physical reaction 
That's impossible. 
Ah! 
That feels very good! 
Please, follow me. 
You wont believe this. 
This water tank goes down another 6000 feet. 
It looks like the neutrinos coming from the sun have mutated into a new kind of nuclear particle. 
They're heating up the Earth's core. 
And suddenly act like microwaves. 
Ladies and gentlemen. As promised : 
No speech! 
Just a" thank you". 
Because tonight, with your extraordinary generosity, we have raised 1.7 million dollars. 
It's okay. 
- I work for the White House. 
- I don't care who you are, sir 
This is a black tie event. 
Scotty! 
Hey, Adrian, I thought you were in India 
What's going on? - I need your jacket 
- What? 
I gotta speak to Anheuser 
- I don't wanna give... - Give me your damn jacket! 
Take it, please. 
Mr Anheuser? 
Mr Anheuser? 
I need to talk to you. 
Sorry sir, my name is Dr Adrian Helmsley 
I'm a deputy geologist at the Office of 
Science and Technology Policy 
Excuse me, fellows. 
You know that this is a fund-raiser, not a frat party, right? 
It's extremely important, sir. 
It always is. 
Here is what I want you to do : 
Make an appointment or even better, 
Have your boss bring it up at the quarterly science briefing 
There's a good plan. 
I just traveled 20 straight hours to get here, sir. 
I haven't slept in two days. 
You need to read this, sir. 
You need to read it now! 
Let me guess. 
National geology crisis? 
Excuse me. 
Who do you report to? 
Lico Vasos 
Not anymore. 
Al, bring the car around. 
You may wish you took a shower. 
You're about to meet the president. 
What's going on? 
Get that to the office. 
G8 SUMMIT, BRITISH COLUMBIA 
Good morning. 
I would like to meet privately with my fellow heads of state. 
Mr wishes to have his interpreters present. 
Mr President, I can assure you 
Your English is more than sufficient for what I have to say. 
Mr President. 
Six months ago, I was made aware of a situation so devastating that at first 
I refused to believe it. 
However, through the concerted efforts of our brightest scientists, we have confirmed its validity. 
The world as we know it will soon come to an end. 
CHO MING VALLEY, TIBET 
This dam project will create many new jobs. 
The Party and Country will assist in your re-location. 
Grandma, give me your hand. 
But where are they taking us? 
It'll be alright. 
Brother! 
Grandma, I will send you money. 
Who can write? 
Who can read? 
Who can weld? 
EMPIRE GRAND HOTEL, LONDON 
Has His Highness had an opportunity to study the dossier? 
You must understand I have a big family, Mr... 
Isaacs. 
One billion dollars is a lot of money. 
I'm afraid the amount is in Euros, 
Your Highness. 
MUSÉE DU LOUVRE, PARIS 
I put a lot of faith into your organization. 
It's a perfect replica, Roland. 
There are too many fanatics out there that could damage her. 
Just think about the beautiful 
Buddha statues they blew up in Afghanistan. 
Our Heritage Organization has already made selections from the British Museum and Hermitage. 
I guess she'll be safe now, tucked away. 
Hidden, in some bunker in Switzerland. 
Perfectly safe, Roland. 
Only infrared analysis can reveal the difference. 
But it's still a fake. 
This mass suicide was actually discovered by a documentary crew here in the ancient Mayan city of Takal 
Now the victims, and we've seen many, are said to have adhered to the Mayan-Quiche calender, which predicts the end of time to occur on the 21st December of this year, due to the suns destructive forces. 
Thank you, Mark. 
Strangely enough, scientific records do support the fact that we are heading for the biggest solar climax in recorded history. 
MANHATTAN BEACH, CALIFORNIA 
Many people believe that the Mayan Calender predicts that there's supposed to be a galactic alignment... 
I'm a dead man. 
Hey, Kate, I'm practically on the freeway right now. 
Yes, I'm rolling towards you as we speak. 
Would you relax? 
I'll be there any second. 
You know it's a vacation and not a doctors appointment, right? 
It's supposed to be fun. 
You remember fun, don't you Kate? 
Do you remember where you were when it stopped being fun for you? 
Got it. 
Oh yeah, cause it's mosquito season in Yellowstone. 
I got a whole bunch. 
I gotta go, I'm in a bad reception area. 
Woah, man. 
Would you look at that? 
Sick 
Merrill, I told you. 
We have to move back to Wisconsin. 
These little mini-quakes are really getting on my nerves, Randy. 
Come on, a little surface crack, you're not gonna be inconvenienced by that 
Surface cracks, I've got a plastic surgeon for that 
No kidding. 
Thank God for those shake-proof coffee mugs. 
They show the true nature of us Californians. 
We'll not bow to these little inconvenient things like surface quakes. 
Do you have a funny mini-quake story and want to share it? 
Call Lisa Randy at 555... 
- Hi daddy! 
- Hi baby 
- How are you sweety? 
- Good Jackson, what is this? 
- Please don't call me that. 
I'm your dad. 
Taking them camping in a limo? 
Okay, great. 
What happened to your temp job? 
Better hours, more time to write. 
What about sleeping, have you been doing that lately? 
I've said it a thousand times. 
No lipo on Fridays. 
It's too messy. 
Hold on. 
- Morning Jackson. - Hi 
- Nice ride. 
- Thanks. 
Have a nice trip. 
Remember, watch out for the bears. 
- Bye, Gordon 
- Love you, Honey. 
Bye 
Okay, so... 
- You tell him. 
Tell me what? 
She needs to put these on every night before she goes to sleep. 
Still? Yes. 
Your 7 year old daughter still wets her bed. 
Maybe that's something you should know. 
- Love you 
- Love you, Mom. 
- Hey 
- You okay? 
They really were looking forward to spending some time with you 
I know. 
So don't be on your computer all the time. 
Got it. 
Love you! 
- So this time we'll hit Japan. 
- So? Now you can visit your boy, Will. 
Afternoon, ladies! 
Are you even listening to me? 
Unfortunately I am, Harry. 
I heard from Audrey you're a grandpa now. 
Would you mind keeping your nose out of my family? 
You're cramping my style, baby. 
There we are. 
So he married a Japanese girl, how's that the end of the world? 
Come on Tony, you should at least go see him. 
- You see your boy? 
- Not as much as I'd like 
DC is a long way, but at least we talk 
About what? 
Life. 
And how short it is. 
What the hell was that? 
- Hello? 
- Laura? 
Laura, can you hear me? 
Laura, they lied to us. 
I've arranged a press conference for tomorrow. 
I will tell everyone the truth about what is going on. 
What are you talking about? 
The art you collected is not in the Alps. 
Those tunnels are empty. 
I have proof! 
Laura, can you hear me? 
I'm losing you, Roland. 
Laura, can you hear me? 
YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK 
- I liked that song. 
- We lost it. 
... the west coast with all those surface cracks, 
I told myself : 
Charlie, get your stupid ass to Yellowstone. 
I don't want to miss all the fun when it finally goes. 
Let me tell you, there's been government people flying in and out all morning and trust me, they do not look happy. 
Always remember, folks... 
- It's weird. 
Can you believe he said that? 
What are the odds? 
We're not seeing the soil liquefaction we'd expect or any evidence of fracture propagation within the tectonic plates. 
- English, doctor. 
- The seismic activity on the west coast is not caused by tect... regular earth quakes. 
And these surface cracks have nothing to do with shifting fault lines. 
Are you suggesting this could be the beginning of the Joline operation? 
- Dr Helmsley is flying to 
Yellowstone to collect more data, sir. 
We've been following the schedule you established, Mr Helmsley. 
The most important schedule in the history of mankind. 
Now you're telling me we have to throw it out? 
Yes, sir. 
I was wrong. 
Do you know how many times I've heard those words in this office? 
Zero. 
Did you see this? 
I'm sorry Mr President. 
She insisted. 
It's all over the news. 
We are learning more about this deadly car explosion, 
The director of the French National Museum was scheduled to hold a press conference at the Louvre this morning. 
Coincidentally, his death took place in the same Paris tunnel where Princess Diana died in 1997. 
We are continuing to follow this story... 
Laura, I don't believe you've met Dr Helmsley. 
I just talked to him Dad, and he told me... the organization I work for is a sham. 
Why would he say that? 
You look just like your mother when you get upset. 
- Did I ever tell you that? 
- Every time I get upset. 
Daddy, a man was killed. 
Honey. Please sit down. 
Only a dozen people in this administration know what I'm about to tell you. 
Dad, what's going on? 
An unprecedented international endeavor is under way. 
At this point 46 nations are invested in this thing. 
Laura's a smart girl. She'll understand. 
That thing in Paris. 
We're not involved in any of that, are we? 
" We"? Who the hell is" we"? 
What are you talking about? 
What we need to do is focus on this time line. 
So when do we let the country know? 
What do you mean? 
- The people, sir. 
They need to know. 
Well of course they do. 
Listen. 
Your job is to figure out when this is all gonna fall apart. 
My job is to figure out how to retain some type of government after it falls apart. 
Until then we don't have time for anything except those jobs. 
Okay? 
Call me when you have any news from Yellowstone. 
- Cute girl, huh? 
- Sir? 
The First Daughter, I saw you looking at her. 
- I wasn't looking at her 
- Better move fast kid 
The end is near. 
Your chopper's ready. 
They're waiting on the south lawn. 
- Daddy, where are we going? 
- This special place I know 
Actually, it's a place where your mom and I used to hang out a lot. 
I don't want to know where you and mom had sex. 
I'm not ready for that, Jackson. 
Stop calling me that, it's creeping me out. 
What's wrong with" Dad"? 
Daddy, look at this. 
That wasn't here before. 
What did I do? 
Go get your hat. 
Can't you see the signs? 
There used to be a lake here. 
Doesn't look much of a lake to me. 
I know. The whole damn thing's gone. 
Come on, let's check it out. 
Great. 
Subjects have now entered hot zone. 
What is that? 
It's the U.S. Army. 
All manner of government vehicle are converging on subjects. 
You're in a restricted area, sir. 
We need you and your family to come with us. 
Right. 
Okay, we're gonna go with these guys. 
That'll be fun, huh? 
This is wild. 
This is really wild. 
This is unbelievable. 
2700 ° C at 40.000 feet? 
I know, it sounds completely implausible. 
Nonetheless, we're noticing an increase of almost 0.5 % 
- Per day? 
- No. Per hour. 
Dr Helmsley, we arrested some tourists in the hot zone. 
I'll take care of it. 
Let's get Satnam on the communications link. 
Cross reference the data. 
It's a national park, there's not supposed to be fences. 
What's going on here? 
We're geologists. 
You usually go digging with machine guns? 
Major, I'll take care of this, thank you. 
So what happened to the lake? 
Well that's what we're trying to find out. 
We think the entire area has become unstable. 
I think you should take your kids and leave, Mr... 
Curtis. 
You're not by any chance the Jackson Curtis who wrote" Farewell Atlantis"? 
The very same. 
It's actually dedicated to my mom. 
I read a couple of your short stories in college. 
Your father is a very talented man 
Listen up. 
It's amazing. I'm reading your book. 
I'm around day 300, the shuttle has just lost communication with Earth. 
You're one of the lucky few who bought it. 
- I didn't buy it. 
- No? My dad gave it to me. 
Let me ask you something. 
Do you think those people would behave so selflessly knowing that their own lives were at stake? 
I hope so. 
The critics said I was naive, an unabashed optimist, but what do they know, right? 
It was a great pleasure meeting you. 
Mayor, could you escort these good people to the camp grounds, please. 
This is yours. 
- Thank you 
- Yes, sir. 
- Take care. 
- Okay 
He was very nice. 
You're just saying that cause you like my book. 
Looks like that boy of yours is gonna be smarter than any of us. 
What's wrong? 
I sent Satnam the temperature readings. 
My colleagues in Argentina and Ontario have almost identical data. 
It's so hot here we've had to seal off the mine. 
Did you double check the numbers? 
I triple checked, my friend. 
I wish we were wrong, but we're not. 
The Earth's crust is destabilizing. 
It's too early. 
Adrian. You have to begin the evacuation. 
My God. 
All our scientific advances, our fancy machines, the Mayans saw this coming thousands of years ago. 
I thought we'd have more time. 
Okay. 
Okay, I want you to pack up your family. 
I'm gonna arrange an airlift from Delhi. 
Thank you my friend. 
And good luck. 
Ajit. 
We are going on a big ship. 
Wait. 
Wait, wait. 
Sorry. 
One question. 
What did the government guys say to you? 
They don't like us going over their fences and that the whole area back there is unstable. 
" Unstable"? 
They said" unstable"? 
That's funny. 
Let's go. 
" Unstable". 
It's not just Yellowstone, sir. 
Temperatures are rising with incredible velocity in hot zones across the globe. 
Are you absolutely sure about this, Adrian? 
Once we give these orders, there's no going back. 
I'm afraid there's no longer any doubt. 
We have to save what we can. 
And we have to move now! 
There's mosquitoes in here. 
Did anybody spray the tent? 
I'm gonna get that spray tomorrow. 
They just like you because your blood's so sweet. 
Dad, you said you wouldn't work on your book. 
What? 
I'm not, I'm doing something else. 
Okay. 
Did you really need all these hats? 
Where are your pull-ups? 
I have them on. 
Who gave you this? Mommy? No, Gordon gave it to me for my birthday. 
A cell phone is something we got to talk about 
As a family. 
What family? 
It hurts my feelings when you say stuff like that. 
Go away. 
Adults get hurt feelings too. 
No way. 
... tell the truth. 
Thank you, Bill. 
What is your question? 
I wanted to know, where is all this gonna start? 
Well, something like this could only originate in Hollywood. 
They have the earth cracking under their asses already. 
Our family believes in the gospel of the lord Jesus. 
We have nothing to fear, Charlie. 
Good for you, Bill. 
Thanks for calling. 
This is Charlie Frost reporting live from 
Yellowstone National Park, soon to become the worlds largest active volcano. 
I'll be right back, folks. 
Do you mind if I join you? 
I wanted to ask you something. 
I only got a minute. 
Pickle? 
I was listening to the broadcast and I was wondering what exactly is it that's gonna start in Hollywood? 
It's the Apocalypse. 
End of days. The Judgment Day. 
The end of the world, my friend. 
Christians call it The Rapture, but the Mayans knew about it, the Hopis, 
The I Ching, the Bible. 
- Beer? 
- Yeah. 
So look, I gotta eat. 
Why don't you download my blog? 
It's free. 
Of course, we do appreciate donations. 
In ancient times, the Mayan people were the first civilization to discover that this planet had an expiration date. 
According to their calender, in the year 2012 a cataclysmic event will unfold, caused by an alignment of the planets in our solar system that only happens every 640.000 years. 
Oh, not again. 
Neat, huh? 
I did all the animation myself. 
Just imagine the earth as an orange 
You lure them in with humor. 
Then you make them think. Our sun will begin to emit such extreme amounts of radiation, 
Screw you bastards. 
That the core of the earth will melt at the inside part of the orange. 
Leaving the crust of our planet free to shift. 
In 1958 Professor Charles Hapgood named it : 
" Earth Crust Displacement" Albert Einstein did support it. 
People will get it all, the forces of Mother Nature will be so devastating It will bring an end to this world on winter Solstice 12-21-12. 
Always remember, folks. 
You heard it first from 
Charlie Frost. 
You'd have to keep a thing like this under wraps. 
Just think about it. 
First, the stock market would go. 
Then the economy : 
Boom! The dollar : 
Boom! 
And then pandemonium in the street. 
War, genocide. 
Boom Boom Boom! 
Bullshit. Nobody could keep that big a secret, Charlie. 
Somebody would blow the whistle 
An every once in a while, some poor sucker tries. 
Like these guys. 
Boom! 
Boom! Every one of these guys : 
Dead! 
Dead! 
Woah, that's Professor Meyers. 
He ran the Atlantis Shuttle Program. 
Did you know him? 
- Yeah, he helped me out with research on my book. 
Well, that must have been before his accident. 
- Meyers is dead? 
- Yeah, two months ago. 
He was one of my most avid listeners. 
He had it all figured out. 
Everything the government was doing, where, why. 
He even sent me a map. 
A map for what, Charlie? 
What's the map for? 
They're building space ships, man. 
Shit, man, I have to go. 
I gotta get back to Earth. 
- Do you have a beer? 
- This is my last. 
- Alright, I really enjoyed most of this. 
Thank you so much. 
- Guess what, they're selling seats! 
- Put me down for three. 
- No! Guys like you and me don't have any chance. 
You'd have to be Bill Gates or Rupert Murdoch or some Russian billionaire. 
Keep it down, my kids are sleeping. 
Get them out of Yellowstone. 
It's gonna get ugly here. 
Why don't we make a baby? 
We're not making a baby at the supermarket. 
Hands off the merchandise. 
Honey, woman give me thousands of dollars to handle their boobs. 
You always act strange after he shows up. 
I'm not acting strange, I'm looking for macaroni. 
So why did you stick with him so long anyways? 
Can we just give it a rest, please? 
- He's the father of my children. 
- Oh, come on, Kate You gave up med school so you could have Noah. 
You practically raised him and Lilly by yourself while he sat glued to a laptop writing that junk. 
It's not junk! He's published. 
Oh, published. 
Right, I forgot. 422 copies. 
- Did you see that? 
- See what? Kate, listen, we have to keep working at this. 
Our relationship. 
I don't know, Honey, I feel like there's something pulling us apart. 
Grab the pole! 
Kate, don't let go! 
Do you have anything for mosquito bites? 
Before or after? 
- I'll get before and after. 
- Stop scratching or you're gonna get it all infected. 
... and I had to make a quick stop at the grocery store... 
It's Mrs Birnbaum 
She's my teacher. 
She's on TV! 
... market which was open for business at the time but fortunately there are no fatalities or injuries reported. 
It really is a miracle that no one got hurt. 
Hello? Hi mom. 
Did you see what happened to our supermarket? 
She wants us to come home. 
Is this even possible? 
We worked every option through the night. 
The good news : consensus is that 4 of the Arks will be operational in time. 
- Only 4? You call that good news? 
- We can save over 400.000 people. 
To me, sir, that's nothing short of a miracle. 
But we have to initiate the boarding process now. 
Thomas. We don't have a choice. 
You have got to convince them. 
According to the latest information... 
- Please continue, Adrian. 
- Thank you, sir. 
The temperature of the subterranean crust, that is the cement that holds our landmass in place, 
Is increasing at a rapid rate much faster than anticipated. 
As a result we've observed extreme polar instability 
The magnetic fields have decreased by more than 80 % in the last 48 hours. 
How much time do we have, Dr Helmsley? 
Two, maybe three days, if we're lucky. 
How can you speak about luck in such a situation? 
Apologies, Mr Prime Minister. 
I meant no disrespect. 
I'm afraid the longer we wait, the more luck plays its part. 
My friends. 
I recommend we evacuate immediately. 
If any of you have objections 
Please speak now. 
In the blue corner : 
38 victories, 34 knockouts, 
The fighting machine from the Ukraine 
The undefeated number one ranked heavyweight challenger : 
Mr. Zultan Balashin! 
- Yuri! 
- Zultan! I feared you would not come. 
He needs to concentrate now. 
Mr Karpov. You shut up while I talk to my boy, understand? 
- Yes, Mr Karpov. 
- Good. That is good. 
Zultan, listen to me. 
We are fighters, we never go down. 
No matter how hard they hit us. 
Kill the bastard. 
Let's get ready to rumble! 
ATTENTION : 
START BOARDING PROCEDURE 
Yuri, where are you going? 
Yuri! 
CalTech believes that the fissures running through 
Westwood has released most of the surface tension. 
Life in the city will soon return to normal, 
Mayor Gonzales said... 
Okay guys. 
Almost home. 
Rise and shine. 
Alright, you're free. 
Mommy! 
Hi, sweetheart. 
Gordon! 
Hey, buddy boy. 
Had a good time? 
God, I missed you. 
- Who wants pancakes? 
Thanks for bringing them home early. 
Yeah. 
Pancakes? 
Late for work. 
- Yes, hello? 
- Curtis, where are you? 
- Just back from vacation, sir. 
- Good. 
That is good. I will send a jet to pick up Alec and Oleg. 
Yuri bear. Tell him to bring the rain coat for Caesar. 
It's in the Range Rover. 
- Curtis? 
- Yeah Get my boys as fast as you can. 
I'm hurling towards you as we speak, sir. 
Good. 
- Curtis, you're late. 
- Good morning to you too. 
Be careful with our stuff. 
Don't get your dirt on it. 
Took you a while, Mr. Curtis. 
What's your problem? 
Be more careful. He did that on purpose. 
Have a safe trip, you little bastards. 
Now you're laughing, Curtis. 
But we have tickets to go on a big ship. 
We will leave, and you will die. 
Did you hear that? 
The authorities in L.A. 
say there's nothing to worry about. 
I'd love to see their faces when Malibu and Beverly Hills sink down into the Pacific. 
Where will they plug in their electric cars then? 
Hey! - Is this your plane? 
- Yeah 
- Are you a pilot? 
- Yeah 
I want to rent it, okay? 
I'll give anything you want. 
Here, take this very expensive watch. My neighbor gave it to me when he thought I was gonna be somebody. 
... CalTech, that in the last 36 hours we have basically zero earthquake activity in Southern California, which is very rare. 
Unlike the tough characters I have portrayed in my films... 
Hello? Hey. 
Stop what you're doing. 
- Jackson? Listen to me. I've rented a plane, pack up the kids, 
I'm gonna be there in 5 minutes. 
What are you talking about? 
We're gonna have a regular Saturday. Noah has music at 2 : 00 and Lilly has karate. 
You expect him to remember? 
Kate, California is going down. 
- Pack up the kids now! 
- They just got back. 
God, you sound like a crazy person. The governor just said we're fine now. 
The guy's an actor, he's reading a script! 
When they tell you not to panic 
That's when you run! 
Will you call me back when you calm down? 
Mommy, why are you acting so crazy? 
Finish your pancakes, Al Capone. 
... it seems to me that the worst is over. 
Hold Mommy's hands! 
Let's go! - I think it's safer under here! 
Get in the fucking car! 
Come on, kids! 
Get in. 
Get in. My hats! 
Buckle up! 
Sorry. 
Jackson. 
Hurry up! 
Oh God. 
Get out of the way! 
- Move it! Hold on, dear. 
Come on, you old bags! 
We gotta get to Santa Monica Airport. 
Take the freeway. 
Yeah, right. 
We gotta get to the other side of the freeway. 
Dad, look! 
They've just been upgraded to a 10.9 by Harvard. 
What does CalTech have to say? 
The city of Pasadena was wiped out. 
Just a few minutes ago. 
This is coming in live from Coachella Valley near Joshua Tree. 
That huge canyon, It wasn't there this morning. 
100 miles further North, same thing. 
The San Andreas Fault is shifting. 
Yes. And all major sister faults in the bay area. 
The whole Pacific Plate is destabilizing. 
Come on! 
- Who's that? 
Dead pilot! 
Gordon! 
You can fly! 
I've only had a couple of lessons in a single engine plane only. 
- You're the guy! 
- No, I'm not the guy! Trust me! 
You're the guy. I'm not being modest about this! 
Come on, kids. 
Gordon's gonna get us out of here. That plane has multiple engines. 
Jackson! 
- T's and P's 
- TNP? - What? 
- Temperatures and Pressures 
- Let's go! 
- My preflight check Let him concentrate, Jackson. 
He has no experience. 
Thank you. 
Gordon! 
Go! 
We're not there yet. 
- Punch it! 
- We need 85 knots. 
- 80 is good! 
Okay, we're up. 
Lilly, go sit with your brother. 
How did you know this would happen? 
It's not just California. 
The whole damn world is going to shit. 
I met this crazy guy in Yellowstone 
But he's been right about everything so far 
He said the government is building these ships, space ships, I don't know what, but something... 
- Space ships? 
Yeah. 
Places where we could be safe. 
He knows where they are. 
He's got a map. 
- Jackson... - Kate, trust me on this. 
Guys. 
But it ain't the end of the world, Buddy. 
It's only the end of this song. 
It's been a gas, been a flip, been a hell of a trip, But it ain't the end of the world. 
Oh yeah! 
- Thank you. 
Thank you. 
There's a call for you, Harry. 
Want me to take a message? 
Yeah, hello? 
- Dad? 
- Adrian! Remember I told you about that dam in China? 
- Yeah. - It's happening, Dad. 
They'd probably shoot me if they knew I told you. 
Nobody's gonna shoot you, son. 
They need you. 
The President has ordered us to clear out the White House. 
About time somebody cleaned up that mess. 
Where are you, Dad? 
What is the course of The Genesis right now? 
It's all good, Adrian. 
Don't you be worrying about your old man. 
You have more important things to do now. 
You know... 
Your mom and I... 
We had one hell of a great life, son. 
And the best part about that... 
We had one hell of a great kid, too. 
This Genesis is a pretty big ship, son. 
Don't you write your old man off just yet. 
Besides... You know I couldn't leave Tony alone. 
That old fool can't keep decent time by himself. 
I love you, Dad. 
I love you too, son. 
Herb. I want a double. 
- Harry... 
Thank you, son. 
After 25 year on the wagon. 
- What are you doing? 
- Gotta go. 
Anything? 
Yeah, there's fuel. 
Fill her up, I'm gonna gonna go find Charlie. 
Daddy, wait, I wanna come with you! 
No Lil! 
No! It's alright, I'll take her. 
Just fill it up 
I'll be right back. 
Jackson, hurry please! 
I'm standing here at the highest point of what is the rim of the worlds largest super volcano, Mount Big Horn. 
Charlie! 
I can only hope that all of you have made your peace 
It's gotta be around here somewhere. 
- Let's go back, Daddy. 
- No no no We gotta find Charlie, cause he's got a map. 
It's like a secret map. 
Like in pirate movies. 
We gotta work as a team, okay? 
- Okay 
- Okay, come on. 
Call Mom. 
- Noah. 
- I need to talk to Mom. 
- It's Lilly. 
- Sweety, where are you? 
- Hi Mommy 
- Let me speak to Daddy He cant talk right now. 
He's driving really fast. 
- Ouch! - Lilly? 
Who is that? 
Who's speaking in the car? 
He's not in the car, he's on a mountain waiting for fireworks. 
Fireworks? 
What fireworks? 
Daddy, over there. 
Good job, Lilly. 
Let me talk to mom now. 
- Hey! We got him. 
- Bring back my child! 
You stay here. 
I will go talk to the pirate, okay? 
Charlie! 
Charlie! 
What are you doing? 
I thought you were toast. 
No no no! Where are the space ships? 
No way you can make it there. 
We have a plane. 
You can come with us. 
But we gotta leave right now! 
Fly birdies! 
Is this your kid? 
Where's the god damn map? 
Where's the map? 
- It's in the camper. - Where in the camper? 
Map section. 
On the conspiracy shelf. 
Dewey Decimal System. 
Between Roswell... and Marilyn Monroe? 
It's starting. 
You sure you don't wanna come with me? 
So beautiful, I'm gonna stay. 
Good luck. 
This marks 
The last day of the United States of America 
Final hour of all mankind. 
As we will be visible from the Milky Way as a tiny little puff of smoke. 
I'm watching the Earth crumble before my eyes. 
The giant ash cloud created by this super volcano will first envelop Vegas, and then St. Louis and then Chicago, and then at long last, 
Washington D.C. will have its lights go out. 
That guy is crazy, right Daddy? Don't think so. 
This is ridiculous. 
It's been over half an hour. 
- The guy is a nut job. - Stop it. 
Noah, give me the phone again. 
Daddy. What was that? Nothing. 
Nothing. 
I have goosebumps, people! 
I wish you could see what I'm seeing, people. 
I wish you could be here with me! 
Oh, baby! 
Bring it on! 
Always remember folks : 
You heard it first from Charlie! 
Daddy, it's following us! 
Get down on the ground and hold on. 
Don't look back. Just look at me. 
- Do I look scared? 
- Uhum. 
Hold on baby. Hold on tight. 
Daddy, we're on fire! 
There they are! 
It's them. 
It's them! 
Mommy! 
Shit. 
Hang on baby. Hang on 
Mommy. 
- Lil, grab my hand. - Come on, Noah. 
Lilly, you okay? 
Everybody on? Ready? 
- Jackson! 
Where is he? What's he doing? 
No! 
- Daddy! 
- No! 
We have to go. 
No, we're not going anywhere! Kids, buckle up. 
We're leaving. 
He's my dad. 
We're gonna wait! 
No! 
Daddy! 
Wait! Wait. 
Roland, I see something. 
It's Daddy! 
Slow down! 
Jackson, come on! 
Grab! 
We're running out of runway. For God's sakes, Kate, pull him up. 
Reach for my hand! 
- Come on! 
- Daddy! 
Right. 
Here we go! 
Faster. 
Faster. 
Hang on 
- Go faster! 
- I'm trying! 
Okay. 
We're good. We're good. 
Now that you got your map, where are we going? 
CHINA 
We're gonna need a bigger plane. 
You just said that, Mom. You just said that. 
You don't remember that you just said that? 
That's okay. Listen, Mom. 
I'll call you next week, same time. Okay? 
Take care now. 
Take care of yourself. 
I think you need to see this. 
I thought they'd give you an extra ticket, Sir. They did. 
But my mother is almost 89. 
She's in a wheelchair. 
And she is easily confused. 
And I am confident that she'll want to meet her maker 
- on her own terms. Okay? 
- Yes, sir. 
- Who are you bringing? - Nobody. 
My ex-wife said she never wanted to see me again. 
So be it. We could bring people that contribute. 
... has been damaged by a series of major earthquakes. 
The death toll is expected to be well over 2 million people. 
The devastation in Rio de Janeiro is beyond imagination. 
Two 8.5 tremors have left the people in the street fighting for resources. 
In the last hour we received this video from Globo News, Brazil. 
What's happening? 
My God! 
The statue of Christ is collapsing! 
Fear and chaos have spread throughout the globe. 
As in London, where the 30th Olympic Games has been suspended. 
Hundreds of thousands are marching towards 10 Downing Street demanding a lift of the information blackout proposed by the Prime Minister. 
Thousands of calls to the switchboard. We had to shut it down. 
We're receiving reports from all across the globe. 
Millions of distraught masses are gathering in public places everywhere, converging in desperate prayer. 
Preachers of many faiths have taken their message of the end of the world to the streets all over the U.S. 
There is still time. 
Kind of gaulling when you realize the nutbags with the cardboard signs had it right the whole time. 
All these people out there, sir. 
Shouldn't we be issuing warnings now? 
Only when the boarding process is complete. That's the plan. 
British Columbia 2010, remember? 
Sir, those plans were drawn up 2 years ago. 
Okay, everybody out. 
Come on, get out. 
Wasn't it also decided that people have the right to fight for their lives, best way they can? 
After we get everyone on board, Adrian. 
I think that's wrong. 
Want to tell everyone they're doomed? There'd be anarchy. 
You want to jeopardize the departure of the president? 
Our mission is to assure the continuity of our species. 
My question : 
Can I count on you? 
Can I? 
What? 
The Yellowstone Caldera has erupted, sir. 
The ash cloud will reach Washington in 7 hours. 
We've got to get away. 
Where is the president, Sally? Said he wanted to spend some time alone. 
- I think he's at the chapel. 
- He's going to church now? 
He's praying, sir. 
Which is not such a bad idea. 
Mr. President. I need to get you on 
Air Force One immediately. 
Give me a moment with Adrian. 
No disrespect sir, we do not have time. 
Make time. 
Did you ever meet my wife : Dorothy? 
No sir, I never had that honor. 
She was in and out towards the end 
The night before she passed on, she took 
" I think you should have a lottery" 
" Everyone should have a chance to go" 
Maybe that's what we should have done. 
I'll be the last president of the United States of America. 
Do you know how that feels, son? 
No one could have saved the country, sir. 
And I think, I think people have a right to know. 
Don't worry, I'll take care of that. 
Go on now. 
Not without you, sir. 
Get on that plane, son. 
It's a brave new world you head into 
And a young scientist will be worth 20 old politicians. 
We should go to my parents house in the Rockies. 
This isn't one of your crazy stories, now. Right, Jackson? How the hell are we going to make it to China? 
Hey, Gordon. 
Without Jackson we wouldn't have made it out of California. 
Noah, please. 
Be careful with the landing gear! 
Easy gringo, I know what I'm doing. Attention! 
The National Guard has informed us that an extremely hazardous ash cloud is headed for the city of Las Vegas. 
Where are you going? 
You can't stay here. 
- I have a plane here. 
- It's not safe. 
So you got positive confirmation on this? 
Thank you, I understand. 
The President is not coming. 
So, the Captain won't abandon his sinking ship. 
That's his choice, and a noble one. 
I have also just learned that the Vice President's chopper went down in the ash cloud outside Pittsburgh. 
Fortunately, we have protocols to follow. What about the Speaker of the House? 
In this chaos, I have no idea. 
Where is he? 
He's the Commander in Chief now, sir. 
This is one flight he shouldn't be late for. 
Tell the Captain we're taking off. Sir, you don't have the authority. 
Who got the authority? 
You? You got the authority? 
You couldn't even keep your damn mouth shut. 
You betrayed top secret information. 
What the hell are you talking about? 
You told your father everything, put this entire plan in jeopardy, 
Good thing for you the old man could keep his mouth shut better than you. 
Don't look so shocked. 
We had to monitor everybody who knew, 
How do you think we kept it a secret for so long? 
So you just killed anybody who tried to talk? 
Anybody who tried to talk was not just an enemy of the state. 
They were an enemy of humanity. 
The director of the Louvre was an enemy of humanity? 
After he called a press conference he was. 
Jesus, what did you think? 
We're all just gonna get on board, hold hands and sing Kumbaya? 
Sit down and buckle up. 
Excuse me, is my father in the Command Center? 
President is on the line, Dr Wilson. 
Thank you. 
Where are you? 
You never would've gotten on that plane if I told you. 
But you said that you'd be here Darling, listen to me. 
Do you understand how much strength it gives me knowing that you will survive? 
The only thing left to do now, is tell the truth to people. 
At least if they know, families can say goodbye to each other. 
A mother can comfort her children. 
And a father... can ask his daughter for forgiveness. 
Whenever you're ready, Mr President. 
My fellow Americans 
This will be the last time I address you. 
As you know, catastrophe has struck our nation. 
Has struck the world. 
I wish I could tell you we could prevent the coming destruction. 
We cannot. 
Today, none of us are strangers. 
Today, we are one family, stepping into the darkness together. 
We are a nation of many religions, but I believe these words reflect the spirit of all our faiths : 
" The lord is my Shepard. I shall..." 
Get away from the doors and windows. 
What are we gonna do? You tell me. 
- Dr Silberman? 
- Tamara! 
What are you doing here? 
She's a patient, Honey. 
Excuse me, I have a private plane out there. 
Karpov! Yuri! 
You knew. 
This whole time you knew. 
You've got a way out of here, right? You got a plane? 
My family, take us with you. 
Boss, boss. 
I found us a plane. An Antonov. 
They were just about to take off, but the tower didn't let them. 
Can you still fly that thing? 
Sure, Boss, but I need co-pilot. 
Gordon's a pilot. 
No, I'm not. Yes he is. 
Great pilot. 
Let's go. 
Good. 
Let's go! 
Jackson, stop saying I'm a pilot. 
You can't go out there. Come back! 
Move back, people! 
Wow, that's a big plane. 
It's Russian. Let's move everybody. 
Come on! 
- Gordon, where are you? - Let's go! 
Up here, Gordon. 
Hurry up! 
Oh my God. 
- Woah, look at these. 
- Las Vegas auto show. 
We had VIP tickets for this. 
That's fantastic, let's go. 
Check the main bus for hydraulics, 
I'll balance the tanks. What? 
Okay, okay. 
I'm trying. 
Tower to Antonov, what the hell are you doing? Shut down immediately. 
- Caesar, shh. When I say" go" 
we push all this down at once, okay? - Okay. 
- Go! 
Antonov, abort take-off. 
You do not have clearance. 
I repeat, you must abort. 
What the hell was that? I don't know, but it's not good. 
- Push! - Pushing! 
Come on! 
We're going down! 
It must be the... Take over. 
What do you mean, take over? 
- Sasha! 
- Relax. Now! 
Jesus. 
- I think I got it 
- Sasha, now! 
- Take a deep breath. 
Pull! 
Was that the Eiffel Tower? 
I think so. 
Ladies and Gentlemen. We're on our way to China. Good. 
Very good. 
Do not believe in something simply because you have heard it, Nima. 
But great Lama. 
Tenzin is my brother. 
He works inside the big tunnel, where the ships are built. 
But what is there in your wisdom, great Lama, if Tenzin is right? 
What if our world is indeed coming to and end? 
It is full, great Rinpoche. 
Like this cup, you are full of opinions and speculations. 
To see the light of wisdom, 
You first must empty your cup. 
Be careful with the clutch... It tends to slip. 
Grandpa, Nima is here! Grandma, I got a message from Tenzin... 
He want us to meet him in Cho Ming at the work camp. 
He says he can get us onto the ships he's working on. 
What are you talking about? Tenzin works on the dam. 
Grandma the dam is a ship. 
There will be a big flood! We must pack up right away. 
Nima? 
Who gave you a truck? 
We took a trip on the Liam Song ferry once 
Let's eat first. 
Our father had one on order. 
He was supposed to get it next year. 
But then he canceled it. Because of the ships. 
How many cars does your family have? 
My mom's boyfriend has a Porsche. 
Our parents are divorced too. 
Found a hat. 
She has a thing for hats. 
I was just like that at her age. 
They made me feel safe. 
So, how did you meet Dr Silberman? 
As you can see not the same way you did. 
My boyfriend asked me to get them done 
We are not married. 
And probably never will be. 
They seem to like each other. Yeah, I guess. 
Tell me, Mr Karpov, how much did you pay? 
One billion Euro. 
Per seat. That's disgusting 
- Oh yeah? 
You know, Curtis, I wasn't always a businessman. 
Was my only playing when I was boy back in Murmansk. 
And my coach, his name was also Yuri. 
He always said : 
" If someone wants to beat you he has to kill you first" 
That's very nice. 
But tell me, what would you have done if you were rich like me? 
Look, they are wonderful children. 
OK guys. 
The plan is to refill in Hawaii, so sit down and buckle up. 
Gordon and I will do the rest. 
Oh God. 
Go get the guys. 
Guys, there's a... You might wanna... 
- The state of Hawaii 
Not good. 
That is not good. 
Not enough. 
We have to make a water landing 
Somewhere in South China sea. 
Great, at least we won't need a landing gear. 
- What about it? 
- We lost it all, in Vegas. 
I'm not very good company, I'm afraid. 
- Doctor... 
- Please, call me Adrian. 
All those people we left behind. They don't stand a chance, do they? 
I believe that nature will choose for itself, from itself, what will survive. 
Just like you, preserving those great artworks. 
Our culture is our soul, and that's not dying tonight. Come on, I contributed to this cover up. 
The Da Vinci, Picasso, they're in. 
But if you're some nobody you don't stand a chance. 
It's not necessarily true. 
Did you ever hear of a writer called Jackson Curtis? 
Wrote a book," Farewell Atlantis". 
What do you think the chances are of an unknown writer who barely sold 500 copies making it aboard this plane? 
- I don't understand 
- I mean call it chance or faith or nature, doesn't matter 
This book is part of our legacy now. 
Why? Because I'm reading it. 
Dr Helmsley, please report to the situation room. 
- Hello, I'm sorry. Who is this? 
This is Yoko Delgado. 
Do you want to speak to my daddy? 
Who should I say is calling? 
- Tell him, its his father. - You're my grandpa? 
Yes, sweetheart, I am. 
Daddy, grandpa is on the phone. 
Mr President, Sir. 
- She can't find her daddy. 
Why don't you two get comfy on that couch? 
I'll find your daddy. 
Sorry, man, I'm really busy right now. 
I mean of course, sir. 
Sorry, Mr President. 
- Don't worry about it, you're doing a great job, son. 
The Capitol has been hit by a 9.4 
Lost communication with the White House, sir. 
- Where is it centered? 
- North Chesapeake Bay. 
Mr Anheuser, Russian president on the line, sir. Excuse me. 
We just entered Chinese air space. 
That's affirmative, Mr President. 
I suppose I am in command. 
It appears that all other heads of state are en route, with the exception of the 
Italian Prime Minister, 
Who has also decided to stay behind and trust in prayer. 
Earths crust has begun to shift, Dr Helmsley! - By what degree? - 1.2 °. 
Still moving. 
So, what happens next? 
The movement of our land masses comes to a halt. 
Let's see a simulation. 
Expect the formation of gigantic tsunamis. 
Proportional to the magnitude of corresponding quakes. 
Yes, sir. 
My dad's on a cruise ship out there. 
But I guess you already knew that. 
Sir, we've recorded two underwater quakes at 7.9 and 8.2. 
From what we have just learned, Tokyo seems to have taken the full force of the earthquake. 
At this point unconfirmed reports indicate that large areas of land are under water. 
Please stay tuned for further... 
I called. 
I was too late. 
Maybe they got out of town. You never know. 
I'm coming home, Dorothy. 
Nothing but static. 
Not even an emergency signal. 
Can't think about what's going on down there 
Remember that old Beetle we used to camp in? But you'd never get the roof up. 
We definitely traded up. 
Tried to find our old spot at Yellowstone. When I went camping with the kids, but... 
I couldn't find it. 
Do you think people change? 
By people, do you mean me? Yes. 
Do you think you've changed since we separated? 
I seem to eat a lot more cereal now. 
You always had tunnel vision. 
You could just block everything out and write. 
You blocked us out. 
Do you love him? 
I love him enough. 
All global ground communication is ceased, sir. 
The only signals our satellites are picking up 
Well there's a piece of good news. 
Any updates, Doctor? 
We expect the tsunamis to reach land fall on every continent. 
The Cho Ming area will be impacted in approximately 6 hours. 
It looks like the crust have shifted by almost 23 degrees to the southwest. 
The data also shows the Earth's poles have reversed their magnetic fields. 
These are their new positions. 
You're telling me that the North Pole is now somewhere in Wisconsin? 
Actually, thats the South Pole now. 
Engine failure. 2 of 6 are down. 
You must get ready. 
- How long do we have? - 18 minutes. 
Maybe. 
Better wake up the kids. Da. 
Why do you hate Gordon? 
Hey. Come on. 
What are you talking about? 
I don't hate him. 
You don't like him either 
That's because I don't know him well, maybe. But I do. 
He's really nice once you get to know him. 
You should talk to him more often. 
You guys would get along really well. 
You like him a lot, huh? 
I'll do my best. I promise. 
OK? 
I'm really proud of you. Really proud of you. 
Is it time? 
Yeah 
Dad, what's wrong? Sasha's gotta land. 
It's gonna be a little bumpy. 
Maybe a little wet. 
Daddy? 
Hold her steady. 
Daddy, I'm not a really good swimmer. 
It's what you got this for. It's like being in a swimming pool. 
Only it's got more cool stuff. 
It's got a whistle, a light. I thought we were going to China. 
No, we gotta land here. 
So that's what we're gonna do. 
We're just gonna all stay together. No we're not, we're gonna die! 
No, we're not. 
Promise? 
I promise you, we'll all stay together, no matter what happens. 
Jackson, Yuri. 
I think you better come up here 
I'm gonna go check this out. 
- I'll be right back We gotta buckle up. 
Let's go. Don't ask me how that happened 
There is no more ocean, and we're pretty close to where we wanted to go. 
It's like the whole world shifted by 1000 miles. 1578 to be exact. 
It's called" Earth Crust Displacement Theory" 
Way to go, Charlie. 
What was that? 
We just lost our last two engines. 
I'll shoot for that glacier. 
It's going to get rocky. 
Listen, it's gonna sound crazy, but here's what you have to do. 
Get up! 
Follow me! 
Yuri, what are you doing? We are taking the Bentley! 
Not yet! 
Almost there. 
Get in the car. 
Okay, go now! 
No no no no no 
Go, Jackson. 
We gotta wait for Sasha and Gordon. 
Go! 
Make sure everybody gets off the plane before I touch down. 
What about you? 
I'll be fine. I have to touch this plane down. 
What are you waiting for? 
There he is. 
I see him! 
Come on lets go. 
- Where is Sasha? - He said he's fine 
We should get out of here before he touches down. 
Don't go! Go Jackson, go. 
It wont start. 
Shut up everybody! 
Engine 
Voice control. 
Welcome, to the People's Republic of China. 
- Good to be here. - Say hi, kids. 
Hi 
- What color are your passes? 
- What? What color are your boarding passes? 
I have green cards. 
- For my boys and me. - What? 
Yuri? 
Yuri! 
Yuri. 
It's a mistake. 
What? 
You think I didn't know about you and Sasha? 
May God bless that poor bastard's soul. 
I'm sorry guys. 
Good luck. 
Come on, boys. 
Maybe with money we could bribe them. 
You got a billion Euros? 
Dr Wilson. 
I'm Captain Michaels, Skipper of the American ship. 
Please accept my sincere condolences for your father. 
Thank you, Captain. 
Anheuser. Your party is the last to arrive. 
There's been reports of severe damage, Captain. 
What's the status of Ark number 3? 
We haven't done a complete assessment yet. 
Looks like we lost it. 
No toothbrush. 
Only books. 
When I was a kid my dad was on the road a lot. 
He'd always leave me a box full of books. 
I'd get an ice cream cone for every book I read so... 
I was a fat kid. 
I find that very hard to believe. 
No, its true, my high school carrier was 2000 books 
Zero girlfriends. 
I didn't even kiss a boy until I was in college. 
They were all too scared of my dad. 
Leave it to the Chinese. 
I didn't think it was possible. 
Not in the time we had. 
That's Ark number 3, sir. 
The roof collapsed during the shifting of the Earth's crust. 
Jesus Christ. 
Hey, what's going on here? 
I have a green card for my boys and me. 
I want to speak to your supervisor. 
I am the supervisor. 
Get back with the other green cards, or I'll have you detained. 
What he said about you and Sasha, is it true? 
Sasha was worth a hundred times a man like Yuri. 
I should have listened to you, Dr. Silberman. 
I actually liked the way I looked before that monster talked me into it. 
Did you know he asked me for a discount? 
He payed in installments. 
Cheap bastard. 
You hear that? 
Over there! 
Stop! 
Stop! 
How were all these people chosen? 
Same way your Arc was. 
By experts from all over the world. 
We had geneticists determine the perfect gene pool we need to repopulate. 
These people were chosen by geneticists? 
All green card holders 
Please proceed to hangar D-4 
Looks to me like their check books got them on board. 
That's right, Dr Wilson. 
Without billions of dollars from the private sector this entire operation 
We sold tickets? 
What about all these workers? 
They all get passes? 
What? 
Life isn't fair? 
Is that it? 
If you want to donate your passes, to a couple of Chinese workers, be my guest. 
Captain, I want a pre-launch briefing. 
All international teams present. 
What the hell? 
What is this? 
They could've fit 10 people in here. 
Satnam, where are you? 
- On the Nampan Plateau. 
- What? 
There's a tidal wave coming from the east. 
It's gigantic. 
Satnam, what happened? 
We never got picked up, Adrian. 
The airlift never came. 
Goodbye, my friend. 
Satnam 
- Where are we set up? 
Give me the satellite images from Napam, India. 
What's happening? 
Satnam was talking about another wave, coming from the east. 
- Holy mother of God. 
So the flooding will hit earlier? 
The second wave is closer? 
Plug in the new data. 
Satnam didn't get picked up. 
What? A lot of people didn't get picked up in this chaos. 
This is not a conspiracy, Helmsley. 
Your predictions haven't exactly panned out, have they, Doctor? 
It's ready. 
Oh God, its 1500 meters high. 
When will it get here? 
Talk to me, Hemsley, when will it hit? 
Adjust the countdown. 
28 minutes, 10 seconds to impact. 
My God. 
Captain. 
I need to speak to the other heads of state. 
- Right away. Taylor? 
- Aye, Captain 
Standing by. 
Ark 6, stand by. 
Ark 7, stand by. This is Carl Anheuser acting CIC on 4, 
Yes sir Requesting emergency conference T-99. 
He thinks the world of you, you know that? 
He's a great little man. 
Yeah 
I always wanted to have a family of my own. 
You're a lucky man, Jackson. 
Don't ever forget it. 
Who are they? 
We found them alongside of the road. 
Send them back! 
I am a follower of our great Lama Rinpoche. 
You know I cannot do that. 
You don't have to take all of us. 
Please just take my children. 
I'm begging you. 
Why should I do that? 
Same reason you sent for your family. 
Please just the children, you don't have to take us. 
Please! 
Please. Oh my God. 
Please. 
I don't know if you can understand what I'm saying. 
As a mother, I'm begging you. 
Please. 
We are all children of the Earth. 
My plan will not work for so many, Grandma. 
We will take them all. 
Attention. 
All construction workers. 
They're opening the mountain. 
They are leaving without us. 
Get back. 
What did I tell you! 
They are leaving you behind too. 
Please be patient 
Follow me. 
We have to hurry! 
They are leaving! 
Initiating security procedures. 
Excuse me. Where can I find Adrian Helmsley? 
He's on the bridge. 
This way. 
Tenzin wait! 
Grandma, we're almost there. 
Green lights on pressure, Mr Anton? 
Green lights across the board, Captain. 
Why do they have anchors? 
Because they're not space ships. They're Arcs. 
Let's go. 
Mr President. 
You've got to see this. 
Stop. 
Engage the support mechanisms. 
Aye-aye, Captain. 
Engaging supports. 
Just exactly how long are these things expected to hold us in place, Captain? 
They're just meant to withstand the first impact of the waves, Mr Anheuser. 
Down there Oleg, you go first. 
Caesar! 
Good boy. 
Come to Mommy. 
Caesar! 
Mommy, where's Tamara? 
Daddy look! 
Tamara! 
Oh my god, what's happening out there? 
Anheuser convinced the other heads of state to launch. 
Mr. Anheuser 
We have to stop this madness. 
Make sure the other bridges can see me. 
What do you think you're doing? 
I know exactly what I'm doing. 
Ladies and Gentleman, this is Dr. Adrian Helmsley 
Chief science adviser to the late President Wilson. 
Could you please turn up the volume, Mr Hoffman. 
I know we've all been forced to make difficult decisions to save our human civilization. 
But to be human means to care for each other and civilization means to work together to create a better life. 
If that's true, then there's nothing human and nothing civilized about what we're doing here. 
Dr. Helmsley's passion is admirable, 
But I remind you that we have very limited resources and extremely limited time. 
Ask yourselves, can we really stand by and watch these people die? 
I read a quote two days ago. 
The author is probably dead by now. 
But he said : " The moment we stop fighting for each other" 
" Thats the moment that we lose our humanity" 
And in order to save the human race, we have and obligation to stick to this plan which every nation on this flotilla signed up for. 
They're in God's hands now. 
Officer, you turn that off. 
That is an order, sailor. 
Turn it off! 
Don't you dare touch that button, young man! Have you completely lost your mind? 
Look at the clock! 
We have barely 15 minutes left! 
Do you want to be responsible for the extinction of the human race? 
Can you handle that, Adrian? 
There's a young astrophysicist from India who's the reason we are all here. 
Oh, for God's sake. He's the one who discovered it all. 
He connected all the dots, we all owe him our lives. 
I just learned that he was killed with his family in a Tsunami in eastern India. 
He was my friend. 
And he died in vain. 
Everybody out there has died in vain. 
If we start our future with an act of cruelty, what will you tell your children? 
If my father were here, he would open the gates 
The people of Russia along with... 
China and Japan 
Agree To open the gates! 
The United Kingdom, Spain, France and Germany, and I believe I may also speak for the 
Italian Prime Minister : We vote to let these people come in. 
Captain Michaels. 
Please 
This is your Captain. 
In a few moments, we will open the gates. 
Phew, it stinks. 
They are opening the gate. 
Come down! Noah. 
Move it! 
Noah! 
Mom, something happened. 
Come on, God damn it! 
Give me your hand! 
- Reach for it! 
Gordon! 
Stop! 
Climb! 
What's wrong with the gate? 
Looks like it didn't run the full cycle. 
We're checking it out. 
Order, please! 
4 minutes to impact 
We're all loaded, Captain. 
Then let's lock it up. 
Oleg! 
Grab my hand! 
No, no, no 
HYDRAULIC MALFUNCTION 
Something's jamming the hydraulics, Captain. 
Well then get it out for Christ sake. 
I can't fire up the engines until we get a good seal on that gate. 
Captain, we have a breach in the zoological bay. 
Can you zoom in? 
I know those kids. 
What is happening? 
What's going on? 
There. 
Through the hydraulic chamber. 
Captain, I think we found the problem! 
- Who are these people? 
- No, wait! He's injured. 
Something must've gone wrong. 
Are you kidding me? 
Of course something went wrong! 
Congratulations to the both of you. 
Might have gotten us all killed, but as long as your conscience is clean, right Helmsley? 
Captain, get an emergency team down there, 
I'll meet them at the hydraulics chamber. 
You know your way around here? 
Lets go! 1 minute to impact. 
Captain? Cho Ming airfield has been hit. 
Put me on emergency comm, Mr Taylor. 
This is the Captain speaking 
We expect to be impacted by water shortly. 
We need to go this way. 
All stations prepare for impact. 
Pressure just climbed 80 Pascal. 
Surface compression of valve sensors, Captain. 
Track Dr Helmsley. 
Out of the way! 
Excuse me. 
Tenzin. 
Almost there. Nima. 
Tamara! 
Will you take the kids please? 
Which way? 
We can't get there! 
Water is entering the stern. 
The rear of this ship is flooded and will seal up one compartment at a time. 
Where's Gordon? 
No? 
We gotta go back! We have to go back! 
Mommy! 
Help! 
Run! 
Go over, Lilly! 
Caesar! Lilly, take him! 
Mommy! 
Is there another way to the hydraulics chamber? 
Where does this ladder go? 
- To the zoological pens 
Professor? 
It's Air Force One. 
The mid-ship anchor support is hit. 
Can you stabilize it? 
The bow anchor is giving in. 
Captain, the turbines aren't responding. 
So override it. Hit the override. 
We cant start the engine until we close that gate. 
Help me! 
Momma! 
- Are you OK? 
- My mommy is in there. 
Please help her! 
We'll get to your mommy, sweetheart. They're doing everything they can, okay? 
Can we talk to her? 
I'm gonna try to connect us. 
We have to stop the bleeding! 
How about my belt? 
- Here Mom! - Mr. Curtis? 
Jackson? 
Help! 
Hey! 
It's Adrian Helmsley, we met at Yellowstone. 
Thats great. Open the God damn door! 
Your daughter is with me! 
- Lilly? - Where's Noah? 
I'm right here, Lil! 
Impact warning 30 ° West. 
45 ° East. 
Target elevation 29.035 feet. 
29.000 feet? What the hell is at 29.000 feet? 
We're headed straight for the north face of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser. 
And if we can't start our engines, we will not survive the impact. 
Jackson, you're sealed off! 
We can't get to you! There's something blocking the hydraulics 
If you can't get it out, none of us are gonna make it 
Dr Helmsley, look at this. 
It's completely submerged down there and there's no way for them to get any air. 
Theres no other way! But it's a suicide mission, sir! 
I know where it is, I'll give it a try. 
Dad, wait, I wanna go with you! 
- Dad, I wanna help you! 
- No, no, no. 
- You are helping me. 
- Dad, please! 
Remember when Lilly was born and you wanted to be introduced as her big brother? 
Well, she's scared now. 
She needs you more than ever. 
If you're safe, I know that she's safe. 
Do you understand? 
You can help me out the next time. 
We caused this thing, it was us. 
I gotta go check it out. 
Can you hear me? 
No 
Press down! 
Press down with your hand! 
Don't stop. 
Keep pressing! 
No! 
Distance to impact : 
1.850 meters 
There he is! 
- Captain! 
- We have a visual! 
I think we found the problem. 
Show us the hydraulics chamber 
God dammit! 
I told you to stay up there! 
I just wanted to help. 
We're right under the air pocket, okay? 
How did you know I needed help? 
Grandpa, Grandma... 
I'm sorry. I could not save us 
He has gone back in. 
He will fix it. 
There's no way. 
Don't lose faith, brother. 
Dad! 
We're gonna die! 
Great job! 
You light the way and I'll go for the cable. 
Distance to impact : 
400 meters 
Underwater ridge ahead! 
We're going to run aground, Captain! 
Sir, the gate is sealed! 
That's affirmative, Captain! 
- Anton, start the engines. 
- Aye-aye Captain. 
Full reverse. 
Captain! 
We're not gonna make it! 
Distance to impact : 
15 meters. 
Reverse motion activated 
Distance to impact : 
10 meters. 
20 meters. 
Hard to port! 
We did it! 
We did it! 
- Where's Dad? 
- He was right behind me 
Any word from the hydraulic chamber? 
Where is he? 
I thought you said he was right behind you. 
He was! - Are you sure? 
- Yes. 
He was right there! 
Dad. 
Dad! 
Come on, Jackson. 
Come on. 
Please, please. 
Please, please. 
He did it! 
He did it! 
DAY 27 MONTH 01 YEAR 0001 
Shuttle Atlantis. 
Our last day. 
All we can hear is the sound of our own breathing. 
That reminds us we are still sharing our memories, hopes and ideas. 
And isn't it funny? 
Just this morning we worked it out 
Somehow or another, we all have relatives in Wisconsin. 
The end. 
It's good. 
I thought you would like it. 
Tell me Dr Wilson : Apart from books and art. 
Do you think there's anything else we might possibly share? 
In the future? 
Are you asking me out on a date, Dr. Helmsley? 
You know my diary is pretty full. 
Actually... 
Yes, I was. 
Dr. Helmsley to the bridge, please. 
Dr. Helmsley to the bridge. 
Come here. 
Ladies and gentleman, this is captain Michaels speaking. 
In a few minutes I will give orders to unseal the decks. 
At 23 : 45 last night, our sister Arks number 6 and 7 have joined our course. 
For the first time on our journey, we will have clear skies. 
As you know our passenger count is way over capacity. 
So please, be careful when you step out and of course... 
enjoy the fresh air. 
Can I hold him? 
Sure, he can be your dog too if you like. 
Thanks. 
Where have you been all my life? 
Gift shop. 
Oh, Adrian. 
Excellent. 
I called because we just got our first satellite feet. 
The equalization of the oceanic... seabeds has not turned out to be as extreme as we expected. 
The waters are receding. 
Much faster than we thought. Thank God. 
And... 
This is hard to believe, but the Himalayas are no longer the roof of the world. 
It's now the Drakensberg mountains of KwaZulu, Nepal. 
The entire African continent has just risen 7.000 feet, and unlikely they are even flooded. 
That's why they call it The Cape of Good Hope. 
We've already set course for it. 
Daddy, when will we go back home? 
Well, we talked about that. 
We're gonna find a new home out here somewhere. Right? 
Wherever we're all together. 
Nice. 
You having fun, sweetheart? Yes. 
Ahh. 
Well, I hope you're doing better than me, baby. 
- What are you making? - A necklace for Mom. 
Yeah? Let me see. 
Another one? 
- Yes. 
- Honey? That's two today. 
Honey? 
- Yeah? - Waiting for the help to get that? 
I thought you and I were the help. 
- Go wash up for dinner, pumpkin. - Okay. 
Mmm, smells nice. That takeout? 
No! 
You can't fight fate. 
No! 
Fucking stop! Let's go! Just shut the fuck up! 
It's cool. 
Kids like me. No! 
- Nick. 
- Bray, what's happenin'? 
Willis is a rowing buddy of mine. Where are we on his kid's case? 
- Willis? - Yeah. - Oh, I kicked it down to juvie. 
- Why did you do that? 
'Cause the case was a dog. The kid was only 15 years old when he committed the murder. 
You wouldn't want to jeopardize your 95 % conviction rate. 
- It's actually 96 %. - 96 % now? Yes. 
You know, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you were gunning for my job. 
You do know better. And you know that I'm aiming much higher than that. 
They filed a motion to dismiss, but there's no way that Judge Abrams honors it. I think that we can get him on RICO. 
All that time and that's what you come back with, Sarah? 
You might want to reevaluate your research skills. 
- What else have we got? - She's right. 
Mr. Rice? RICO's designed for this kind of thing. 
Check out section 901 of the Organized Crime Control Act. And you should let Sarah try this case too. 
Mr. Rice, last I checked, I was running this room. 
She's already done the leg-work. 
I'll oversee it. I mean, Helen Keller could try this case. 
Okay, Boy Wonder, she fucks up, it's on you. 
Cantrell wants to see you. 
All right, I'll be right there. 
No, Nick. 
He wants to see Nick. 
You still torturing Bringham? 
Let's just say I'm less impressed with his Harvard degree than he is. 
Well, we can't all have gone to Fordham. 
I went to Fordham night school. 
You know what I learned in Fordham night school? Law school's got nothing to do with law. 
Guess you skipped the course on inter-office politics. 
All I need is a jury to like me. Isn't that what you told me, Jonas? 
The Shelton case - where are we? 
It went sideways last night - Judge Burch. Ahh. 
Bad news. 
What now? 
- Let's make the deal. 
- They killed a little girl, Nick. 
- It's an imperfect system. 
- And we its imperfect servants. 
- However you could win this case. 
- No, can't take that chance. 
Some justice is better than no justice at all. 
You need to tell the husband. 
Okay. That's part of my job. 
Good, because he's waiting for you right now. 
What? 
- How are you doing? - Good. 
How are you doing? 
Good. Sit. 
Sit. 
Well, I didn't hear back from you and made some notes on the case. 
I had some good ideas. 
Yeah, let me take a look at it. Well, they're just - 
I was gonna talk to you about those. 
Do you trust me? 
Do you trust me, Clyde? 
Yeah, of course. 
Darby has agreed to testify against Ames. 
With Darby's testimony, Ames will go to death row. 
Um, what about - what about Darby then? 
Darby will plead guilty to murder. 
- In what degree? 
Five years... at best? 
I don't understand. I'm sorry. 
We had a setback. The judge ruled that the DNA was inadmissible. - What? 
- Exclusionary rule. The opposing counsel maneuvered it. 
You said this part of the case was clear-cut. 
We had the blood on his shirt - 
It's covered under the same rule. 
What about the rest of the forensic evidence? 
It's not conclusive, Clyde. 
Okay, that's okay. 'Cause I saw - I saw their faces. 
I saw them do it. I mean, he killed my little girl, Nick. 
You blacked out, Clyde. Your testimony won't be reliable. You get on the stand and the defense will tear you apart. 
No no, the jury's gonna believe me though. 
- Because it's the truth! 
We can - - We can lose. And then we'd have nothing. 
You will waste a whole year, spend millions of dollars, and then both of them could end up going free. 
Nick, both of them are guilty, especially Darby! 
- You know that. - It's not what you know, Clyde. It's what you can prove in court. 
Please don't make a deal with this man. 
Please don't make a deal with this man. He's a monster - 
I'm sorry, the deal is done. I'm sorry. I made the deal. 
How could you do that? 
This is just how the justice system works. 
Listen, I know you don't think it right now, but this is a victory for us. 
Your office has certified this agreement? 
Yes, Your Honor. 
Mr. Reynolds, any great insights to share with the court today? 
I'm a defense attorney, Your Honor. I don't have many of those. 
No, Your Honor. No insights. 
Good, then I trust that we can move forward with Mr. Ames's trial unimpeded by continuances. A trial date is imminent. 
Yeah? There's no cell phones in my courtroom, Mr. Rice. 
- We've been over this - - I'm sorry. 
- and over this, over this... 
Yeah, I had some exigent business I - 
Next time it's mine. 
- Ah, you married? 
- Excuse me? 
Are you married? 
Please fuck this up so I can destroy you. 
I wish ill for no man, but Ames deserves to suffer for what he did. 
I mean, you can't fight fate, right? 
Once you make a decision, live with it - move on. 
This job, your best asset's a short memory. 
Don't beat yourself up. Too many other people out there doing that already. Look, there's some of them right now. 
Isn't this where you tell me some type of old fable or wives' tale - 
All right, all right, I got one. 
Marcus Aurelius hired a servant to walk behind him as he made his way through the Roman town square. 
And this servant's only job was to whisper in his ear when people praised him, 
" You're only a man. 
You're only a man." - Okay, man? - Okay, man. 
- Okay, man. - That's some bullshit. 
That's good. I don't think you even know what that story means. 
You're missing the point, Nick. It doesn't matter what they say. 
Okay, I got this now. 
All right, ladies and gentlemen, one at a time, one at a time. 
So you'll be seeking the death penalty? 
- For Rupert Ames, we will be. 
- And for Darby? 
He has pled guilty to murder, but he is a cooperating witness. 
The DA's office has committed all of its resources to ensure that justice will be served. 
I just wanted to say thanks for being in my corner. 
It's nice when the system works, right? 
Get away from me. 
Move. Move. 
Let's go. 
Nuh-uh, what happened? 
What happened to what? 
What's wrong? 
You call my job boring." C -"? 
Yes. 
Well... okay now... you gonna tell me what's wrong? 
Can I talk to my daughter for a little bit? - Oh, please. No no no. 
- Gonna lay down. 
Please? 
First of all, this is your father speaking. 
- Yeah, she didn't know that. 
- You never know. 
I want you to stay in there as long as you can. 'cause there's a lot of crazy-ass people out here. 
Language. 
Your mother's a hardass, but - 
I'm right here. And Daddy 
- Daddy wants you to come out and be Daddy's little girl. 
I want her to come out'cause she's on my bladder. 
Ahh! 
Anybody seen my phone? 
- Hey, have you seen my phone? 
- It's not strapped to your hand? No, it's not strapped to my hand. 
- Daddy? - Yeah? You're not gonna have some of my French toast? 
- French toast? You made French toast? - Mm-hmm. 
I can't, honey. I'm running late. Okay. 
All right, here 
- Mmm. - Mmm, that's good. - Thank you. 
- You did this by yourself? - Mm-hmm. 
I'm just gonna take this whole plate to work. 
All right - no. 
You're only 10 years old? 
- You better than your mother. - I heard that. 
Smells good in here. 
'Morning, baby. Give me a kiss. Mmm! 
You going to your daughter's recital this afternoon? 
Um, I thought you were gonna order the DVDs. 
Video's not the same, Nick. 
Mom, it's okay. Dad's got to work, I know. 
See? It's all right. Dad's got to work. 
And what is Dad doing today? - Lock up bad guys. 
- And why does he do that? 
- To keep us safe. 
- Yeah. She understands. 
'Cause he wants us to be safe. 
- Baby, get your cello. - All right. 
- Thank you so much. - You're welcome. 
- Little Julia Child. 
You know she's 10 years old, right? 
- You know that? 
- I know that. She doesn't understand why you're never around. This good-guy, bad-guy stuff - that's just talk to her. 
Don't do this, come on. I can't come today. 
You know you have not been to one recital - 
- How many has she had? - Enough. Okay. 
Well, we'll get the video, we'll sit down and we'll watch it together as a family. 
I love you. All right? 
- Thank you for the toast. 
- Love you too! - Bye. Love you. 
Huh. - So how's Chip? 
- It's Chester. 
What happened to Chip? I liked Chip. 
There is no Chip. 
And now there's no Chester. He kept calling. 
- Sarah, that's a good thing. 
- I know, but I kept cancelling. My caseload's crazy. 
You know you don't have to go to this if you don't want to. 
Yeah, I do. I... 
What's it like? No biggie. 
Like watching somebody fall asleep. Except for the not-waking-up part. 
Does it bother you? 
Not anymore. 
Sarah, your legs are looking real good in those heels. 
Fuck off. 
What are you doing here, Reynolds? 
Your DVD player broken? 
Ames has no family. I felt like someone should be here for him. 
Wow, that's nice. 
Breathe. 
Rupert Ames, do you have anything you want to say? 
Yeah. 
What I did that night was wrong. 
I should have never been there. 
But I swear to God, I didn't kill those people. The wrong man's dying here today. 
The wrong man's dying. 
That's all. 
Look at me. 
Fuck! 
Fuck! Oh, God. 
- Oh, God. - Take her - take her out. 
- What the hell is going on? - I don't know. 
You okay? Huh? 
Yeah. 
So somebody killed the guy you were trying to kill? 
What are we calling this? 
Clear violation of his Eighth Amendment rights cruel and unusual punishment. 
- Law school. Yeah. 
The machine - how does it work on a good day? 
It's designed to be pain-free. 
It's three drugs administered in a specific order. 
From this point on, we're operating under the assumption that the machine was corrupted. 
We're gonna need a list of all the people with access to that machine. 
- My people would not do this. 
- I appreciate that, Warden, but I'm gonna need more than a hall pass and a note from Mom. 
Detectives, got this off the back of the machine. - Check it out. 
- Let me see it. Right there. 
" Can't fight fate." 
What is it, Nick? 
During the home invasion, Ames's accomplice said to one of the vics," You can't fight fate." 
And then he said the same thing to me in the courtroom - prick. 
I can't remember his name, though. 
Have a look at this - your guy? 
Clarence James Darby. 
- He's a cutie. - You got history with him? 
- Put him away. 
All right, three years. That the going rate for murder these days? 
There was extenuating circumstances. 
The only extenuating circumstances should be he didn't do it. 
Still, three years at Marion? Fucking gladiator academy. You expect him to come back a model citizen? 
Well, if you scholars wouldn't contaminate the crime scenes, I could keep them locked up longer. 
Authorities have refused to comment at this point, but foul play cannot be ruled out. 
The prisoner had been on death row for the past 10 years - his name, Rupert Ames. 
All we know at this point is what was supposed to be a painless execution has turned into something out of a horror film. 
Yeah? 
- Clarence Darby? 
- Who's this? That's strike three for you : coke on the table, bitch on the floor - life in prison. 
Who the fuck is this? 
Look out your window, south side. 
- Is this a joke? Get up! 
- Ahh! 
South side. 
Motherfucker. 
Out of the way! 
- You're all crazy! He's heading north! 
Go go! 
- Damn. 
- Move it, move it. Go on! 
- What now? 
- Wipe the prints off the gun. 
You fired six times, genius. 
You bring any ammunition? 
- Lose it. - Why are you doing this? 
I want to keep you out of prison. 
See the abandoned factories? 
Go toward them. 
Why? There's a cop car there with a cop in it. 
What the fuck? 
I Tasered him, but he'll be waking up in about 90 seconds, so you'd better move. 
Rise and fucking shine, bitch. Wake the fuck up! Let's go! 
Start the fucking car! - Okay! - Do it. 
- Take it easy, take it - - Come on! 
- Okay, let's go. - Take it easy. Let's go! 
Get in gear, shithead, now! Do it! 
Get the fuck out. 
Let's go. 
Get the fuck down there! 
Okay. What about my wife? 
- I'll never see them again. 
- Fucked up, ain't it? 
Oh oh oh. You don't mind if I take this, do you? 
My guardian angel. I am impressed. 
You know why I'll never see my wife and little girl again? 
'Cause you took' em from me. 
You remember me? 
Sure you do. 
You came over to my house once before. 
You don't remember? 
This tetrodotoxin... should be nicely into your system by now. 
It's isolated from the liver of a Caribbean puffer fish. 
So it paralyzes you, but leaves all the other neurological functions perfectly intact. 
In other words, you can't move... but you feel everything. 
It does absolutely nothing to blunt the pain. 
And you're about to experience more of that than you could ever fucking imagine. 
These are tourniquets so you don't bleed out,'cause you may be here a while. 
Saline solution - that should keep us going. 
Clamps - nice and secure. 
Comfortable? 
You really are shaking. 
Sure you're all right? 
You'll love this - adrenaline. 
Now this is so you don't pass out. 
There you go. How's that feel? 
Good? 
Now what we don't want is you swallowing your tongue, so bear with me. 
Now this is for your penis, but we'll get to that later. 
Scalpel... for your eyelids, in case you insist on fucking shutting them. 
You see, I know what it feels like to be helpless. 
just like when I watched you slaughter my whole family. 
You know you can't fight fate, right, Darby? 
Oh! 
And look - I made this especially for you. 
You like it? 
Yeah, I didn't want you to miss anything. 
Now you have the best view in the house. 
You hear that? 
Your heart is beating so fast. 
No, me too. Okay. 
Now they get to watch you suffer. 
They'll be the last thing you ever see as I cut off every single one of your fucking limbs. 
See, I wasn't lying when I told you that I wanted to keep you out of prison. 
That was the truth. 
Thanks for the car. 
Okay, these are all the case files on Darby. 
I vetted through what I could. We have crime-scene photos - 
Don't need to see' em. 
Okay. 
- What's bothering you? 
- It's Darby. 
All the crimes he's committed have one thing in common, and that was violence. But yesterday at that execution, 
- that wasn't violence. That was - - What? 
- What are you thinking? - I don't know. 
I'm just thinking maybe we shouldn't be looking for Darby. 
Jesus Christ. 
Rice. Good news, Counselor. 
We found Darby. 
I gotta say though, he's looked better. 
They found him in about 25 pieces : 
no legs, no arms, eyelids were sliced off - gruesome. 
Shedding tears for Darby? 
- Not quite. 
I see your wheels turning. 
Think motive - who has one? 
The husband, the father. What do we know about him? 
He owned the warehouse where they found Darby. 
- What else? 
- He's a tinkerer - uh, little inventions, gizmos. 
He holds two dozen patents that made him some money. 
He liquidated most of his wealth a few years ago to buy some industrial properties around airports, chemical plants, rail yards. 
- It doesn't add up. 
- No, it's weird, right? 
Search' em all, Sarah. See what you find. 
Freeze! 
- Get down, go! - On your knees! 
- Face down, face down! - Pull him down and cuff him! 
Crazy men scare the shit out of me. 
Is this guy a lawyer? 
No. 
He's an engineer. 
Nick, look at this. 
We have zero evidence. 
Gonna need a confession. 
He give you any trouble on the way in? 
No, nothing. 
He wasn't too happy when we took his bracelet, though. 
- Can I help you? 
- Package for the Rice family. 
Oh, yeah. Thanks. 
Mom, the video from my recital came. 
Can we watch it? - Please? 
- No, not you. 
No, please, we said we were gonna wait for your father, remember? 
- Please? 
- No, not now. 
Mommy! 
Don't worry, he's just disarming the guy, letting him feel easy. 
What I'm about to tell you I don't want anybody else to hear. 
As a prosecutor, I'm breaking all the rules right now, and I don't give a damn because I'm a father. 
I have a little girl. 
And what you did... bravo. 
The world is better without Darby and Ames. 
You're not gonna see a tear shed from me or anybody in my office. 
With that being said... I have a job to do. 
I'm gonna ask you some very simple and direct questions. I suggest that you answer them in the same fashion. 
Is your name Clyde Alexander Shelton? 
Yes, sir. 
And you've waived your right to counsel, correct? 
- Yes, sir. 
- You sure you want to do that? Yes. 
Did you murder Clarence Darby? 
I wanted him dead. 
He killed my wife and child. 
Rupert Ames - did you murder him as well? 
Rupert Ames deserved to die. 
They both deserved to die. 
So you arranged both of those murders? 
Yes, I planned it... in my head, over and over again. It took me a long time. 
All right. I guess we're done here. 
Counselor? 
You might want to cancel your 12 : 30 lunch with Judge Roberts. 
Excuse me? 
In fact, you might want to cancel the rest of the week,'cause you're gonna be busy. Sit down. 
We're done here. We have your confession. Mmm. 
Oh, you do? 
On tape. 
See, in our profession, we consider that a slam-dunk. 
Oh, really? I don't think so. Let's think back. 
What did I say? That I wanted to kill Clarence Darby? 
Yeah, sure. What father wouldn't? 
That both Darby and Ames deserved to die? 
I think most people would agree with that. 
That I planned it over and over again in my head? 
Yeah. Who wouldn't fantasize about that? 
None of these are an admission of guilt, Nick. 
- You might want to check the tape. 
- We know you did it. 
Well, it's not what you know, it's what you can prove in court. Didn't you tell me that once? 
The only problem with your theory is that Darby's body was found on your property. 
One of my many properties - an old abandoned warehouse, Nick. 
Junkies, they trespass there all the time. 
Isn't Darby involved in the drug trade? 
That's an unsavory world. I bet you a jury would agree. Or perhaps someone was trying to frame me. 
You know, Clyde, there's a lot of assholes in prison that thought they were smarter than me. 
Let's stop fucking around. 
Nick, unless you have any hard evidence, then why are we even here? 
Why are we having this - 
- What do you want? 
Well, that's easy. 
Now you're the one who makes deals with murderers, yeah? 
So I've come to make mine. 
I will give you a confession, a real confession. You just have to give me something in return. 
Yeah, well, since you are a murderer, what might that be? 
A bed. 
But a nice bed. 
I want a nice new one for my cell. 
Very simple. 
You're gonna have to deal with that, because the one I have is lumpy, Nick. It's making me crazy. 
Clyde, I think you've got me confused with detail people. See, I don't deal with prison conditions. 
I believe those cots are bolted into the cells. 
Well, that's what wrenches are for, dumbass. 
You know, one of those new Duxiana beds with the adjustable - you know, adjustable lumbar support, 
- that's the one. - I've seen the commercial. 
- That's the one I want. - Those are nice. 
-' Cause really - - Comes on late at night. - And frankly I don't think - 
- I'll be able to focus on anything until I've had a good revitalizing night's sleep in my therapeutic Duxiana bed. 
So that's the deal : 
you get me my bed, you get your confession. 
Okay, let me think about that for a second. 
How about... fuck no. 
Hey, what are you doing? - What do you mean? 
- Why did you tell him no? 
A mattress? He doesn't make those kinds of decisions. 
Take your ego out of it, Nick. 
Shelton's got a point : this case is shit. 
We need a confession. And a mattress for a murder confession? - That's a pretty good deal. 
- He's playing us, Jonas. 
Well, then we will play him. 
Nick? There's an urgent call from your office. They say you're not answering your cell. 
I need to finish up here and then I will be home as soon as I can. Listen to me : 
the things on this video - Nick, I have never seen anything like it. Please come home. 
Listen, you need to calm down. Tell her that it's not real... - Okay. 
-... and that I love her. Come home. Come home soon, please. 
- Kelly, did you see his face? - No. 
It was covered with something. I couldn't see. 
Okay, baby, let me finish up here and I'll come home as fast as I can, okay? 
Okay. This motherfucker sent a DVD to my house of him killing Darby. - What? 
- My daughter saw it. 
He recorded it? We've got him. 
No no, he had on a mask. 
We need that confession. 
You still want to bargain with this man? 
The art of the possible, Warden. 
Make the deal. 
Back problems, Warden - the worst. 
You got bigger problems than that. 
It's the have-nots in here, son. 
I don't know that I want to be the one" have." 
Turn around. 
I don't think he likes me. 
Nice bed. 
Thank you. 
It's a single. 
I'd watch my fucking back around here, you hear? 
In the cell, let's go. 
We can't put Clyde Shelton anywhere - not in a job, not in a city, not even the country. So I dug a little deeper and I found something from his missing years : 
a couple of contract payments to Clyde from the Department of Defense. 
- And his real estate? 
- He bought nine properties under his own name, then he transferred them to some corporation in Panama. 
We can't get to the addresses. A lack of reciprocity is our problem. So I'm gonna circle back to the farmhouse. 
That's a waste of time. He wanted us to find it and find him there. 
It's the industrial stuff that's curious. 
All right, I don't care what you have to do and who you have to piss off. If we have to invade Panama again, fine. 
Clyde is hiding those properties for a reason. Find him. 
Got it. 
- Baby, you leave it cracked? - Hmm? 
Yeah, I left it cracked. 
- Night light? - Isn't she too old for a night light? 
Yeah, I left a night light. 
- Good. - Look, I told her that that video wasn't real. 
- Okay, good. - She'll be okay. Yeah. 
And you? 
- Am I what? Okay? - Yeah. 
Of course. Don't I look okay? - Hmm? 
Nick is always okay. 
Always - I'm extra good. 
I love you. 
I love you too. 
In light of Mr. Shelton's economic means and his potential flight risk, the egregious nature of both Mr. Ames's and Mr. Darby's deaths, the state requests that bail be denied, Your Honor. 
Seeing as how you've... waived your right to counsel, Mr. Shelton, do you have anything to say? 
Mr. Shelton? 
Do you have anything that you'd like to say, Mr. Shelton? 
Yes yes yes, Your Honor. 
- Should I stand? 
- Please. 
Your Honor, I'm a law-abiding citizen. 
I'm just a regular guy. 
I am not a flight risk. And this is my first alleged offense. 
And the prosecution has not presented one single piece of evidence against me. 
Now in these circumstances, unless the state has obtained some new piece of information relating to my involvement in the matter in question, then I find it highly prejudicial, even constitutionally offensive, to keep me detained without bail. 
It's a slippery slope, Your Honor. 
Haven't we seen the result of such violations, both internationally and domestically? 
I am actually inclined to agree with you, Mr. Shelton. 
Your Honor, Mr. Shelton has agreed to give us a full confession. 
Has he given it, Mr. Rice? 
No, Your Honor. 
Well, then in my opinion, the state has failed to establish a compelling basis for its motion, and I will grant bail in the amount of - 
Your Honor, I would caution you not to do that. 
Thank you. 
Excuse me? 
No, I don't think I will excuse you. 
You see, this is what I'm talking about. 
You were about to let me go. Are you kidding me? 
This is why we're here in the first place. 
You think I don't remember who you are, lady? 
I would tread carefully, Mr. Shelton. 
Well, how carefully should I tread? 
Because apparently I just killed two people, and you were about to let me walk right out that door! 
How misguided are you? 
I feed you a couple of bullshit legal precedents, and there you go - you jump on it like a bitch in heat. 
- Folks, you all hang out - - I'm warning you, Mr. Shelton! 
- - in the same little club. 
- You will be held in contempt! And every day you let madmen and murderers back on the street. - You're too busy treating the law - 
- - like it's a fucking assembly line! - One more time. - Do you have any idea what justice is? 
- You are now - - Whatever happened to right and wrong? - - in contempt of court. 
- Whatever happened to right and wrong? 
- Remove this man. - Whatever happened to the people? 
- Bail denied! 
- Whatever happened to justice? 
- Bail denied! And I bet you take it up the fucking ass, bitch. 
Bailiff. Hey, see you later, Nick. 
Insanity? 
That's what you're building your defense on? Insanity? 
Nick, I told you I would give you a confession. And I 
- I meant it. - I saw a movie today. 
- You did? My daughter saw the same movie. 
Well, you taught your daughter about good versus evil? 
I don't have to. 
Well, that's what this movie was about : 
good conquering evil, the righteous prospering, the wicked suffering. 
I didn't get that. 
I'm gonna give you one more chance, Clyde. 
And don't test me'cause I will run you over. 
Fair enough. 
You did get me my bed. 
A deal's a deal. 
That was you on video killing Clarence Darby, wasn't it? 
Yes, that was me. 
Okay, fair enough. That was me, Clyde Shelton, on the video, killing Clarence Darby. 
Not good enough, Clyde. I need specifics. 
I took his fingers with bolt cutters, his toes with tin snips, his balls with a hacksaw, and his penis with a box cutter. 
How's that for specifics? 
And Ames? 
Switching the canisters was easy. 
Everything's automated these days, so I just hacked into the shipping company's server and swapped a few numbers around so the package came to me. 
Then I switched the potassium chloride with something a little more... deliberate. 
Well, I'm tired of hearing your bullshit. 
I got everything I need. 
What now? 
you go to prison. You know, the righteous prospering, the wicked suffering. 
That ought to make you feel better about the system. 
What if I had another confession to make? 
Call a priest. 
But another confession would mean another deal, Nick, so you would have to give me something in return. 
You ever been to Del Frisco's? 
They cater. 
So for lunch, I would love a 20oz porterhouse steak, medium, maybe a little bit charred, with all the trimmings - pommes frites, asparagus, butter squash. 
Fuck you and your pommes frites. 
I'll tell you what : can I have my iPod as well? 
I'd love a little bit of music with my meal. 
First rule of negotiating, Clyde : you gotta have something to bargain with. 
Would the life of Bill Reynolds suffice? 
Open it. 
Who the fuck is Bill Reynolds? 
Darby's attorney. 
Tell me you located him. 
I've got his wife. She reported him missing three days ago. 
Thank you, Mrs. Reynolds. 
Well, looks like I got something to bargain with after all, Nick. 
At the moment, Bill Reynolds is still alive. 
I'll tell you exactly where he is. 
Just bring me my meal and my music at 1 : 00 exactly. 00 sharp. 
00, Nick. 
That's good, right there. 
- It's 5 to 1 : 00. 
- I don't take orders from him or you. 
And inmates don't have access to the time. 
- We tell them what time it is. - I don't care if he has a Rolex or not. We need to stick to the timeline that was agreed to. 
Fuck him, Nick. 
Let him wait. 
Christ, he sawed a guy's dick off. Whether you like it or not, we are on his time. 
Check it again. 
Steamed asparagus, 
- lobster macaroni and cheese... - Wow. 
... porterhouse steak, seared, medium rare. 
Hmm. - Napkin, Nick. - Napkin. 
Oh, excuse me, waiter? 
You might want to put 30 % down for yourself, my man. 
- Hey, what time is it? 
Is that right, Nick? 
- It's 1 : 08. - That's disappointing, Warden. 
I mean, how can you expect me not to fuck with you when you can't even be honest with me? 
Late or not, Clyde, you have what you asked for. Now where's Reynolds? 
Can I have some silverware, gentlemen? 
Silverware. You get a spork. 
Thanks. 
Come on, Clyde. 
Okay. Here we go : 
39N57'... 04", 
075W10' 22". 
And you'd better hurry, Nick. 
'Cause by anybody's watch but the warden's, you're already late. 
- Open the door! - Where's my lunch? 
I'll take a ground unit! 
So I suppose if I don't share this with you, you're gonna - 
I'm gonna get the fuck up, 
I'm gonna cock back my right hand, and I'm gonna split your whole fucking skull in two. How about that? 
Well, come on over here. Join me. There's plenty to go around. 
Here, enjoy. Have some pasta. It's good. 
What about some steak? 
You want steak? - Mmm. - Here, have some steak. 
Here's a big piece for you. There you go. 
Good, huh? 
What'd you do to get in here, anyways? 
I did what I had to do. 
So you got a girl or something? 
Mmm, it's a long story. 
Pilot, how much longer? 
Two minutes. 
How about you? 
You have a girl? - Got a few girls back home. - Oh, yeah? 
Yeah. - You have a boyfriend in here or no? 
This is - it's Reynolds's. 
- Not a good sign, Nick. - Just dig. 
- Jesus Christ! 
- Reynolds! 
- Reynolds! He's gone, Nick. He's gone. 
- Oxygen? - Get something to get him out! 
He's got IV lines going to his - 
He's got him cuffed! 
Listen, you got your keys to the cuffs? 
Oh, God, I'm so happy. Your lucky day, huh? 
Get some food. Here, wanna take a shot at this? 
- What is it? - Know how to use it? 
No. 
Oh, shit! Check this out! 
He's crazy! 
Don't stop now, partner! 
Finish him, come on! 
I need a shower, Warden. 
Get him out of there! 
Dunnigan, what time do you have? 
37. 
Took us roughly 15 minutes to get here. 
Yeah? Reynolds's air was rigged to shut off at 1 : 15. 
If Shelton would have got his lunch on time, he'd still be alive. 
Fuck this guy, Nick. He wants to play games, we can play games too. 
We need to take the gloves off. 
Nick, it's Sarah. Listen, Clyde murdered his cell-mate. 
The warden is furious. He's moving him to solitary. 
That's all I know right now. 
How are we doing? 
Great. 
Can you believe this? Checking his iPod for clues. 
I do the same thing with my daughter's. 
Learn anything? 
Yeah, they both got shit taste in music. 
We got a game plan with this guy or what? 
I tell you, I got a game plan. 
Give me five minutes alone with him and I'll cripple the fucker. I don't give a shit what happened to his family. 
It's no excuse. 
Stop right there. 
Step into the cell. 
We found Reynolds. 
Moments too late, from what I hear. 
I had to call his wife and tell her that her husband had been buried alive. 
Justice should be harsh, Nick, but especially for those who denied it to others. 
And your cell-mate? What was that about? 
You murdered a man because your lunch was late. 
No, you murdered him because you couldn't keep your word. 
We made a deal, you and I : 
1 : 00 PM. That's a pretty important principle I'd like you start learning, Nick : 
- keeping your word. - Oh, really? 
What principle was at work when you tortured and killed those people? 
That everyone must be held accountable for their actions. 
You think your wife and daughter would feel good about you killing in their name? 
My wife and daughter can't feel anything. 
They're dead. 
Hey, Nick? On Clyde's real estate, Judge Stansfield shut us down. 
He's looking for some sort of legal precedent that I'm not sure exists. 
- But? - But... I think I may have found a way around it. 
- I'll call in a favor from a friend. 
- Who's your friend? You don't name your friends or they stop doing you favors. 
Something else Cantrell said. 
No, that was all you. 
Jonas, hi. 
She's thinking just like you, Nick. 
Guess you trained her well. 
- One day she'll have my job. 
- Let's get some air. 
Clyde's government contract payments were bothering me, so I pulled some ancient strings. 
We're meeting someone. Who might that be? 
Someone who does some really nasty shit so we can live the American dream. 
So Clyde finally lost it? 
Somebody must have really pissed him off. 
You worked with Shelton, is that right? 
Okay, first of all, I was never here and we never spoke. 
Tell us what we're dealing with. 
Shelton was a spy or - Spies are a dime a dozen. 
I'm a spy. Clyde is a brain. He's a think-tank type guy. 
His specialty was low-impact kinetic operations. 
Is this a hell of a fancy way to say that he kills people? 
We kill people. He figured out how to do it without ever being in the same room. 
It was his gift, and he was the best. 
One time we're tasking this tricky target. 
I mean, we're using cruise missiles and predators and we even had a B-2 bomber flatten this guy's villa with a JDAM. 
All right? We're burning up millions in ordnance and we're getting nowhere with this guy. 
So we call Clyde and we ask him to solve our problem. 
Clyde develops a Kevlar thread with a high-tech ratchet made of carbon fiber put in a necktie. 
Two days later, Mrs. Bad Guy comes home, finds Mr. Bad Guy dead on the bathroom tile, choked to death. 
What I'm saying is, just assume that this guy can hear and see everything that you're doing. 
No, we've got him locked away, maximum security. 
If he's in jail, it's because he wants to be in jail. 
He's a born tactician. Every move that he makes, it means something. 
That cell-mate that he killed - you think that was random? 
No. That's a pawn being moved off the board. 
If I were you, I'd be looking for the next piece. 
Anybody who had anything to do with that case, he's gonna be coming after you. 
So what are you saying? You saying we can't stop him? 
Walk into his cell and put a bullet in his head. Aside from that? No, you can't stop him. 
If Clyde wants you dead, you're dead. 
- Hello? - Sarah? Sarah, it's Nick. 
Set up a meeting with Judge Burch. We need her to help us keep Clyde on ice. 
Help us with what, Nick? 
The man's in prison. He's worse than we thought. 
- Chester's your boyfriend, right? 
- Chester. Yeah. 
Good. Maybe stay a few days at his place. 
And have Dunnigan send a patrol car to my house. 
Sorry about this, Sarah. 
I can't supersede the penal code. 
You've already got him in solitary. A half-decent paralegal will have him out of there by next week. 
We just want to limit his options ; 
give him less contact, less access, even if it's just rescinding his mandatory exercise period for a week. 
- Under what cause? - Whatever cause you want. Wrap it around whatever piece of legal doctrine that helps you rationalize it, Your Honor. 
So let me get this straight : you want me to violate his God-given civil rights in the name of some murky sense of the greater good. 
Is that the gist of it, gentlemen? 
Okay. I'm game. 
Just don't plan on it sticking for long, all right? 
Wait, you're gonna take that, after all the grief you've given me over cell phones? 
That's one of the benefits of being a judge, Mr. Rice. I can pretty much do whatever I want. 
Oh my God. 
Back out. Back out. 
... at city hall, though we are unable to confirm the details, we do know that at least one person is dead in what officials are calling a possible murder. 
We have reporters on the ground... 
Somebody's helping this guy - a bomb in that phone, and she doesn't know about it. 
Who had access? 
Are you okay? 
I've survived the war and two ex-wives. I'll be fine. 
How are you holding up? 
I'm good. 
So you're killing judges now? 
In my experience, Nick, lessons not learned in blood are soon forgotten. 
And vengeance keeps you warm at night. 
Vengeance? 
That's what you think this is about? Vengeance? 
What else could it be? 
No, Nick, I had 10 years for vengeance, if that's what I wanted. 
You don't think that I watch you go to work every morning at 8 : 00 AM? 
Or that I watch Kelly take Denise to school, 8 : 15? 
No, I could have slaughtered you or your family anytime I wanted! 
You even think about touching my family - you even think about touching my family... 
I do my job. 
I'm the best at it. 
- It works. - You were doing yourjob the way that best served you, Nick - the way that best served you. 
- That has to change. 
- What do you want, Clyde? 
You at war with the whole world? It's not gonna bring anybody back. 
No, I'm at war with this - this - this broken thing - this thing that brought you and I together. 
This broken thing works for people that are sane. 
You think doing what you're doing is gonna change anything? 
You and whoever else you have helping you are gonna pay. 
I don't think you have any idea who's helping me or what I'm doing. 
It's a matter of time. 
See, you see the bodies, you see the smoke, but the larger picture still eludes you. 
Do tell. 
I would like to... but I would rather show you. 
I still have faith in you, so I'm gonna give you one last chance. 
Here's the deal : 
release me and drop all charges by 6 : 00 AM. 
- 6 : 00 AM, Nick. 
- Or what? 
Or I kill everyone. 
- Yeah, Sarah, he has to have an accomplice - probably somebody inside the prison. 
We have to go through all the prisoners files to find some sort of connection. 
Do you want the files brought to the office? 
No, there isn't time. 
Get everybody together and bring them to the prison. We're moving in. 
Stop looking at your watch. 
Anything from your friend? 
This treaty with Panama is a mess. 
We can't access anything about specific property holdings, but my friend found this tiny loophole that grants us access to Clyde's corporate expenses. 
Does that help? 
So we match sale prices of industrial properties sold in Philly up against purchases made by his corporation. 
Okay, I got it. 
- Hey, Nick, can I ask you something? 
Would you do it the same way now? Would you still cut a deal for Darby? 
This is the job, Sarah. 
We have to make choices. 
- But did you make the right choice? 
- We made the right choice, right? 
I don't know. I'm 35, Nick. 
And there are things - there are possibilities that I'm not gonna have now. 
And it's okay. I know it's part of the deal. 
And don't get me wrong. I love working for you. 
But I just want to make sure I gave up those things for more than just a high conviction rate. 
Do you want any more coffee? 
No. 
All right. 
All right, let's just get focused here. 
This guy's not God. He's not the All Powerful. 
He's just well-prepared. We need to be equally well-prepared. 
Take a couple of hours, go home, come back. We'll get a fresh start. Okay? 
Hey, Nick, get some rest. 
Give Chester my regards. 
When do I get to meet him? 
Oh, he's not ready for that. 
'Night, Jonas. 
I don't know how this one's gonna turn out, Nick. We're gonna stop him. 
That's how it's gonna turn out. 
Sarah. 
In the past 48 hours, six officials from the Justice Department have been killed in a series of vicious and premeditated attacks. 
This marks the first time in the history of the United States where government officials have been, by all appearances, systematically murdered. 
Nick, I'm sorry to have to do this now, but we've got something here. 
Found this right outside the wall - radio beacon - sent an arming signal to the car bombs when they went through the gate. 
Security said they checked every car before anybody got in them. They didn't check the gas tanks. That's where the clever prick put' em. 
Real precise stuff too. 
Could have taken out a lot more if he wanted to. 
- What about Nick's car? 
- That's the weird thing. 
It's clean - hadn't been touched. 
I gotta go. 
Jesus Christ. 
Privacy, please. 
So let me get this straight : 
not only do we know who did it, we have him locked up and he's still killing people? 
You boys sure fucked this one up. 
The press is gonna kill us. 
Can someone explain this to me? 
We can't yet. 
How did this get away from you, Jonas? 
It's complicated, April. 
He's very smart. 
He's very angry. We assume he has an accomplice helping him on the outside. 
I'm not having this conversation. 
I don't care how smart he is or who's helping him. 
We'll release a statement saying we have suspects, we're following leads nothing alarming. 
- Mayor, you have my word, we are gonna stop this guy. 
He's not gonna hurt anybody else. 
I'm assigning security to each of you from now on. 
Get this situation under control, gentlemen. 
Dad? I bet you don't remember when I did that. 
I bet you I do. 
What? 
Nothing. You and your mother are going away on a little vacation, that's all. 
- You like vacations, right? - Yeah. 
Good. But why? 
Why not now? 
Okay. Don't need an excuse, right? 
All right. No phone calls, no credit cards, no computers - just cash. 
Daddy, are you coming? 
Oh, yeah, of course. - Of course I am. 
- You'd better, Nick. 
It was first grade, hmm? 
Your mother helped you with the spelling. 
It was my birthday. 
- Let's go. 
- Bye, Daddy. 
- Bye. - Love you, Daddy. 
- Love you too. 
- Nick, your phone lines are clear. - Good. No bugs ; nothing's been tampered with. 
You should have taken my deal. 
That's six fucking innocent people. 
Is that how you want to play it? 
Huh? It's okay. It's okay, Nick. 
I know you're angry. That's good. 
That's what it takes. 
That's how it has to be. What if I said you was right and I was wrong? What if I had said," Well, let's take them to trial"? 
Huh? Then I would say you're making progress. 
And we might have lost! 
And Ames and Darby would both go free. 
Don't you get that? 
Fuck. You didn't care, Nick. 
You didn't even try. 
You could have walked out of that courtroom with your head held high. I could have lived with that, Nick. 
I keep my head up. And you will end this. 
I'm just getting warmed up. 
This is Von Clausewitz shit - total fucking war. 
I'm gonna pull the whole thing down. 
I'm gonna bring the whole fucking diseased, corrupt temple down on your head. 
It's gonna be Biblical. 
Jesus, Nick, she was a good kid. 
Did we bring this all on ourselves? 
Absolutely not. 
You don't actually believe that, do you? 
Gentlemen? Sorry, but we need to get going if we're going to make it to the press conference. 
I want to read you something from my speech before we go. 
" We must not give in to the fear. We must face those things we fear the most. 
We must appeal to our better angels." 
Too much? 
I'm sorry. 
It's just before, when you asked if we brought this on ourselves - we didn't. 
I did. 
When I was young, I really wanted to change the system. 
You know, I was ready to fight. I was gonna be the best no matter what. 
You give an inch here, you give an inch there, you get caught up in the game. 
And then you realize that the system that you're trying to change - it changed you. 
Jonas, I've lost my way somewhere. 
Look, remember what I told you? 
The hard part isn't making the decision. 
It's living with it. 
Everybody stay sharp. We're on the move. 
- We all right? 
- It's dead. Electrical system's fried. 
What's going on back there? 
Dunnigan, tell them to get Jonas away from here. 
What the fuck is that? 
Get down, get down! 
Jonas! Jonas! 
- Jonas! Jonas! 
- No, Nick! Get back! 
Get off of me! Please listen to me! 
Jonas! 
I told you to handle this. 
You didn't. Now we have a jailed psychopath that's managed to bring this entire city to its knees. 
One of my friends was just murdered. 
More than one of my friends is gone, Mayor. 
What I should do is fire you. 
Hmm? Right now. 
I resign. 
- Is that your real answer? 
- I think that's best. 
No. 
I'm not gonna allow that to happen. Bring me the Bible. 
I'm not gonna let some criminal decide whether Philadelphia has a DA or not. 
As of now, you're acting District Attorney. 
We'll have a formal swearing in later. 
For now this will suffice. Stand up. 
Put your left hand on the Bible. Raise your right hand. Repeat after me. 
- I, Nicolas Rice... - I, Nicolas Rice... -... do solemnly swear... 
-... do solemnly swear... -... that I will support... -... that I will support... 
-... obey and defend the Constitution of the United States and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania... 
People aren't going to work ; kids aren't going to school. 
They're scared, and I don't blame them. 
So I'm implementing the emergency provision of the Philadelphia code. We're gonna lock this city down. 
Starting now, no one moves in this city unrestricted. 
I want a show of force for the public - uniforms, detectives, 12-hour shifts. Put an armed cop on every corner. 
If you have to give shotguns to the meter maids, do it. 
There should be no doubt in people's minds that this city is secure and under our control. 
Okay, Clyde. 
I get it. 
Listen, that contraption that killed Cantrell, it was a weaponized bomb-disposal robot. 
Can you believe that? 
Damn thing had video, night vision - you name it. 
It's like military api, for Christ's sakes. 
That's anti-tank rounds, Nick. 
I think he's saving you for last. 
Nick, I'm serious. 
I appreciate the insight. 
Nick, you gotta get in front of this guy if you want to stay alive. 
I may have a way - something a friend is helping me out with. 
Who's your friend? 
A friend named Chester. 
I'll call you back. 
Thank you, Sarah. 
This is Nick. Give me the real-estate listing of every industrial property sold here in the last 10 years. 
Motherfucker. 
You're kidding me, right? 
You're saying Clyde owns this place? 
Something about it sticks out, right? 
Yeah. 
What - are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do? 
- What about his civil rights? 
- Fuck his civil rights. 
There's got to be something in here. 
Remember this from outside the house? 
Get that right there. 
Un-fucking-believable. 
Look at this. 
Watch your step. 
This guy tunneled into prison? 
Oh, shit. 
Fuck - Semtex. 
Got police uniforms, other disguises. 
He tunneled into every cell. 
Over here. 
He wanted to be transferred to solitary. 
Surprise, motherfucker. 
- He's not here! 
- If he's not there, then where is he? 
Nomos, what happened to your eye? 
Oh, long story. 
Stop right there, sir. Let me see your ID, please. 
- Yeah, sure. 
- Thank you. Turn around, sir. Extend your arms. 
Something going on tonight? - The mayor. 
- Mmm, mayor. 
Look at this. 
He tapped into the prison cameras. 
Jesus, he's got cameras everywhere. 
- Is that your house? Yes. 
Baby, please tell me you're okay. 
Denise - where is she? 
Is she with you? Are you sure? 
Stay where you are. I'll explain later. 
I love you. 
Von Clausewitz. 
He's at City Hall. 
You're free to go, sir. 
- Sorry for the inconvenience, sir. 
- No, don't worry about it. 
Better to be safe than sorry, right? 
Get ready to evacuate the building. 
We'll need a tactical unit and a bomb squad. 
Have them come in soft. If Shelton spots them or any of us, we're fucked. 
- Where's the tactical team? 
- En route. 
- They're coming in soft - no sirens. - Bomb squad? 
You're looking at it. 
Right, okay. We take the north surge ; you take the west. 
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa. 
- IDs, please. - He's the fucking DA. 
- Good for him. IDs, please. 
What's going on here tonight? 
- Security meeting with all the brass. 
- What floor? 6th floor - caucus room. 
- What floor is this? 
- That's the 5th floor, sir. 
Directly below the caucus room. 
You catch this motherfucker red-handed, we gotta take him alive. 
Where is he? 
What the fuck are we looking for? Wait wait wait. Right there. 
Stand back. Don't touch anything. 
It wasn't exactly my first instinct. 
Malglinite. 
This shit'll take out the entire floor and the one above us. 
Looks like it's - looks like it's triggered by this cell phone here. 
What? So an incoming call arms it? 
Yeah. Maybe 30 seconds till boom time. 
- Jesus. 
- Dunnigan, what are you doing? - I'm calling the mayor's security. 
- We can't. Clyde is watching. He sees him evacuate and he will detonate this thing. 
We don't tell the mayor anything. 
So what do we do? 
Wait a second. 
We've got something. 
Mayor April Henry. 
Thank you for coming in on short notice. 
I have one simple question. 
Why is Clyde Shelton still in my city? 
Now I refuse to believe that one man is smarter than Homeland Security, the fbi, the sheriff's department, or Philly PD. 
I don't care how we do it, or what kind of obscure legal justification we have to invoke, gentlemen. 
I don't care what laws we have to bend. 
I am sure that there is a provision of the Homeland Security Act that we can activate. 
Just get him out of here by tomorrow. 
Clyde? 
Nick. 
I wasn't expecting company. 
Yeah, I would have - I would have cleaned up a little. 
Never seen anybody tunnel into prison before. 
And the solitary confinement? That was clever. 
Well, that's how winners play. 
We convince the other guy he's making all the right moves. 
So did you ever catch my accomplice? 
Yeah, I did. It's the end of the road for you now. 
You played us, Clyde. 
You played us real good. 
Thank you. 
You know, I'm glad you finally get to appreciate some of the effort that I put into all of this. 
Well, you set out to make a point, Clyde. 
You made it. No, people still don't get it. 
They don't appreciate what I'm trying to say, Nick, but they will soon enough. 
A man I cared about once told me that we can't retract the decisions that we've made, we can only affect the decisions we're going to make from here. 
- Are you trying to save me now, Nick? 
- I'm giving you a way out. Big difference. 
Stand up for those principles you've been preaching. See, we're all held accountable, Clyde. 
That includes you. Why don't we do the right thing here? 
I'm doing the right thing, Nick. 
You just have to see it that way. 
By murdering all those people, all you're doing is destroying the memory of your daughter and causing the same pain that you're suffering from. 
So what do you suggest, Nick? 
Make another deal? 
One final offer? Is that what it is? 
I don't make deals with murderers anymore, Clyde. 
You taught me that. 
Finally. 
Well done. 
Bravo. Maybe I wasn't such a bad teacher after all. 
If you go through with this, Clyde, it's a decision you'll have to live with for the rest of your life. 
I'm sorry, Nick. 
Me too. 
Like I said, Clyde, it's a decision you'll have to live with for the rest of your life, which I figure by now is about 25 more seconds. 
Previously on" lost"... whatever ben linudiddown at the orchid station, it may have... dislodged us. 
the islandis moving through time? Yeah, either the island is, or we are. 
I need you to go backto oxford university. 
Go back to where we met! I need you to go there and findmy mother! 
Her name is- - are you all right? 
I was on the island. 
You've been off the islandfor three years. You're safe now. 
It was just a dream. 
it wasn't a dream, pen. it was a memory. 
efren salonga? Ef-efren salonga! Efren salonga? 
- Who are you? 
- Are you the doctor? Yes. 
What's the matter with you? 
- You're sure you knowwhat you're doing, yeah? 
- Yes, yes! Because there'sa lot of blood, man! 
How much blood? 
I'm coming, penny! 
it's okay, pen. We've got a doctor. 
where have you been? 
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. 
okay. Just breathe, penny, okay? 
J-just breathe. breathe. I can't breathe. 
You're doing great. You're doing great, okay. 
Okay, just be strong, yeah? Okay. 
- make it come out. - Please be strong. 
- I can't! 
- yes, you--yes, you can, penny. 
Push! 
Push! okay, push now, penny. 
Push. Now! come on, penny. 
Push harder! 
I can see the head! I can see the head! 
- One more time! Push! - I can see it. 
it's coming! 
you did it. you did it. 
You did it. It's a boy. 
I love you, penny. I love you. 
Oh, oh, he's beautiful. Beautiful. 
Oh, my god. He's so beautiful. Oh, my god. 
I love you. 
look. Right out there. 
Beyond where you can see, there's--there's an island, and it'sa very special island. 
I left it a long time ago. 
I never thoughtI'd see it again. 
It's called great britain. 
And the most beautiful partof the island is scotland, and that's whereyour daddy's from. 
There's mountains and glensand monsters in deep lochs, and... and it's whereyour mommy and daddy... fell in love. 
it's also wherehe broke her heart. 
Yeah, well, I... I thought I'd leavethat wee bit out of it. 
You also left outthe bit about his grandfather- - the man who sent a boatto the island to kill all daddy's friends. 
We'll be in and out. 
He'll neverknow we're here, penny. 
Don't underestimate him, desmond. 
If he finds out we're here, I don't know what he'll do. 
But this has nothing to dowith your father, penny. 
We are herebecause of daniel faraday. 
what he told me- - that everyone on that islandis in danger, and I am the only onethat can help them. 
I have to do this, penny. 
Are you surethat's what he said? 
Yeah, sawyer saidto meet at the creek, so unless he got torchedby a flaming arrow, that's where heand everyone else should be. 
Hey, how's your headache? worse, actually. 
But consideringwe're running for our lives, I'm not gonna complain. 
You have any dizzinessor double vision? 
Both, actually. 
Why do you look so worried? 
Is it because you knowwhat's happening to me? Listen to me. 
Nothing is gonna happen to you. Nothing. 
I won't let it. 
hey, we're here! 
Some rendezvous. 
It's just us. 
well, we should probably wait, see if they show up. 
They could beright behind us. Yeah, or they came and left. 
Or they're dead. 
Miles, that right there, that kind of attitude... not exactly what we needright now. 
People are scared enoughas it is.Miles- - miles? 
Wait! Don't move! 
who's in charge here? 
He is. 
You just couldn't stay away, could you? 
LOST Season05 Episode03 
Did he finish his breakfast? 
Yeah. 
Gave me a bit of a fight, but he listens in the end... unlike his father. 
look, honey, all I have to do is find his mother, tell her he's still on the island, and then I'm done with this for good. 
Why now? I mean, if he told you all this on the island, why didn't you remember it until two days ago? 
I don't know. 
Look, I don't understand how any of this works any more than you do. 
It... look, i know it happened. 
Daniel faraday knocked on the hatch door and told me to go to oxford... everyone was in danger, and I was the only one that could save them. 
I know how insane it sounds. 
I'll be back by dark, and then I'm done... forever. 
I promise. 
If you're gonna promise me something, des, can you promise me you'll never go back to that island again? 
why in god's name would I ever go back there? 
There were 20 of you at the beach, but only five of you here. 
Where are the rest of your people? 
Maybe they got blown up by some more of your land mines. 
we didn't put them here. You did. 
once we leave here, I will be out of control of what happens to you. 
But if you cooperate now, things will go much easier for you. 
So where are the rest of your people? 
I don't know. 
who are these people? 
Well, gee, I didn't have time to ask that, with frogurt on fire and all. 
They attacked us on the beach. 
This is a 30-caliber m1 garand rifle. It looks new. 
Who cares about the rifle? 
Where the hell you been? 
If you've been going through what I have, james, maybe the more appropriate question would be, when the hell have I been? 
- What happened to your leg? 
- I got shot. 
by who? we can swap stories later. 
We told the rest of our group that we would meet them at the creek. 
If there's any chance of reconnecting with them, we'd better get moving. 
Fine, seeing as we have no rope to make sure these two don't try to kill us again. 
Guess we're gonna have to shoot' em. 
- Quare non sunt vestitus eis? - Tace! What? 
- what kind of language is that? 
- They're speaking latin. 
That one asked why we aren't in uniform, and this one told him to shut up. 
And how is it that they know how to speak latin, juliet? 
The same reason I do. 
Because they're others. 
Yeah. We just walked over a fresh grave. 
What? 
Four U.S.Soldiers, dead just under a month. 
Three of them were shot. 
One diedof radiation poisoning. 
Miles, hey, hey. Did any of them happento mention what year it is? 
we're here. 
richard? We're back. 
Caught the threeby the creek. 
This one's their leader. 
- What's your name? 
- What's your name? 
My name is richard alpert. 
I assume you've come backfor your bomb. 
no, I'm sorry, sir. I'm not find a recordof any faraday. 
No, that--that's impossible. 
'Cause I know her sonwas a professor here. 
His name's daniel faraday. 
I'm sure he's in your database. 
Sir, there's no recordof any faraday ever having been employedhere at oxford. 
I visited him. 
I went to his lab. It was ian attic. It was... it was abovethe physics department. 
the archives go backquite far. Perhaps there wasa clerical error. 
You don't happen to recallthe year it was in which you last visited? 
The year? 
No. I'M... I'm not exactly sure. 
May I ask why you'reseeking this information? 
sorry I wasted your time. 
yeah, I wouldn't touch that. 
I wondered whensomeone'd figure out were weren'tjust fumigating here. 
you a professor? No. 
Not exactly. 
Well... at least you're honest. 
So why'd you tell menot to touch it? 
Because I'm the one who had to take the rats that he made run through this bloody thingdown to the incinerator so that no one would find out what he was up to. 
You mean daniel faraday. Yeah. 
You're not the first oneto poke around here, asking about himand his work. 
Rumor had it, he was trying tosend rats' brains back in time. 
Ridiculous, innit? 
aye. Look, I'll forgetyou broke my lock if you tell your matesthat all you found was rubbishleft behind by a madman. 
Fair enough. 
Faraday- - the university saysthere's no record of him. 
Well, can you blame' em? I mean, after what he'd doneto that poor girl? 
What girl? 
hey, take it easy. 
It's all right, dan. I'm fine. 
We are so dead. 
No, no, no. We are not so dead. 
We're gonna be fine. We just need to keep it togetheruntil there's another flash. 
All right? Then all this disappears. 
And when's that gonna happen? 
Could be five minutes. Could also be 5,000 years. 
That's--that's just awesome. 
What is going on, dan? Why are they doing this to us? 
I'm not sure. 
But they must think that we'rewith the american military. 
And if that's the case, our best chance of staying alive is to let them keep thinking it, all right? 
sorry. Am I interrupting? 
Ellie tells me thatyou're not willing to reveal where the rest your squad is. 
And why would I do that? So you can kill them, too? 
We didn't start this, friend. Your people attacked us. 
You come to our island to run your tests, you fire on us, - and what, you expect usnot to defend ourselves? 
- I don't know anythingabout that. We are scientists. 
So what? So they sent you hereto recover it? 
If you mean our hydrogen bomb, then yes. 
And I'm guessing fromthis man's radiation burns that the housinghas been compromised. 
You need to listen to me. 
You have an unstable device that's capable of destroyingthis entire island, and it's broken. 
If you don't allow meto render it inert, all of us are gonna die. All of us. 
How do I know you weren't senthere on some suicide mission? That I'll take youout to the bomb, and you'll just detonate it? 
Because... I'm in love with the womansitting next to me. 
And I would never... I'd never do anythingto hurt her. 
All right. Take care of your bomb. But you try anything else, and you will hurt her. 
so who taught you latin? 
Others 101. 
Gotta learn latin--language of the enlightened. 
Enlightened, my ass. 
I suggest you talk to us. 
Once we get backto the creek and meet upwith the rest of our people, there's gonna be a lotof anger directed at you for attacking them. 
the rest of your people are either captured or dead. What? 
What makes you say that? 
That idiot shouted out," meet at the creek." 
We knew exactly ere thsent a group after them. 
Well, maybe I should've said it in my secret language. 
James, wait. 
* * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * * * what the hell are you sayin'? 
* * * * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
Did you just say" richard alpert"? 
John, please. 
* * * * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * 
all right. 
Okay, we need to head eastanother couple of kilometers unl we hit the ridge- - shoot him! 
shoot, damn it! 
are you crazy? What were you thinking? 
Why didn't you shoot him? 
Because... he's one of my people. 
and who might you be? 
Uh, my name's desmond hume. 
I'm looking for theresa spencer. 
I'm abigail spencer. Theresa's my sister. Oh, right. 
Um, can I havea word with her? 
You wanna speak to theresa? 
Yeah, I got her name from a-a gentlemanI met at oxford university- - um... 
- daniel faraday. 
- Daniel faraday? 
Well, why didn't you say so? 
Please, you must come in. 
Thanks. 
he didn't tell you, did he? No. 
No, he didn'T. 
Can she hear us? 
No. Theresa's away right now. 
" Away"? What do you mean? 
Well, sometimes she wakes up, thinks she's 3, wants to knowwhere her dolly is. 
Yesterday, she was talking to our dad. 
He died five years ago. 
I'm sorry. 
Um, this was a mistake. I... I shouldn't have come. 
Of course. Why would you want to stay? 
Daniel certainly didn'T. 
He left her like this? 
Went running off to the states, ner to be heard from again. He abandoned her. 
What kind of a mandoes that? 
I seriously don't knowwhat we would've done if it hadn't beenfor mr. Widmore. 
Uh, I'm sorry. 
Who? Daniel's benefactor. 
He funded his research, and he took responsibilityfor the result of it. 
He's been taking care of theresaever since this happened to her. 
Everything hereis due to mr. Widmore, god bless him. 
A hydrogen bomb? 
Seriously? 
Back in the' 50s, the U.S.Government testedh-bombs in the south pacific. 
Lucky us. 
You didn't haveto say that. 
Say what? 
That you loved me. 
I mean, there areplenty of other ways you could've convinced him you weren't gonna blow upthe entire island. 
I said what I said because I meant it, charlotte. 
Right, then. 
Let's go. 
Back soon. I promise. 
whatever your, uh, your superiors told you, I want youto know the truth. 
A month ago, we found18 members of an army battalion right here in our jungle here, setting up this camp. 
We gave them the oortunityto leave the island peacefully. They weren't willing to do that, so I was forced to kill' em. 
All of' em. 
- Forced? - Yeah. 
By whom? 
Y-you answer to someone, don't you? - You followa chain of command, right? - Yeah. 
Yeah, well, so do I. 
richard! Richard! 
What the hellhappened to you? 
Cunningham and I--a group of them surprised us. 
We were outnumbered, but I escaped. outnumbered, eh? 
Shut up, ellie. 
Who's this? 
He's gonna help ustake care of our problem. You'd better get going. 
Wait. He's one of them. 
- You can't actually trust him. - Yeah, you heard me, ellie. 
H-how did you escape? 
I ran. 
And it never occurred to youthat they might follow you? Follow me? 
Their leader issome sodding old man. 
What, you thinkhe can track me? 
You think he knows this islandbetter than i do? 
How did you knowrichard would be here? 
Richard's always been here. 
How old is he? 
Old. 
Why are you so interestedin richard, john? 
I'm inrested in him because he was about to tell mehow I could save us. 
-" Save us"? - Yeah. 
But before he could finish, we were interruptedby that flash of light. 
And I'm hoping we can pick up where we left off. 
I hate to bust up the" I'm an other, you're an other" reunion, but faraday--the guy that's actually gonna save us- - is being death maredinto the jungle right now. 
Good luck with that. 
You're not gonnahelp me save him? No. 
I'm gonna go down and finishmy conversation with richard. 
That's gonnaget us all killed. 
You go rolling in there, they're gonna know we're here. 
Fair enough. I'll give youten minutes head start. 
What about you? You wanna stay herein crazytown or help me rescue the geek? 
Why do you keeplooking at me? 
- No, no, I'm--I'm not.I- - - you are. 
You know what? You're right. I'm--I'm sorry. 
It's just... you look so much like... someone I used to know. 
Someone other than the girl you just professed your love for? 
Well, aren't you the romeo. 
Far from it, believe me. 
I don't believe you, by the way. 
You may have richard fled, you can't reallyexpect me to believe that you, a british womanand a chinese man are all members ofthe united states military. 
Who are you and what are you doingon our island? 
You wanna know who I am? 
I'm your best chance at disarming that bomb. 
Right, then, disarm it. 
What are you doing up there? 
I'm examining it. 
- Back up. - What? 
Get back, get back. It's unsafe. 
I swear, if you try anything... if I try anything- - what, you're gonna--you're gonna shoot me? 
Yeah, that would be perfectbecause, of course, rifle fire right next to--what would you call this- - hydrogen bomb? 
Yes, fantastic idea. Really... inspired. 
Okay, listen to me. Do you people have any access to lead or concrete? 
For what? 
There's a crack in the casing. It needs to be filled with lead. 
You need to take it offthis platform carefully and bury it. 
You brought meall the way out here to tell usthat we have to bury it? 
You told alpert you could disarm that thing. 
You don't need to worry. You do what I say, you bury it, it won't go off. 
How do you know that? 
I need you to trust me. - I don't trust you. 
- Just bury it. Bury it, and everything will be fine. 
- Remember, your superior ordered me to take care of this. 
- How can you be so sure? 
- You wanna take care of this bomb? - How? - You bury it! 
- W do you know that? Because 50 years from now, this island is still here! 
There you... what did you just say? 
Take it easy. 
I can explain myselfa little better. 
I know how this sounds. Believe me, it'S... oh, it's hard to explain. 
50 years from now, me and my. 
me and my friends- - that's where we're from, okay? 
And here's the key--everything's fine. 
I'm not sayingit's perfectly fine, but there hasn't beenany atomic blasts, all right? 
- There has not- - - drop the gun, blondie. 
It's okay. 
She's okay. 
- You can put your gun down. - She puts hers down first. 
Why don't we allput our guns down? 
I said, drop it! 
son of a bitch. 
Are theyfrom the future, too? 
You told her? 
sir! Sir, you can't- - 
mr. Widmore. 
I'm so sorry. He charged right past me. 
That's all right, melanie. 
Mr. Hume is A... colleague of mine. 
Please leave us. 
I know you have questionsfor me. 
I'm not gonna answer them. 
I've come hereto ask you something. 
And once you've told meeverything I need to know, you'll never see me again. 
Understand? 
All right. 
I need to know where I can finddaniel faraday's mother. 
What makes you think I wouldeven know the answer to that? 
Because even before you putfaraday on your little boat and sent himoff to the island, you spent ten yearsfunding his research. 
So i figure, you must know something regarding his next of kin. 
Desmond, I haven't seen or heard frommy daughter for three years. 
Just answer me this. 
Is she safe? 
Where's faraday's mother? 
she's in los angeles. 
This is an address for her. 
I suspect she won'tbe pleased to see you. 
She's a very private person. 
wait, desmond. 
Deliver your message... but then get outof this mess. 
Don't put penny's lifein danger. 
Danger? 
You're getting yourselfinvolved in something that goes backmany, many years. It has nothing to do with youor my daughter. 
Wherever you were hiding... go back there. 
thanks for the advice. 
Richard alpert! 
- I'm looking for richard. 
- Don't move. 
- Richard alpert! - On the ground now. 
- Richard, I need to talk to you! 
- Shut your mouth! that's enough! 
Who are you? 
my name is john locke. 
Is that supposedto mean something to me? 
Jacob sent me. 
- Put the gun down. 
- What? 
Richard, you can'tseriously trust him. 
I said... put the gun down, widmore. 
your name is widmore? 
Charles widmore? 
What's it to you? 
Nothing. 
It'S... nice to meet you. 
* * * But it saw the bearso that it ran away again. 
- Good day? 
- Yeah. He wanted to go fishingin the thames. 
We were unsuccessful. 
And you? Did you find faraday's mum? 
There was no one to find. 
She, um... she died a few years ago. 
Why are you lying to me? 
- what? I'm not. 
- Where is she? 
she's in los angeles. 
Look, pen, you've got nothingto worry about. 
You know, this was a mistake. 
No, I... I me a promise thatthis would be done in a day, and now it's done. 
It's not our problem anymore. 
and what happensif you wake up tomorrow and remember something else? - Then I'll forget it. - And the next day? 
I'll forget it. 
It doesn't matter, pen. You're my life now--you and charlie. 
I won't leave you again... not for this... not for anything. 
you'll neverforget it, des. 
So I guesswe're going with you. 
i gave you this? 
Yes. 
After you were shotin the leg and I... Wandered outof the jungle to patch you up? 
That's right. 
Thenhy don't I remember... well, any of this? 
Because it hasn'thappened yet. 
I'm not sure what you'reexpecting me to say, john locke. 
I expect you to tell me how to get off the island. 
That'svery privileged information. Why would I share itwith you? 
Because you told me that I hadsomething very impornt to do once I get there. 
And because I'm your leader. 
That's what you told me. 
Look, I... certainly don'twant to contradict myself, but... we havea very specific process for selectingour leadership, and it startsat a very, very young age. 
All right. 
What year is it right now? 
It's 1954. 
All right. 
May 30, 1956--2 years from now- - that's the day I'm born- - tustin, california, and if you don't believe me, I suggest you comeand visit me. 
- oh, no. 
- What's wrong? 
It's about to happen again. 
- You need to tell me now, richard. - How do I get off the island? Please! 
Tell me! 
you all right? 
Yeah. I think so. 
Charlotte! 
- You okay? 
- Yeah, I'm fine. 
Yeah, me, too. I'm great, too. 
Charlotte. charlotte! 
No, no, no. Look it. Look at me, look at me. 
It's okay. 
Charlotte! 
Previously on" Lost"... 
How did you know my father? 
He came to see his daughter. 
My daughter was on your plane. 
Her name was Claire. 
We're here to get a blood sample from you... and one from your son Aaron. 
Why? 
To determine your relationship to the child. 
Where are you going, mommy? 
We're going on vacation, baby. 
Wait, you're in L.A.? 
Of course we can meet, yeah. 
Hello, Kate. 
You okay? 
Get me to the car. 
- Sayid, you've been attacked. 
- Where's Hurley? 
The only way to save the island, John, is to get your people back here. 
How am I supposed to do that? 
What? 
You've... 
Do you know what's happening to me? 
Charlotte? 
Charlotte? 
Hey. Oh, you don't have to whisper. 
- When he's out, he's out. - Yeah. 
At least one of us can sleep. 
It's gonna take more than two nights... for me to get used to sleeping in a normal bed. 
What are we gonna do about him? 
About Aaron. 
I don't know. 
I've been thinking a lot about him. 
Did you know that Claire was flying to L.A. to give him up for adoption? 
No, I didn't. 
I think we should say he's mine. 
What? 
We could say that I was six months pregnant when I was arrested and that I gave birth to him on the island. 
- No one would ever know. 
- Kate. No. 
You don't have to... 
There's other ways to do this. 
After everyone we've lost... Michael, Jin, Sawyer... 
I can't lose him, too. 
Sawyer's not dead. 
I know. 
But he's gone. 
Good night, Jack. 
Kate. 
If we're gonna be safe, if we're gonna protect the people that we left behind, tomorrow morning, I'm gonna have to convince everyone to lie. 
If it's just me, they're never gonna go for it. 
So I'm gonna turn to you first. 
Are you with me? 
I have always been with you. 
How does it fit? 
It's perfect. 
Thank you for the loaner. 
Looks great on you. 
Are you sure you want to do this? 
It was your idea. 
Mommy! 
Aaron, honey, mommy's gonna run out and do an errand. 
I'll be right back. Okay? 
And then we can go home. 
Don't worry about us, Kate. 
There's candy in the minibar and a hundred channels on tv. 
We're going to be just fine here. 
Sun... 
I don't know what I would've done if you weren't here. 
Thank you. 
It's what any friend would do. 
Okay, well, I will be back soon. 
Okay, you be good for Sun. 
Okay, honey? 
Good luck. 
Delivery for you, Ms. Kwon. 
- Thank you. - Thanks. 
I'll be right back, honey. 
Charlotte? 
Charlotte. 
What the hell is wrong with her? 
She's been out for ten minutes. 
Stop shouting, James. 
Hey, man. 
Thank you. 
If there's something that you want to tell me, Daniel, now would be a good time. 
I'm not sure what you mean exactly. 
She's asking if you know why your girlfriend had a seizure. 
Give us some space, would you? 
She's like this' cause the sky keeps lighting up. 
He knew this would happen and he didn't say squat about it. James. 
Go away. 
Did you know that this would happen? 
I thought... 
I thought it might. 
I think it's neurological. 
Our brains have an internal clock, a sense of time. 
The flashes... throw the clock off. 
It's like really bad jet lag. 
Really bad jet lag doesn't make you hemorrhage, Daniel. 
You wanna tell me why it isn't happening to the rest of us? I don't know. 
But thank God it's not. 
Thank you for waiting. 
Did my assistant offer you something to drink? 
Um, yes. 
I'm fine, thank you. 
Good. 
Please, Ms. Austen, sit. 
So... 
How can I help you? 
Mr. Norton, when you came to my house looking for blood samples from me and my son, I asked you who your client was. 
- And I said I couldn't tell you. 
- Yeah. 
I'm here to offer you a deal. 
I'll give you the blood samples, but first, I wanna talk to your client. 
Considering what you're asking for, that's more than reasonable. 
Well, I am, uh, seeing my client later today, and I will be sure to pass along your offer. 
But I am pretty sure of what the answer's gonna be : 
No. 
And the reason, of course, is that you're in no position to be making any kind of deals, and we both know it. 
I have a signed court order compelling you to let us confirm that you're the child's mother. 
I could send the sheriff over there today and make you do it, but my client insists that we... handle the exchange of custody quietly. 
What do you mean" exchange of custody"? 
You know exactly what I mean. 
No, I... 
Mr. Norton, 
I just wanna know who is doing this to me. 
You did this to yourself. 
Now it is time you prepare yourself, Ms. Austen. 
You are going to lose the boy. 
We have to go back to The Orchid. 
Excuse me? 
The Orchid. 
That's where all this started. 
Maybe it's where it'll all stop. 
That greenhouse is a long ways away. 
You said you had a zodiac raft back at the beach. 
We could take that, cut around the horn of the island, be at The Orchid in half the time. 
And let me guess. 
You know exactly what to do when we get there. 
No, not exactly at all, but I know that Ben used it to leave the island. 
And if I can do the same thing, I believe I can save us. 
And how you gonna do that? 
This is all happening because they left. 
I think it'll stop if I can bring them back. 
- Bring who back? 
- Jack, Sun, Sayid, Hugo, Kate. 
The boat blew up, and that chopper was probably on it. 
They're not dead, James. 
- Says who? 
- That doesn't matter. 
All that matters is they've gotta come back. 
I have to make them come back... even if it kills me. 
Don't you want' em to come back, James? 
Don't you want her to come back? 
It doesn't matter what I want. 
Hey! She's waking up! 
Are you okay? 
Who are you? 
It's me. 
It's Daniel. 
Daniel. 
Oww.. Oh, my head. 
What happened? 
There was another flash. You passed out. 
How do you feel? 
A bit dizzy, but... 
I'm fine. 
Good. 
Hooray. 
Everything's back to normal. 
Now what? 
I'll tell you" now what." 
We're going to The Orchid. 
Dilation's almost back to normal. Good. 
Now take this I.V. out of my arm, and let's go. 
Sayid, you were unconscious for over 42 hours. 
You had the equivalent of three doses of horse tranquilizer in your system. 
If you sent that man to Hurley's house, we have to leave... 
- You need to relax. -... now. 
Ben is not gonna hurt Hurley. 
Ben is on our side. 
The only side he's on is his own. 
Dr. Shephard? 
I'm Dr. Ariza, director of clinical services. 
A word with you, please? 
I'll be right back. 
What do you think you are doing here? 
I was treating a patient. 
I apologize. 
It was an emergency. I know that - 
You were suspended on charges of substance abuse. 
Emergency or not, Dr. Shephard, you have no business being here. 
I understand, and I take full responsibility for my actions. 
No, doctor. 
The hospital takes full responsibility for your actions, and that makes us liable for them. 
Excuse me. 
- Hello? 
- Jack? It's me. 
- Hurley. 
- Hey, did Sayid get to you? 
Did my dad drop him off? 
- Yes, he did. 
Hurley, where are -? 
- Is he okay? 
- He's fine. 
- Awesome. 
Hurley, where are you? 
Dude, I'm totally cool. 
I'm in L.A. County lockup. 
Oh, and tell Sayid I did exactly what he said. 
I'm totally safe. 
Ben's never gonna get me now. Thank you. 
What are you talking about, Hurley? 
Wait! 
Wait - 
Good. 
You're here. 
How's Sayid? 
How are you doing today, sir? 
Got your meds for you. 
Sorry, I think you have the wrong room. 
Nope. 
Room 133, right? 
Got the orders right here. 
Don't worry. 
I won't have to give you an injection. 
Put this right in your I.V. line. 
Who are you? 
Who are you working for? 
Okay, talk, talk. 
Address... it's in my pocket. 
Hello, Sayid. 
What happened? 
Do we know anyone who lives at 42 Panorama Crest? 
That's Kate's address. 
Hello? 
Kate? 
It's Jack. 
Are you okay? 
Yeah. I'm fine. 
Where are you right now? 
Are you at home? 
Uh... What? 
Listen, I'll explain everything once you're out, 
- but you've gotta get Aaron - 
- Look, I'm not at home, okay? I'm... 
Aaron is at a hotel with Sun. 
Sun? 
Sun's in L.A.? 
Yeah, she's here on business. 
Listen, Jack, this is really not a good time. 
I'm so sorry that I even picked up the phone. I'm not - 
Kate, do not hang up on me. Please listen. 
Listen, uh... 
Will you tell me where you are? 
I need to see you. 
Kate, please. 
I'm downtown. 
Wilshire and Olive. Okay. All right. 
I'm on my way. 
She's not at home, but I'm gonna go to her right now. - Good. 
I'll go deal with Hugo. 
- Sorry, Ben. 
I'm not letting you get anywhere near him. 
You have friends in trouble. 
Let's get them to safety and save the dirty linen for later. 
I'll drive. 
After you get Kate, meet us at the Long Beach Marina, slip 23. 
And, Jack... Hurry. 
We're running out of time. 
Hey, Locke. 
What are you gonna say to her? 
Sorry? 
Kate. 
What are you gonna say to her to get her to come back? 
I haven't figured that out yet. 
Well, let me tell you something. 
She was pretty excited to hop on that chopper and get the hell out of here. 
What the hell is that? 
Whatever it is, we better stay clear of it. 
Beach is this way. 
Now you wanna take the scenic route? 
John... 
Do you know when we are? 
We need to keep moving. 
Hey. 
How's your headache? 
Better. 
Nothing like sore feet to take your mind off your head, eh? 
Well, don't worry. 
Once we get to the beach, we're gonna take the zodiac around the other side of the island and rest. 
You're sweet, but you don't need to baby me. 
I'm fine. 
You okay? 
I'm peachy. 
Now what? 
Nobody move. 
James! 
I got this. 
It knows I don't want it, and I was gonna give it away. 
Babies know that stuff. 
Okay, no, no, hang on. 
Listen, listen. 
Do you want this baby? 
Do you want it to be safe and healthy? 
You're not alone in this. 
We are all here for you. 
This baby is all of ours. 
But I need you to push. 
Okay? 
One, two, three... 
Push! 
Push! 
Come on, Claire! 
Push! Okay! 
He's coming! 
Push! 
Push! Push! 
Push! Push! Push! 
Push! Push! 
James? 
What happened? 
Did you see something out here, James? 
It don't matter. 
It's gone now. 
You shaved your beard. 
I just needed a change. 
Look, Jack, uh... 
I don't know why you called, but I can't be dealing with this right now. 
What's going on? 
Nothing. 
Just... 
- Can you just go? 
- Why don't you just tell me? 
Jack, please, just go. 
Kate, please, tell me. 
Somebody wants Aaron. 
What? 
There's a lawyer in there. 
His clients... they know we're lying. 
They know I'm not his mom, and they're gonna take him away. 
Who's gonna take him away? 
What - what are you doing? 
Look, I gotta go, all right? 
Get in or don't. 
You ready to tell me who you saw back there? 
Already told you. 
It was nothin'. 
You and I both know when we were before the flash, James. 
So who was it you saw? 
Charlie? 
Shannon? Yourself? 
And how is it that you knew when we were, Johnny boy? 
That light in the sky... it was from the hatch, wasn't it? 
The night that Boone died... 
I went out there and started pounding on it as hard as I could. 
I was... confused. Scared. 
Babbling like an idiot, asking, why was all this happening to me? 
Did you get an answer? 
Light came on, shot up into the sky. 
At the time, I thought it meant something. 
Did it? 
No. 
It was just a light. 
So why'd you turn us around then? 
Don't you wanna go back there? 
Why would I wanna do that? 
So you could tell yourself to do things different, save yourself a world of pain. 
No, I needed that pain to get to where I am now. 
I just got a nosebleed. 
What? 
When? 
Let's just not freak out the others, okay? 
Just tell me... 
Why-why her? 
Why me? 
I don't know. 
Uh, I think it might have something to do with duration of exposure. 
You know, the amount of time you've spent on the island. 
Doesn't make any sense. 
Those yahoos have been here for months. 
I've never been here before two weeks ago. Are you sure about that? 
Hello? ! 
The camp's back. 
Finally. 
Anybody for a Dharma beer? 
Hello? 
Anybody here? 
Rose? 
Bernard? 
I wonder how long ago this happened. 
Son of a bitch! 
What is it? 
It's Vincent's. 
Yeah? 
Well, where's the rest of the dog? 
Where's the rest of our people? 
The zodiac's gone, too. 
Maybe your people took the boat. 
Why the hell would they do that? 
To get away from whoever came in those. 
Where did these come from? 
That's a good question. 
They're pretty old. 
Not that old. 
Let me see that. 
" adg-uh-ruh"? 
Ajira. 
It's an airline. 
It's based out of India, but they fly everywhere. 
Great. 
Maybe they got a flight out of here to Vegas tonight. 
Who came in these? 
Other Others? 
Don't look at me. 
My question is, when are they coming back? 
Let's not wait to find out. 
This plan sounded a hell of a lot better when we were going by motorboat. 
How far is this place? 
It's around that point. 
Not more than a couple hours. 
Oh, joy. 
You all right? 
I saw Kate. 
What? 
Last night, in the jungle. 
Before the last flash. 
She was delivering Claire's baby. 
But that was two months ago. 
Time travel's a bitch. 
Get down! 
Paddle! 
I think they want their boat back! Move! 
Are these your people? 
! No! 
Are they yours? 
! Shut up and keeping paddling! 
Little help! Little help! 
Paddle harder! 
They're getting closer! 
Thank you, lord! 
I take that back! 
Everybody, paddle! Head for the shore! 
Kate, just because the guy told you that he was meeting his client doesn't mean that they're here in L.A. 
He could've just told you that to-to throw you off. 
Or they're in that hotel right now. 
Okay. 
And what if they are? 
What if the person who wants to take Aaron is sitting in that hotel room right now? 
Then what? 
Come on. 
Come with me. 
We'll - we'll go get Aaron, we'll put our heads together, and we'll figure something out. 
All right. 
Oh, my God. 
It's Claire's mother. 
Wait. 
- What am I waiting for, Jack? 
- Wait. 
I just... 
Let's just think about this for a minute. 
- She knows. 
- Maybe she doesn't know. 
No, but she knows about Aaron, and that's all that matters. 
Let me go talk to her. 
What? 
If I can just explain to her why we did it, maybe if I can get her to understand why... 
She'll listen to me. 
I can fix this, Kate. I can fix it. 
Aaron is my family, too. 
Dr. Shephard? 
Hello, Ms. Littleton. 
Um... May I come in? 
Of course. 
You look drenched. 
No, no. 
No, I'm fine. 
God, I haven't seen you since your father's funeral. 
How did you even know I was here? 
I knew you were here, Ms. Littleton, because I followed your lawyer. 
Why would you do that? 
I'm - I did it because, um... 
I understand that you feel the need to do this. 
But I need you to know that everything that Kate and I have done... it was for Aaron. 
Who's... Aaron? 
I - I'm afraid I'm not following you. 
Ms. Littleton, um... 
What are you doing here in Los Angeles? 
Let's go. 
Drive. 
Then call Sun and tell her to bring Aaron to the Long Beach Marina. 
- We'll meet her there. 
- What-wh-what are you talking about? 
- What happened? 
- Kate, we have to go now. 
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what just happened. 
She doesn't know anything. 
What? 
She doesn't know. 
She still thinks that Claire is dead. 
She doesn't even know that Aaron exists. 
But the lawyer...? 
She sued Oceanic, and she's in town to pick up her settlement. 
What, and it's just a coincidence that her lawyer happens to be the same one that's trying to take my son? 
I don't know. 
But whoever's trying to take Aaron... 
It's not her. 
Then who is it? 
Can I ask you something? 
Why'd you take it upon yourself to rescue Hugo? 
I had to make sure Hurley was safe. 
You can pull in over here. 
Mr. Linus. 
Mr. Norton. 
I looked into it, and they don't have any kind of solid case against Reyes. 
The M.E. said that the man found outside 
Santa Rosa was killed before Reyes escaped. 
That's very good news. 
We have a prelim hearing in the morning. 
The judge will never let it get past that, and Reyes will be a free man. 
Thank you, Dan. 
Anytime. 
Who was that? 
That's my lawyer. 
Remind me never to do that again. 
Where are we? 
It's hard to say till it gets light. 
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation. 
What conversation was that? 
The one before they started shooting at us, where you were about to tell me how it felt to see Kate again. 
I wasn't about to tell you anything. 
Why don't you tell me now? 
I was close enough to touch her. 
If I'd wanted to, I could've... stood right up and talked to her. 
Why didn't you? 
What's done is done. 
Juliet? 
What's wrong? 
Come and look at this! 
It's wreckage. 
Looks like it just happened. 
Anybody speak French? 
Jack, why did you call me today? 
I told you. 
I was... 
I was worried. 
But why? 
Why were you worried? 
Why today? 
I don't... 
Right before I called you, Sayid was attacked. 
And the guy that did it... your address was in his pocket. 
Sayid? 
What's he doing here? 
That's not important right now. 
What matters is that we get you and Aaron someplace safe. 
Safe from who? 
Hello, Kate. 
It's okay. 
He's with me. 
He's with you? 
I know this is gonna be hard to understand, but he's here to help us. 
To help everyone that we left behind. 
We all need to be together again. It's him. 
What? 
It's him. 
He's the one who's trying to take Aaron. 
- No. 
No. You - you don't understand. 
- No, Jack. She's right. 
It was me. 
Sorry. 
Who the hell do you think you are? 
Why don't you just stay away? 
! Why don't you leave me and my son alone? 
! Because he's not your son, Kate. 
No understand. 
You speak English? 
A little. 
Are you okay? 
Yes. 
How did you get here? 
Boat. Who is he? What does he say 
What boat? 
It's gone. 
Sink. 
It must've been caught in the same storm as ours. 
Who are you? 
How long you in the water? 
I don't know. 
How do you not know how you wound up in the middle of the ocean, huh? 
Thank you. 
What is your name? 
Jin. 
Hello, Jin. 
I'm Danielle. 
Danielle Rousseau.

Wanna hear something crazy? 
What's that? 
Did you see the big guy when we got on in L.A.? 
Sitting in first class, curly hair, guitar case? 
What about him? 
He's one of the Oceanic Six. 
Guy's got nerves of steel, man. 
He survives a full-on commercial airliner crash. 
Now he's back flying over the same South Pacific? 
Yeah, well... Maybe he doesn't believe that lightning will strike twice in the same place. 
You all right there, Frank? 
I'm just fine. 
Dude... You might wanna fasten your seat belt. 
Oh, no. 
What? 
Autopilot off! 
I got the controls. 
Autopilot off. You have the controls. 
Pull that rudder! 
What? 
- Stall. 
Stall. - We've lost power! 
Stall. Restarting one. 
Restarting two. 
Altimeter reads 650. 
Oh, my God. 
Give me more power! I can pull us out of this! 
- You're gonna rip us apart! 
- Do it! 
Is that a runway? 
Massive instrument failure! 
We're puttin' her down! Mayday! Mayday! 
Mayday! 50... 60... 
Full flaps! Gear down! 
Airspeed 190! 
Reverse thrusters! 
We're runnin' out! We're runnin' out! 
Hold on! Brace for impact! 
Hey. Hey, lady. 
Are you okay? 
Jarrah? No. My name is Caesar. 
We had an accident. 
But we're okay now. 
Frank? 
Sun. You all right? 
Oh, my God. What happened? 
! I don't know. 
Where's everyone else? Jack and... Kate and Hurley, where'd they go? 
They're gone. 
Gone? Gone where? 
You're alive. 
Dude! I can't believe it! Oh! 
Oh! Easy on the ribs there, Kong. 
" Kong." 
I actually missed that. 
I missed you, too, Hugo. 
Sawyer. 
Doc. 
Good to see you, Kate. You, too, James. 
You're really here. 
Son of a bitch actually did it! 
Locke said he was gonna bring you back, but... 
Where is he? 
John's dead. 
Dead? 
How? 
Doesn't matter. He's gone. 
So what's up with you guys and the old Dharma jumpsuits? 
You didn't tell' em? No. 
I was waiting for you. 
Tell us what? 
We're in the Dharma Initiative. 
They came back to the island? 
No. We came back. 
And so did you. 
It's 1977. 
Uh... What? 
Lost S05E09" Namaste" 
So you're telling me that you've been here, living with the Dharma Initiative for the past three years? 
That's right. 
How long's it been for you since the chopper? 
Three years. 
Hey, Jin, this is Miles. 
Where are you? Over. 
If I don't report in soon, they'll send out a patrol. 
What should we do with them? 
Dude, your English is awesome. 
What we do is we bring' em in. 
- Bring us in where? - Back to the barracks at Dharmaville. 
You can't be wandering around in the jungle with the hostiles. 
" The hostiles"? 
The Others. 
What about everyone else from the plane? They could still be out there. 
What do you mean, everyone else? 
We didn't come back alone. 
Lapidus... and Sun. 
Jin! Hold up! 
- Where you goin'? ! - The Flame. 
And if a plane landed on the island, Radzinsky will know. 
Hold on! We gotta think about this! 
All right. That's it. 
Listen, you guys gotta stay put. 
Don't go nowhere, don't do nothing till I can figure out how the hell to explain where you came from. 
Sawyer, wait. 
Other than you and Jin, who else is still here? 
Miles, have you seen James? 
Nope. 
He's not answering his walkie, either. 
Jin called him this morning, then he just ran off without telling me what was going on. 
Well, let's see what we've got. 
Hang on. There he is. 
Hey. You seen my baggy sweatshirt, the one with the bulldog on it? 
It's in the laundry. 
James... What's going on? 
They're back. 
I'm sorry. Who's back? 
Jack, Hurley, Kate. 
What? 
I know. 
They came back, Juliet. 
Are they here now? 
They're out at the north point, 
Waitin' for me to tell' em what to do. 
How did they get... 
I'm not sure. They said they were on a plane. 
I don't understand it any more than you do. 
But they're here, and I gotta find a way to bring' em in before somebody else finds' em and they screw up everything we got here. 
There's, um, a sub coming in this afternoon. 
Hey, you understand the concept of knocking? 
Oh, get your hands off that! 
I thought you learned English. 
I said, hands off! Nobody handles any of the gear in this station except me. 
Understand? I need to check the radar logs. 
For what? 
Please. I need to know if a plane landed on the island. 
If a plane landed? 
Yes. 
What, so you think if a plane landed on our island, I'd be over there just building my model? 
That I wouldn't have called anyone? That I wouldn't have put out an alert? 
Maybe you missed it. 
Can you check with the other stations? 
I just told you I would not be- - 
Check with the other stations. 
Attention all stations, this is a system-wide broadcast from Radzinsky at the Flame. 
I'm checking in to see if anyone's seen an airplane over the island. 
No one else has seen an airplane, but if you have, could you call in to me, please? Over. 
So what are you all hot and bothered about, Kwon? 
Why is this plane so damn important? 
It just is. 
Did you lose someone? Excuse me? 
I just saw you looking around. 
I thought maybe you lost someone on the plane. 
No. 
I was traveling alone. Can I get erybody's attention? 
Everybody, please! 
Listen up, folks! Here's where we're at. 
The radio's dead, so I haven't been able to call in our situation. 
But that's all right. Soon as they figure out we're not where we're supposed to be, they'll come looking for us. 
So best thing to do right now is just stick together. 
Stick together, hunker down and just wait till help gets here. 
And where is here? 
- What's that? 
- Where is here? What is this place? 
I don't know where" here" is because this island's not on my charts. 
Really? 
Really. 
Because there are some buildings over there... and animal cages. 
Down the beach, you can see a bigger island across the water. 
So maybe you should get some new charts. 
Right now, I'm just trying to keep everyone here safe. 
So let's gather up some firewood. 
If he wants to wait, let him! 
I say we search these buildings! 
Maybe they have a radio or some food! 
Who wants to help me? ! 
Why are you following me? 
Where are you going? 
Back to our island. 
You wanna come? 
Juliet? 
Hey, Amy. 
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. 
Oh, no, it's fine. 
I just came to get the sub manifest. 
Obviously, I don't want you working today. 
Thank you. 
- Full load? 
- Almost. 
Two of the recruits dropped out in the eleventh hour. 
They didn't want to take the sedative for the trip. 
- Can you tell Pierre for me? 
Hi. Oh, hello, little one. 
Have you and Horace decided on a name? Yeah, we have. 
We're gonna name him Ethan. 
When are you and Jim gonna have one of these? 
I don't know. 
Timing's gotta be right. 
So the woman who told you how to come back... did she mention that it would be 30 years ago? 
No. No, she left that part out. 
So what are we supposed to do now? 
I'm not sure yet. 
Sawyer's back! 
All right, listen. 
Y'all are gonna be the second batch of recruits comin' in off the sub pulling' into port right about now, so we ain't got much time. 
Nice suit, doc. 
Not exactly island wear. 
Try this. You want us to say we came in on the sub. 
How's that gonna work? 
Everyone gets knocked out before the trip, so no one meets each other until we process' em. 
Look, we need to find the rest of the people from the plane. 
If there was a plane, Jin will find it. 
So we got about ten minutes to make intake, or y'all are gonna be camping in the jungle for a long time. 
There ain't another batch of recruits due in for six months. 
What do you think? 
I think we should listen to Sawyer. 
- I vote for not camping. 
- Trust me. 
Do what I say. Everything will be fine. 
Let's move. 
I just heard from the Looking Glass. They were the last station to check in. 
They got nothing but an incoming sub. 
Why don't you go home, and I'll call you if something happens? 
Move. Out of my way. 
- Those bastards. 
- What do you see? Grid 325. Motion sensor alarm was tripped. 
We got a hostile inside the perimeter. 
Hey! Where you going? 
Stop right there! 
Sayid? 
Jin? 
Where's Sun? 
I don't know. 
Shut up! 
Get down! 
Say another word, and you're dead. 
Okay, so it's 1977. 
Yep. 
And... you guys are all members of the Dharma Initiative. 
Yep. 
Well, you do realize those dudes get wiped out, right? 
I mean, I saw the pit where all the bodies got dumped. 
- What about it? - Well, aren't you gonna warn' em? Aren't you gonna stop it from happening? 
I ain't here to play Nostradamus to these people. 
Besides, Faraday's got some interesting theories on what we can and can't do here. 
Did you say Faraday? 
He's here? 
Not anymore. 
... Recruits will be going inside for processing, where you'll be given your work assignment and lodging. 
Put these on and listen up. 
Juliet's got it worked out so your name's gonna be on the list, all right? 
So when you get in there, just watch the little meet and greet video, wait for' em to call your name. 
When they do, just smile, step up, take your jumpsuits and work assignments. 
Work assignments? 
Yeah, don't worry. I got it covered. 
Just remember to act a little doped up,'cause you just woke up from the sub. 
What if they start asking us questions we can't answer, - like, uh, who's president in 1977? 
- It's not a damn game show, Hugo. 
Besides, I'm gonna be in there to get your backs, all right? 
Let's move. 
LaFleur! 
Where have you been? 
What - what the hell are they doing here? 
They're our new inductees. 
I'll explain everything later. 
Stop staring and tell me what your damn problem is. 
It's, uh... It's Jin. There's a fourteen-J at the Flame. 
What? 
Jin, you there? 
James, we have a problem. 
We found a hostile. 
What? ! 
What do you mean you found a hostile? 
He was wandering in the jungle. 
- Radzinksy's taking care of him now. 
- What's he doing in our territory? 
It's a violation of the truce. 
It's Sayid. 
What? 
! Son of a bitch! 
Was anyone else with him? No. 
He was alone. 
Wait! 
I'm sorry, Sun, but waiting doesn't interest me much right now. 
There are three outriggers near here. 
I'm gonna take one. 
So you can come along and help me row... or you can stay here. 
Frankly, it make no difference to me. 
- Why are you leaving? 
- Why are you staying? 
The main island... is that where Jin is? 
Honestly, I don't know. 
But that's where I'd start looking. 
Sun! 
Over here! 
Hello, Frank. 
You all right? 
Yes, I'm fine. 
I got worried when I couldn't find you. 
I saw him leaving. 
What are you doing out here? 
Ben knows where there's a boat. 
I'm going back to the main island with him. 
You don't think you can really trust this guy, do you? 
I have to trust him. 
You ready? 
Yes. 
Sun. 
I want you to think about this, okay? 
This guy is dangerous. Sun, that boat I came here on... It was filled with commandos whose only mission was to get him. 
And how'd that work out for everyone? 
Don't do it. 
Why don't you come with us? 
I can't. I got a group of people I gotta look after. 
That's right, Frank. 
A captain's first responsibility is to his passengers. 
But I have people I have to take care of, too. 
There's a small dock about a half mile due south across the water. 
It leads directly to a town where I used to live. 
There are resources there. 
So if anyone can help you and the rest of the plane get out of here safely, it- - 
I thought you trusted this guy. 
I lied. 
Welcome to the island. 
For your own comfort and safety, we ask that you stay within the confines of your new living quarters. 
Our barracks are surrounded by a high frequency sonar fence to protect us from the island's abundant and diverse wildlife. 
How are we gonna do this? 
Shephard? Jack Shephard? 
Here we go. 
Hey, Jack. Have a seat. 
Of course it isn't here. 
- What's that? 
- Your file. 
Could they be any more disorganized on the other side? 
Sorry. 
Namaste. I'm Pierre Chang. 
Welcome to the Dharma Initiative. 
How was your ride in? 
It was fine. 
Good. Who was your shuttle driver? 
I'm sorry? 
The shuttle from the sub. Who was your driver? Oh, that was, uh... 
Um... 
Mr. LaFleur. 
Ah, yes. Good man, LaFleur. 
Runs a very tight operation. 
I'm sorry for the disorganization. 
The woman who was supposed to be processing you in had a baby last night. 
I got pulled out of my lab. I... 
Ah, here it is... Your job assignment. 
You've been assigned to the Shed. 
" Workman." What does- - what does that mean? 
Based on your aptitude test, you'll be doing janitorial work. 
- Hey there, ma'am. - Hi. - They haven't called you yet? 
- No. Not yet. 
What's your name? 
Kate... 
Austen. Austen. 
You're not on my list, and you're not on the sub manifest either. 
Who's your recruiter? 
Um... Hold on, Phil. 
I just got the new list from Amy. 
Some, uh, last-minute additions, including... 
Miss Austen? 
All righty then. 
She's all yours. 
I'm sorry for the mix-up. 
I'm Juliet. 
Kate. 
Hi, Kate. Welcome to the island. 
What the hell happened? 
Sayid just came walking out of the jungle in handcuffs alone. 
What? Did he say anything about the plane they were on? 
No, I couldn't talk to him. 
Radzinsky thinks he's a hostile. - He won't leave us alone. 
- I got this. 
- Where is he? 
- Locked in the storage room. 
Give me the key. 
You need to know, LaFleur- - he saw the model of the Swan, and he could've seen the survey of where we're building it. 
- Your point is? 
- He's a spy. 
This whole thing is an act, and we either play into it or we don't. 
We can end this right now. 
What the hell are you talking about, Radzinsky? 
We shoot him. 
Well, I appreciate your input there, quick draw. But I wanna talk to him first. 
Give me the damn keys. 
My name's LaFleur. I'm head of security. 
I want you to listen real carefully to what I got to say. And if you do that, you'll be fine. 
Understand? 
All right, let's start simple. Identify yourself as a hostile. 
The terms of the truce say you gotta identify yourself as a hostile, or we got the right to shoot you. 
We do not refer to ourselves as" hostile," 
but yes, I - I am one of them. 
All right. Good. Now we can proceed like a couple of gentlemen. 
All right, let's go. Just taking him back to the barracks. 
Oh, if you're taking him in, then I'm coming with you. 
This is a horrible mistake. 
I'm gonna talk directly to Horace about this. 
Fine. Talk away. 
You wanna remind me why the hell we're doing this? 
Ben said if my husband is on the island, the best place to start looking for him is here. 
Oh, I see, that's some advice you took before you whacked him in the head. 
Tell me you saw that. 
Probably just an animal. 
Animal. Right. 
I'm sorry to say, Sun, but... I don't think we're gonna find your husband here. 
Maybe we oughta just head back. 
Hello. 
Who the hell are you? 
My name's Christian. 
I'm looking for my husband. 
His name is Jin Kwon. 
Do you know where he is? 
Follow me. 
What is this place? 
'72...'76,' 78... 
Where is my husband? Here we go.' 77. 
He's, uh... 
He's with your friends. 
What are you talking about? What friends? 
I'm sorry, but you have a bit of a journey ahead of you. 
Okay, ready? 
Everybody say," namaste!" 
Namaste. 
Nama-what? 
Okay. 
Right on. So you guys have the rest of the day to get acquainted with your security protocol handbooks waitin' in your new digs. 
Now some of it may seem a little scary, but I promise you all, we are perfectly safe here, okay? 
So make yourselves at home. 
Come on. We got hamburgers. 
We got punch. You there, Phil? 
- We're coming in with a fourteen-J. 
Okay, if I could get everyone to hold back, please, we have a minor security situation. 
Move. 
I guess we found Sayid. 
All right, you can hang out here until we can figure out 
- what the hell to do with you. - What are we gonna do with him? 
Bring the man some damn food. 
We're not savages. 
Ah, excuse me. Um... Could you tell me where James LaFleur lives? 
Uh, that's his house right there. 
Thanks. 
But I wouldn't call him" James." 
He hates it. 
Hey, Jack. 
I saw you earlier today when you were helping Kate, and I wanted to say something to you then, but... 
We're not supposed to know each other. 
I was looking for Sawyer. 
- I guess I came to the wrong house. 
- No. Come in. 
Evening, doc. 
Well, I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about. 
Take a load off. 
You want a beer? No. 
No, I'm fine. 
What can I do for you, Jack? 
I don't even know where to start. 
Uh... 
I had no choice. 
He was running around in the jungle, got caught by my people. 
And seein' as how he can't tell the truth about how he got here, - I had to improvise. 
- Improvise? Uh-huh. 
And for now, Sayid is safe, which is all that matters. 
So where do we go from here? 
I'm working on it. 
Really? Because it looked to me like you were reading a book. 
I heard once Winston Churchill read a book every night, Even during the Blitz. 
He said it made him think better. 
It's how I like to run things. 
I think. 
I'm sure that doesn't mean that much to you,'cause back when you were calling the shots, you pretty much just reacted. 
See, you didn't think, Jack, and as I recall, a lot of people ended up dead. 
I got us off the island. 
But here you are... Right back where you started. 
So I'm gonna go back to reading my book, and I'm gonna think,'cause that's how I saved your ass today. 
And that's how I'm gonna save Sayid's tomorrow. 
All you gotta do is go home, get a good night's rest. 
Let me do what I do. 
Now ain't that a relief? 
Yeah. 
Hey, Phil. 
I'm just gonna go in there and deliver him a sandwich. 
Hello. 
I brought you a sandwich. 
I didn't put mustard on it, but if you'd like some, I could get some. 
This will be fine. Thank you. 
Are you a hostile? 
Do you think I am? 
Sayid. 
What's yours? 
I'm Ben. 
It's nice to meet you, Ben. 
subtitle made by LeapinLar and rogard 
Previously, on Fringe... 
We have evidence that indicates 
William Bell may be involved with several biological attacks. 
I will turn this world over looking for him. 
William Bell is not in this world. 
I've been waiting for this. 
Who are you? 
- I'm William Bell. 
- Where am I? 
You were missing from your car for at least an hour before you came crashing back through the windshield. 
He told me something. 
Who? 
I don't know, I can't remember. But it was very important. 
There's something that I have to do. 
Walter thinks... he was a shape-changing soldier from another universe. 
Charlie, what if I don't want to remember? 
Mind if we speed things up, Kurt? 
I'd hate for these popsicles to melt. 
I don't think we have to worry about that. 
Cargo is secure. 
Who is this guy? 
Hey, I was wondering if I could get some directions. 
What are you doing here? You're trespassing, pal. 
Why don't you get in your car and turn around? 
Yeah, sure. 
Oh, my God! 
Son of a bitch! 
- Anyone else in the warehouse? - That's it. 
The keys are in his pocket. 
Let me know if he's in there. 
You know where to reach - 
100, Walter. 
Almost. 
50 more chops. 
- Agent Dunham. 
- Walter, hey. 
So, you said you wanted to see me. 
Oh, I had an idea. 
I think I may be able to help you retrieve your memories from the accident, when you disappeared from the automobile in New York. 
- I remember that bit. 
Of course you do. 
Walter, I thought that we agreed that this was a stupid idea. 
No, you decided. 
I still maintain that the principle is perfectly sound. 
He wants you to eat worms. 
Not just worms, flatworms! 
The thing is, Agent Dunham, 
I recalled an experiment that Belly and I did w - where we trained a handful of flatworms to respond to light. 
We then crushed them up and fed them to other worms. 
It was Belly's idea. 
Because who wouldn't think to do that? 
The point is that these other worms, without having been trained, began to respond to light. 
It seems the first worms transferred their memories to the other worms through ingestion. 
Right, but that still has nothing to do with stimulating Agent Dunham's memory. 
How will we know unless we try? 
That's why it's called an experiment, Peter. Thanks. 
I know what an experiment is. - If Archimedes never decided to take a bath - - Uh, guys? 
Astrid, water. 
I was going to mix it with strawberries. 
Bishop's deli. 
This is what we know so far. 
Facility manager arrived to work this morning at 6 : 30, saw the bodies and called it in to the local P.D. 
So the robbery took place in the middle of the night. 
That makes three cryogenic facilities in a week, same M.O. as Chicago and New York. 
Yeah, but chicago was a straight" B" and" E." 
But in all three cases, the target was the same. Frozen heads. 
Which does bring up several obvious questions - First of which, what the hell for? 
Police recovered ten shell casings from a nine millimeter. 
Looks like a single perp rolled up and dropped four men, two of whom were armed. 
Excuse me. Can I see the body that's bleeding silver now? 
Fascinating. 
Walter. 
Perfect, son. 
It has the consistency of mercury. 
These robberies are obviously connected. 
We should pull the files on New York and Chicago. 
I'll make some calls, tell the local agents that we're taking over the investigations. 
Yes, sir. 
You okay? Uh, yeah. 
So, um, what does Walter think? 
Meet Mr. Silver-Blood. 
Walter thinks it's actually mercury. 
Mercury? 
Agent Francis, hello. 
Hey. 
You all right? 
You look pale. Yeah. 
I didn't get much sleep last night. Oh. 
I may be able to help you with that. 
A little cannabis before bedtime does wonders, huh? 
I recognize this. 
This is the device the shape-shifter used. 
You look like hell. 
That was, uh... That was sloppy. 
You killed four men last night, including one of our own. 
There's nothing to link him to us. Maybe not, but now the FBI - 
They have him. 
They understand what he is. 
You've been in this body too long. You're dying. 
You need to get back home and get fitted with a new conversion device. 
I'd let you use mine... but what would be the point? 
Yeah. It wouldn't do anything anyway. 
You've asked for extraction. 
They say not until the mission is done. 
They're real sweethearts. Damn. 
That's the last one. He's not here. 
There's another facility in North Carolina. 
I have another idea. 
Olivia Dunham is starting to remember her time on the other side. 
I'm thinking she may know where it's hidden. 
His head? Yeah. 
What makes you think that? 
If Bell knows that we're looking for it, it seemed like a likely reason why he'd bring her over to the other side. 
Well, if you're right, and you don't want that body to be your last, 
then I suggest you do whatever it takes to make her remember. 
Why? 
Why... 
Why are shape-shifting soldiers from another universe stealing frozen heads? 
The most likely explanation that we can think of is that they're looking for a specific head, but they don't know where it is. 
Okay. Then who? 
We don't know. 
These facilities pride themselves on secrecy. 
So despite the thefts, none of them have been willing to give up their client lists. 
What about the other device, the one we found a few weeks ago? 
Did it give any indication who these people are? 
Unfortunately, the other device is broken. 
We asked Massive Dynamic to see what they could make of it, but apparently they've been stumped. 
Well, this one doesn't appear to be damaged. 
So maybe Peter can figure something out. 
I suppose he knows a guy? 
He knew enough about engineering to fake his way into M.I.T. 
Well, let me know if you learn anything. In the meantime, 
I'm considering giving you a protective detail. 
A protective detail? 
Why? 
The last time Peter showed me one of these devices, its owner had just tried to kill you. 
I'm not worried,'cause that was six weeks ago. 
So if a shape-shifting assassin wanted me dead... then I would be. 
Let's see how this thing operates. 
What are you saying, this is not a person? 
My dear, I'm not certain that you're not simply a figment of my imagination. 
No, this is certainly not human, rather a highly advanced technology - 
A mechano / organic hybrid. 
I suspect that they produce or possibly ingest the mercury and that it controls the tissue, instructing it to take and maintain shapes. 
What? 
We have to call Agent Dunham. 
I need to talk to her right away. Okay. 
You know what this reminds me of? 
Did you ever see that movie Invasion of the Body Snatchers? 
Which version - 
Don Siegel or Philip Kaufman? 
The remake. 
I remember when I saw that movie, 
I was so scared, I didn't sleep for a week. 
I was convinced that if I fell asleep, 
I was gonna be replaced by a pod person. 
Is this your way of trying to ask me if I'm scared? 
No, of course not. 
I mean, I figure if you were scared, you'd tell me, right? 
Besides, I figure between the two of us, you're the one that carries the gun. 
What the hell? 
- What is it? 
- I'm not sure. 
I was just trying to turn it on, but... 
Looks like this thing is streaming data... and lots of it. 
I've got good news and bad news. 
The bad news is that the shape-shifter's blood is 47 % mercury. 
Which means? 
Well, I'm not sure, but I went back and re-examined the autopsy reports for the first shape-shifter. 
- And... her blood sample is perfectly normal - 
Just traces of mercury, which would suggest that, despite what we thought back then - 
She wasn't a shape-shifter at all. 
I'm afraid so. 
So the shape-shifter is still alive, which means by now, it could be disguised as anyone. 
And you could still be in danger. 
Would you like to hear the good news now? 
I think I may know how to find him. 
Rebecca Kibner. 
You showed us this. 
The girl you experimented on. 
Yes, to see things others could not. 
Oh, yes, a soldier... 
Oh, from somewhere else. 
- There. 
He's glowing, man. 
If she was able to identify the shape-shifter once, she may be able to do it again. 
He's from a place that looks like this, but it's not here. 
He's - 
He's from another universe, man. 
Hey, looks like we may have some leads on how to identify the shape-shifters. 
Walter has an idea, and I have a thought about the device. 
But in the meantime, can you check in with Broyles, see if there's something new from the crime scenes? 
Sure thing. 
Starting your own pharmacy? 
You found another one. 
Peter says this device is streaming loads of data, and he also believes it's possible that these devices store a pattern of their last victim. 
Our scientists have the same theory. 
In fact, they thought they might be able to extract an image. 
They also theorize that each device is tuned to a specific user, which suggests that since the shape-changer that tried to kill you no longer has his device, he's trapped in his current body. 
Our scientists have been working on revealing that shape-shifter's identity, but what with all the damage to the other unit - 
Well, this one is intact. 
Then let's take a look, shall we? 
So can you fix it? 
Do you understand you're asking me if I can repair a piece of technology that is entirely unlike anything that has ever existed here on Earth? 
Brandon - 
Now that I have one that works, 
I can do it in three hours... tops. 
Good, then get started right away. 
Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna head back to Boston. 
Will you call me if he gets it working? 
Oh, I can do better than that. I can set up a rendering program and patch you in... in real time. 
If you want, you can see it all for yourself. 
From a computer, from your cell phone, 
I can log you into our server. 
- Ahem. - The public one. 
The public server, of course... if it's okay with you. 
Nice house. 
Yes, it's lovely. 
Rebecca always had fine taste. 
Do you think she'll remember me? 
I think she might. 
I'm gonna guess there's not too many men in her life who have strapped her to a table and pumped her full of a massive amount of psychedelics. 
Walter, you didn't - 
What, son? 
Uh, nothing. 
Peter, wait. 
Could you do the talking? 
Please, son. 
Sure. 
Ms. Kibner? 
Hi. 
I'm Peter Bishop. 
Walter? 
Is it you? 
Hello, Rebecca. 
Oh, my God. 
Hello. 
Hi. 
Walter. 
At first, I assumed it was all just a figment of my imagination and the LSD, of course. 
But after a while, it wasn't just during the experiments. 
I would see their faces in front of me. 
They seemed to have, I don't know, a certain glow about them. 
The shape-shifters? 
Mm-hmm. It-it took me a year or two to really understand it. 
But I realized that... 
I was recognizing people that... didn't belong. 
You know, like that children's song - 
" One of These Things is Not Like the Others." 
" One of These Things is Not Like the Others. 
" One of These Things Just Doesn't Belong." 
Sesame Street. 
Yes, that's it. 
Our experiment triggered an ability to see beyond the limits of your vision. 
You gave me a great gift, Walter. 
You, uh... opened my mind for a time. 
In fact, I even tried to look you up about ten years ago, 
tried to contact Harvard, but no one knew where you were or how to reach you. 
I was - traveling. 
My father was traveling. 
Ms. Kibner, you said" for a time." 
Does that mean that the ability has faded? Not entirely, no. 
Comes and goes as it pleases. 
I just have memories. 
These people - The shape-shifters - We have reason to believe that some of them are amongst us right now. 
We were hoping that you might be able to help us identify them. 
I told you, it's-it's mostly gone. 
What if you could get it back - 
Your ability? 
You mean do the experiment again? 
Which I must advise against. 
Anytime one exposes one's brain to that amount of hallucinogens - 
Yeah, sure. 
I'll help you. 
Just a couple more. 
Actually, that one goes more on my temple. 
You're an old pro at this, huh? 
Drug-infused mystical awakenings, guided by your father, aren't exactly something you can forget. 
Hi. 
Uh, I'm Agent Olivia Dunham. 
Rebecca. 
Thank you so much for doing this. 
- Sure. - Walter, you said you wanted to start her with salvia. - We don't have any salvia. 
- Huh? You used to, um... in that cabinet on the second shelf over on the right. 
Got it. 
I don't suppose you recall where I left my slippers. 
Excuse me. 
Astrid, can you do me a favor? 
Do you think you could log onto this site from your computer? 
" Massive Dynamic." This looks like their secure FTP. 
Sure thing. 
This is the first of the psychedelics. 
Ready to begin? 
I think I've been ready for the past ten years. 
Okay. 
It's working. 
The tech must be rebuilding the image from the broken device. 
It looks like a department store mannequin. 
Okay. Now let's just load it up on my phone. 
When Belly and I first did this, we prepped her for 36 hours. 
But I'm thinking... for this type of spatial disorientation, we can reduce it to a few moments. 
Isn't that dangerous? 
More than injecting her with substantial amounts of untested, homemade psychoactive drugs? 
Astrid... Get me three syringes of phenothiazine. 
It's on the top shelf, under" A" for" Anti-Psychotics." 
And two vials of Valium... just to be safe. 
- Ready? 
- Yes, son. 
I want you to tell me if this starts to get uncomfortable, okay? 
Thank you. 
I met you once before. 
You were just a baby, but... 
I swore I saw... 
Ohh, here we go! 
I think we're ready, Walter. 
Rebecca, focus on my voice. 
What? 
Concentrate on the people who don't belong. 
You mean... the ones that change their appearance? 
There's no need to be afraid. 
You can see them... Hey, Peter. They can't see you. 
Listen to my voice. 
I'm going to take you over the threshold. 
We're walking through Johnston Gate into Harvard Yard. 
Can you see it? 
It's autumn, and it's late. 
The leaves crunch under our feet. 
Past the statue of John Harvard. 
Now we're passing University Hall, 
Memorial Church is up ahead. 
Ring. 
Walter! Hey, Walter. 
Olivia. 
Olivia! Olivia! 
Olivia. 
After all these years... it is so nice to finally see you again. 
You'll have to forgive me. 
The method by which I brought you over here was crude, and I'm sorry for that, but there were people who were trying to prevent our meeting. 
This is not at all the kind of reunion I'd always envisioned. 
The reunion that you had envisioned? 
Dr. Bell, I have been trying to meet with you for over a year. 
Please, call me William... or" Willam" if that feels warmer to you. 
Willam-that's what you always called me when you were a girl. 
How do you like your tea? 
I don't want any tea. I want answers. 
You're still a little disoriented from the time slips, aren't you? 
Happened to me when I first came here. 
You're-you're out of sync with this side. 
You're lucky. 
Most people who cross dimensions without your natural talent are simply torn apart. 
Well," lucky" isn't the word that I would choose. 
I don't know how much Walter's told you by now. 
I don't know how much he remembers. 
He told me what you two did to me when I was just a girl... 
How you conducted drug trials on young children. 
We weren't trying to hurt you, Olivia. 
We weren't trying to hurt anybody. 
Hey, guess what? 
You did. 
I've met some of the others. 
To say that they are permanently damaged would be an understatement. 
Yes. 
In any search for knowledge, there are always unintended consequences - 
Victims, you might say. 
But not you. 
I can see that... just by looking at you. 
In fact, you're just coming into your ability. 
I've seen history repeat itself enough times to know a war is coming, just as we predicted, Walter and I, years ago, and we knew that we had to prepare a guardian, someone to watch the gate. 
The gate? 
Between this side and yours. 
I would like to say" ours," 
because that's where I came from, but I'm afraid I would sound disingenuous. 
Go on. 
For reasons that will become clear in time, 
I cannot go back yet, maybe not ever. 
But now we know how difficult it is to cross over. 
I can count on my hand the number of people who've done it safely. 
But on this side, they've become more insidious. 
They have designed hybrids - 
Part organic tissue, part machine - that can do things that humans can't. 
They can change shapes, taking the form of human beings. 
Over here, they call them" the first wave." 
So you're saying that these hybrids are already on our side. 
I know it's difficult to grasp. 
Oh, I can grasp it just fine. 
I don't trust you, Dr. Bell... or William or... 
Willam... or whatever cutesy name you think might appeal to my childhood instincts. 
It won't. 
Your company has been involved in, if not directly responsible for, some of the most horrific things that I have ever seen, 
to say nothing of the fact that you just yanked me into a parallel universe to warn me about an inter-dimensional war that I believe you are responsible for starting. 
So what I want is not warmth or tea. It's the truth. 
The truth will come out. It always does. 
Livvy, you don't have to trust me. 
You don't even have to like me, but you can't deny I have a unique perspective, shaped by having lived in two worlds. 
I know the difference a wrong choice can make... or a right one. 
For example, this building is still standing because different choices were made. 
So, Livvy, if you can look past your anger, you may find that I'm more of an ally than you think. 
A storm is coming, perhaps the last and worst storm of all. 
And when it is over, I fear there will be little left of our world. 
The shape-shifters on your side are looking for someone, someone to open the door between universes, and if they find him, there will be no stopping them, 
and that is why you must find him first. 
Me? 
You are the one, Olivia. 
Of all the children that Walter and I prepared, you were the strongest. 
You were always the strongest. 
Remember this symbol. 
It's hidden on their leader. 
That's how you'll know him. 
Show this to Nina Sharp. 
She can help you. 
We're out of time. 
Olivia. 
Olivia. 
Olivia! Can you hear me? 
Astrid, nitroglycerine, 30 CCs. 
Peter, please turn the head to the side, make sure she can breathe. 
Walter, what's happening? 
I think she's receiving a flood of memories. 
It could be too much, too fast. 
You should stand. 
I think it'll be less painful that way. 
What will? 
And remember this - 
Anthropo apo ton patera toy. Tell that to Peter. 
You're going to need him by your side. 
Tell it to him. He'll know what it means. 
We have to shock her heart. 
There's a vial of adrenaline, Peter. 
And I'm afraid there's no avoiding what has to happen next. 
I pulled you out of a moving car. 
Momentum can be deferred, but it must always be paid back in full. 
Okay. 
Into her heart, between the ribs. 
Count to three : One, two... 
As I once said to Walter, physics is a bitch. 
- Three! 
- Sorry, Olivia. 
I need to speak to Nina Sharp. 
- Nina Sharp. 
- Nina, we need to talk. 
Olivia? 
Look, I'm on my way there now. 
I'm sorry. I'm just about to leave for Hong Kong. 
I have a message from William Bell. 
Cancel the plane. 
I wish I could have been more of a help to you. 
Oh, you did great. 
You sure you're all right to drive? 
Oh, she's fine. 
The injections I gave her would have counteracted any hallucinogenics in her system. 
- Peter. 
- Yeah? 
I think I'd like to drive home with her. 
You just said that all the drugs were out of her system. 
How are you gonna get back home, Walter? 
The bus. 
Okay. 
Peter, I need some money. 
He said okay. 
Terrific. 
It was a pleasure meeting you. 
You too, Peter. 
Say good-bye to Agent Dunham for me, will you? 
What? 
Oh, nothing. I... 
I'm sorry. 
It's probably just the drugs. 
Hey. 
Where is everyone? 
Uh, Peter and Dr. Bishop are out, and Olivia went to New York to see Nina Sharp. 
I can call her if you want me to. 
She just left - a few minutes - 
- No, that's okay. 
I'll talk to her when she gets back. 
What is this? 
Oh, that's Massive Dynamic. 
They're rebuilding the image from the broken device. 
Dr. Bell showed you this? Yeah. 
Have you ever seen that before-that symbol? 
No. 
Well, that's what he told me. He said it would be hidden somewhere on their leader's body. 
Well, then I suspect it would be on his head, assuming that's what the cryogenic hijackings are about. 
And that's all Dr. Bell told you? 
He said that the man with that mark... would try to open a door between our two worlds... that a storm was coming, and that the only way to stop it would be for me to find him before the shape-shifters did. 
A storm? 
Yeah. 
What? 
It was a phrase he used. 
When Dr. Bell realized the existence of the other side, the thing he dreaded most was the inevitable collision... if our two universes ever came together. 
Collision? 
The Pauli exclusion principle means that no two objects can occupy the same space at the same time. 
Dr. Bell was afraid that if the doorway between the two sides was ever opened that the unavoidable conclusion... only one world would remain. 
It's what he called the last great storm. 
Laston-Hennings Cryonics. 
I'm sorry. I have to go. 
Olivia? 
Whatever Massive Dynamic can do to help find this man, we're at your service. 
- How'd you know? 
- Listen to me carefully. 
My car's around the corner, we got a SWAT team inbound. 
As soon as I verify you're out of this building, they're gonna shred this place. 
Let's move. 
Oh, God, Charlie, I almost told her everything. 
I got to call Broyles. 
What do you mean" almost"? 
Well, I just realized where it is, the head that they're looking for. 
Bell told me. 
It's at Laston-Hennings Cryonics. 
It's me. 
Laston-Hennings Cryonics. 
What are you doing? 
Won't you come in? 
I don't think I should. 
The bus leaves every half hour, and... 
Oh, I only have 14 minutes to walk to the stop. 
Some day, huh? 
Not at all what I expected when I woke up this morning. 
That's the way of things. The best days and the worst days rarely are. 
Rebecca, what I did to you - It was wrong. 
- Oh, Walter. 
- No, no. You were young, and I took advantage, and... 
I've wanted to do that for so long. 
Oh, Walter, what you did - 
You made me... special. 
The truth is... 
I believe you were always special. 
I must go... under 12 minutes. 
You had no choice. 
If you didn't kill him, he would have killed you. 
It's not your fault. 
Whatever that thing was, it wasn't Charlie. 
They killed him for what? 
To open a door to the other side? 
And who are these people, and what do they want? 
What did we do to them? 
Laston-Hennings Cryonics was hit 15 minutes before our protective detail arrived. 
They took everything. All the cryo-capsules are gone. 
So they found who they were looking for. 
I assume so. 
William Bell pulled me to another universe... to give me a warning. 
That's how important this is. 
And I failed. 
Olivia, we'll find them. 
What's the key to being a great dad? 
That's a tough one. 
Giving them the freedom to be whatever they want to be... 
Right, exactly, and - -... Wha pilot, a president... 
Me 
And for us, what we're gonna - -... Of a company or of a country. 
Patience. 
Well, be their buddy. 
That's your answer? 
And stay in school. 
No. And don't do drugs. 
No! 
Just give me the answer. 
Oh, god. 
Still thinking. 
Hey. 
Hey. 
Hi. 
Oh, okay. 
Hi, um... 
This is my husband, phil. 
Hi. And that's my son, luke, right there. 
This is... 
Desiree. 
Desiree - - right. 
Sorry. Desiree just moved in down the block. 
Fun. 
Where? 
314. 
Oh, the two-bedroom cottage 
With the indoor / outdoor family room. 
Very good. 
How did you - - 
Bet you're loving that steam shower. 
Phil, that's creepy. 
Oh, sorry. 
[ laughs ] I'm a real-estate mogul. 
What? 
! No, I am a real-estate agent. 
Um, we caravanned that house. 
Great, uh, deck. 
Thanks. 
I'm just there till my divorce is final. 
Now, who is coconuts enough to dorce you? 
We got to go, but we'll see yoaround. 
Well, we'll have to have you over sometime. 
I'd love it. 
All right. 
Bye. 
Bye. 
She's awesome. 
No, we are never having her over. 
I heard she already slept with two dads from the school. 
What? 
Mm-hmm. That's... 
Horrible. 
Luke : 
Dad! 
Watch out. Oh, watch it, buddy. 
Grandma. 
I'm sorry. 
That still looks like a girl's bike. 
Well, we'll add more black tape. 
Phil : My son has been riding his sister's old bike. 
Until he's responsible enough To take care of his own bike. 
Look, he spilled a soda on my computer. 
He ruined our digital camera taking pictures of himself underwater. 
It's a girl's bike. 
I'm all for teaching him a lesson, 
But I worry about the ridicule he might get 
From some loudmouth bully. 
[ horn honks ] [ laughing ] hey. 
Nice bike, sally. 
Dad! 
Come on. 
He looks like little bo peep on that thing. 
Actually, not for long. 
He's getting a new bike this afternoon. 
I am? Mm-hmm. 
He is? 
Phil : Sometimes a man's gotta put his foot down 
And do what a man's gotta do. 
And if the old lady don't like it... 
Honey? 
... That's too damn bad. 
Mitchell : 
Yes! Who's excited, huh? 
Cam, come on. 
Hurry up. We're gonna be late. 
It's a toddler play class, not a flight to cabo. 
We're gonna be judged enough as the only gay parents there. 
I don't want to be the late ones, too. Wow. 
Paisley and pink. 
Was there something wrong with the fishnet tank top? 
Obviously not - - I'm wearing it underneath. 
Kidding. 
Just chill, please. 
I'm sorry. 
I just want to make a good first impression. 
You mean you want to fit in and not terrify the villagers? 
No, hey, come on. 
Today is about lily, all right? 
We - - her future best friend might be in that class, 
And I don't want to rub anyone the wrong way. 
Can you please just... 
Change your shirt? 
Fine. 
You know what? I'll just go put on a pair of khakis, maybe a polo shirt, 
And everybody will think We're a couple straight golfing buddies 
Who just decided to have a kid together. 
Hey, I called that place in napa 
And got us upgraded to a villa with a hot tub, 
So pack whatever you wear in a hot tub. 
Mwah! I usually wear nothing when I'm in a hot tub. 
Neralmente no uso nada and my college roommate's wife just had to get a new hip. 
[ laughing ] sucker. 
Manny's father is taking him for a couple of days to disneyland, 
So we're gonna go... 
To the wine country! 
We're gonna drink some wine, eat some good food. 
You know, we would do something like this a lot more often 
If it sn't for, you know, manny. 
It's good. 
He keeps us grounded. 
Yeah. 
Like fog at airport. 
Limo gets here at 4 : 00. 
This morning, I thought I'd go over to the club, hit a few balls. 
No! 
What about the fan in manny's room? 
Oh, yeah. 
Call a guy. 
No! You're supposed to do it with him. 
It's important that we teach him how to do things for himself. 
In my culture, men take great pride in doing physicalabor. 
I know. 
That's why I hire people from your culture. 
[ laughs ] You're snny! 
I'm gonna share that one with my next husband 
When we're spending all your money. 
Dad, this is the coolest bike ever. 
Awesome. 
So, listen, buddy. 
Certain members of this family 
Don't think you can take care of this bad boy. 
U mean mom? 
Your words, not mine. 
Look, uh, your mom and I are a team, 
And she - - we feel like this is a chance 
For you to show some responsibility. 
Don't make us look like jerks here. 
I won't. 
Okay. One more rule. 
What? 
Have, like, three buttloads of fun. 
Thanks, dad. 
So, let's do this. 
Okay, but I need to be done by 3 : 00. 
That's when my dad's picking me up. 
Hey, if we're not done by 3 : 00, I'm gonna tie a noose on this thing. 
Gloria : In colombia, there's a saying - - 
If you have two stubborn burros that don't like each other, 
You tie them to the same cart. 
The ceiling fan is the cart. 
My dad's takg me on space mountain. 
It's supposed to be really fast, but he's not scared of anything. 
He d't even wear a seat belt when he drives. 
Wow. How about that? 
He killed a bear once. 
Really? 
Was the bear sitting in the passenger seat? 
Read me the instructions. 
" safety tips. 
Warning. To reduce the risk of electrical shock - -" 
We can skip that. 
Uh," failure to heed these warnings 
Can lead to serious injury or death - -" 
You know, you worry too much. 
You know that. 
Nobody's gonna get shocked. 
One time, my dad was struck by lightning. 
That's why he can drink as much as he wants. 
Jay : Manny thinks his dad is like superman. 
The truth? 
He's a total flake. 
In fact, the only way he's like superman 
Is that they both landed in this country illegally. 
[ music playing ] Mitchell : I can't believe I'm so nervous. 
They're gonna love us. 
Let's just be ourselves. 
Or a slightly toned-down version of ourselves. [ scoffs ] 
I j- - I just don't want this To become an episode of" the cam show." 
Oh, my gosh, people love" the cam show." yes, I know. 
You watch" the cam show." I do watch it. It's appointment viewing. 
Okay. 
Hi! 
Hi! Are you here for toddler time? 
Yes, I-I'm mitchell, This is cameron, and this here is lily. 
Oh, well, welcome. 
We're all over here taking turns blowing bubbles. 
Oh, well, how nice for... 
The babies. 
[ chuckles ] This is gonna be really difficult. 
Phil : 10 minutes after making a promise to me, 
He leaves his bike unlocked. 
All I can hear is claire's voice in my head - - [ high-pitched ]" he's not responsible. 
You never should have given him a bike." 
[ normal voice ] I know. 
I do a pretty good claire. 
So I decided to teach him a lesson 
And let him think his bike was stolen. 
Now, I know that sounds kind of rough, 
But sometimes it's a dad's job to be the tough guy. 
Excuse me. 
Thank you. 
On your left. 
My left, your right. 
Everyone, we have a new family joining us today. 
I'm, uh, I'm mitchell, and I am a lawyer. 
I-I'm cameron, and I'm currently not working, 
Which gives me more time to grill 
And shoot baskets and - - 
And this is lily. 
Okay, we're gonna start with the hello dance, 
And then we're gonna move on to blocks and finger painting, 
And then we're gonna do our family dance. 
All right, who wants to start us off? 
Dance us in, p.J.! 
She's adorable. 
Oh, thank you. 
7 months? 
Uh, 8. 
Oh! Is she grabbing or scooting yet? 
Y-yes, absolutely. 
I mean, when she's not grabbing, 
She is - - she is scooting'. [ chuckles ] 
Danielle : Dance us in, tyler! 
[ gasps ] are you ready? 
Okay, here we go! 
Whee! Cam, lily is not grabbing or scooting yet. 
Well, she's not doing it yet, but she will eventually. 
No, a lot of these other kids, they're... 
They're grabbing. 
I-I just... 
Here, lily, look at the - - look at the block, huh? 
Grab the block, lily. Grab the" h." 
Dance us in, lily! 
Okay, I got this. 
Cam, just - - 
Yes, I know - - tamp down my natural gifts 
And dance like a straight guy. 
No slapping your own butt. 
But that's how I make my horsey go. 
Thank you. 
That was very good. 
I feel dirty. 
Oh, hey. 
Hey! Hi! 
Hi. 
Hi, uh, this is really embarrassing, 
But I locked myself out of my house. 
Oh, tsh! I do it all the time. 
Don't be embarrassed. 
[ chuckles ] I was - - I was hoping you could help me. 
There's a window open, but I can't reach it. 
Would you mind? 
Yeah, sure. 
Great. Yeah.. Of course. [ chuckles ] you know what they say - - 
Every time god closes a door, he opens a window. 
Or I guess ithis case, every time he locks you out. 
Okay, what do we got here? 
I mean, am I attracted to her? 
Yes. 
Would I ever act on it? 
No. 
No way. 
Not while my wife is still alive. 
Are you sure I can't get you something to drink? 
Yeah, no, I'm - 
- I'm fine, really. 
If I knew a man was gonna climb into my bedroom window, 
I would have cleaned up a bit. 
Are you kidding me? 
It smelled great in there, like lotions and oils. 
For... 
Dry skin and, you know, calloused hands. 
Yeah. 
It's a candle. Uh-oh. 
What's wrong? 
The bike's gone. 
Oh, no. 
Can I help you find it? 
That's all right. 
Thank you. 
Okay. 
Thank you! 
So, to teach him a lesson, I took his bike, 
And then - - crazy thing - - I put it down for one minute, 
And someone swiped it from me. 
Maybe that was your dad teaching you a lesson. 
[ chuckles ] Zinger! 
So... 
Any chance I could get a break on this one? 
I can throw in a bell. 
Deal. For $ 5. 
No, sir. 
So, you want to go for the insurance this time, Or is it still for suckers? 
Ha ha! Got me again. 
Well played, milord. 
I will take some insurance. 
Thank you. 
Gloria : What's going on in there? 
Manny : That's not step 4. 
Don't worry about it. 
Well, it says right here that - - 
That's worrying about it. 
I thought you guys might need a drink. 
Oh, you have no idea. 
Manny, mi amor, I have to go get some stuff for our trip. 
Ay, but have some fun with your father, okay? 
And I'll see you Monday. Mwah! 
Makes me so happy to see my two boys working together. 
Jay shocked himself twice. 
Okay, manny. 
Well, I warned him. 
Yep, he's been a big help. 
Look at you two with your private jokes already. 
You're a regular salazar and el oso. [ chuckles ] 
It's a very big comedy team in colombia. 
El oso is always hitting salazar in the head 
Headder and things, 
And sometimes they wear dresses. [ chuckles ] 
They make you laugh, but they also make you think. 
" you blew it. 
You made me look bad." 
No," you made your mother and I look bad. 
We are a team." Luke, you in there? 
Luke : Hey, dad. 
Hey. Hey, buddy. 
[ video game beeping ] That was, uh, that was pretty fun today, huh, 
Gettin' a new bike? 
Yeah, it was awesome. 
So, uh, what happened after I took off? 
Anything you want to share with me? 
Not really. 
So if I went out to the garage 
To take a picture for the scrapbook, 
There'd be no surprises? 
I'm so sorry. 
I didn't mean it. 
I just made a mistake. 
Yeah, a big mistake! 
You're making me look really bad here. 
I told mom you were ready for this. 
It's just a scratch, dad. 
That's not the point, luke - - what? 
I scratched it on my way into the driveway. 
I'm sorry. 
So... 
It's not stolen? 
No. 
Why? 
That's good,' cause... 
There are bad people out there who would steal a bike. 
Those are thieves. 
You sit there and think about the scratch part. 
That's not good, either. 
[ crack ] gonna fix that step. 
So don't scratch anything while I'm gone. 
Unless it itches - - that's different. The good news is, luke has his bike. 
More good news - - 
I taught some random kid a valuable lesson 
By stealing his bike. 
Best news - - claire knows nothing. 
So, I figure I'll just dump the new bike 
Where I stole the first bike. 
That way, random kid gets his back, 
And this new bike doesn't rais a lot of embarrassing questions, 
Like why I had it 
Or who boosted who through a bedroom window. 
So, everybods happy. 
Uh-oh. Oh, son of a - - 
You gave me the wrong screwdriver. 
Maybe you're just using it wrong. 
My dad's great with tools. 
He can get the wheels off a car in less than a minute. 
Just get me to wine country. Just get me to wine - - 
Ooh. 
Oh! Aah! 
Sorry. I think my arm is broken. 
Relax. 
It's not broken. 
How do you know? 
You don't know anything! 
You have no concern for safety. 
Because it didn't hit you that hard. 
Why don't you just say it? 
You don't want me around. 
You know what? 
Right now, I don't. 
I don't want to be with you, either. 
I'm gonna go wait for my dad. 
[ mockingly ] oh, but - - but if you leave, 
How will I ever finish? 
You know what? 
I wish you never married my mom. 
I hate living here. 
You think I like this arrangement? 
I got a two-seater parked in the driveway. 
[ laughs ] I mean, I don't understand. 
Why are you trying to sneak around and hide things from me? 
I actually think it's pretty funny. 
You do? 
I do, yes. 
I mean, you steal a bike from some poor kid 
And then the bike gets stolen from you - - 
That's hilarious. 
[ laughs ] classic me, right? 
Yeah! 
So, where were you when it got stolen? 
Oh, I was getting some gas. Uh-huh. Yeah. 
You don't stand near the car when you get gas? 
Yep, but, uh, I went inside 
To get a soda because I was thirsty, 
And if I had a sod I wouldn't be thirsty anymore, 
So I bought one, and then I drank it all right there, 
Which is why I don't have the can. 
Well, honey, please, 
Let's try to remember that I'm your wife, not your mom, 
So in the future, you don't need to hide things from me, okay? 
Okay. Okay. 
Ohh! Oh, yeah! 
You get back here, you! 
Claire : What are you doing, phil? 
I just love you so darn much! 
I know, I love you, too, but that hurts. 
Let's get you inside. 
It is a hot one. Hi! 
I know. That's hurting a lot. This is a hot one. 
Hello! Hi, there! 
Oh, hi! Hi, again. 
I, uh, found your bike. Uh... 
Oh, good! 
You - - the - - at the gas station? 
No, at my house. 
One of my neighbors saw it and put it in my garage 
When you were in my bedroom, so... 
Classic me? 
Come on, honey, grab the block. 
See, like did. 
You got to do that. 
You got to grab it like him. 
So, you seen any m-movies lately? 
Uh, yeah. 
You know, my husband and I just rented, uh," mamma mia," 
Which I liked, but... 
I don't know that meryl streep was the right choice. 
What did you think? 
Cameron : Excuse me - - 
Meryl streep could play batman and be the right choice. 
She's perfection, 
Whether she's divorcing kramer, whether she's wearing prada. 
Don't even get me started on" sophie's choice." 
I get emotional thinking about it. 
She couldn't forgive herself. 
[ whimpers ] I guess she was okay. 
Really? Ugh. 
Ugh, ugh, ugh. Mitchell : Grab the block, sweetheart. 
You're not even interested in it. 
Danielle : Is henry stacking? 
Good job, henry! 
Good job! 
¶ now I know my... ¶ Whoa, lily! 
Oh, not so high! Oh! 
That is a big moment for her. 
Yeah. 
Would you like a videotape? 
Uh, you know, I don't - - I don't know 
If I can actually get her to do it again, so... 
Well, we tape all of our classes. 
We don't like parents bringing cameras in. It takes them out of the moment. 
I'll get you a copy after class. That's super. Yeah. 
Thank you. 
Mitchell : 
Cam. Cam, let's go. 
I-I don't know what's happened to me, 
But I just stole a baby's intellectual property. 
What? 
You'll see it tonight on the news. 
Let's just go. 
Danielle : Oh, look who's here - - 
Anton and scott! 
Hi! Sorry we're late! 
Scott : Don't look at me - - 
The eye candy here can't leave the house 
Without spending 20 minutes in front of the mirror. [ laughter ] 
Are you kidding me? 
I am so sorry. 
Look at those queens. 
I would have killed with this crowd, 
But you had to clip my wings, 
Which you used to be the wind beneath. 
I know. 
I'm sorry. 
This class has turned me into a complete monster. 
- I just - - I'll make it up to you. 
Let's just go. 
Okay, it's time for parents dance! 
Everybody dance for your baby! 
You want to do it, don't you? 
I do. 
I want to dance for my baby. 
[ sighs ] all right, go on, get in there. 
You sure? 
Make that horsey move. Go ahead. 
Oh, I think I hurt myself. 
[ telephone rings ] [ beep ] Hello. 
Hey, javier. 
Manny's waiting for you outside. 
What? 
Why not? 
Hold that thought. 
His son's sitting on a curb, waiting to go to disneyland, 
And superman can't drag himself away from a craps table. 
And I'm the jerk. 
Say, listen... 
I, uh... 
Sorry, but I got some bad news. 
What? 
Your dad couldn't make it. 
Why not? 
The plane was full, 
And this old lady needed to get home, 
So he gave up his seat. 
You're making that up, aren't you? 
No. 
He just didn't want to come. 
Are you kidding me? 
He was very upset. 
He was dying to see you. 
In fact, look what he sent. 
A limo? 
Yeah! 
He wanted me and your mom to take you to disneyland. 
I told you he was an awesome dad. 
Yeah, he's a prince. 
Let me see... 
Okay, the key to being a good dad? 
Look, sometimes things work out just the way you want. 
Race you to the end. That is not a good idea... 
For you. 
Sometimes they don't. 
You got to hang in there... 
Because when all is said and done 90 % of being a dad - - 
Just showing up. 
Hey! 
That's my bike! 
Oh. I don't, uh... 
Well... 
I was giving it back! 
[ voice breaking ] she couldn't forgive herself. 
And... 
She had to choose. 
And I think because now I have - - 
We have - - we have l- - 
We have lily, It's so hard to imagine being put in that position. 
If I had to choose lily or mitchell, 
I mean, I would choose l- - 
I don't know! 
I just - - I don't know! 
I don't know! 
I don't know! 
Hey, i though you were gonna take out the garbage. 
I am. 
Phil. 
Yes, getting it. 
I was - - I was gonna get it. 
Dylan. 
Hey, mrs. Dunphy. 
Um, I'm just waiting for haley. 
Did you ring the bell? 
I texted. 
She said she'd be down in just a minute. 
Oh, great. 
Tell her I said hi. 
I will. 
Dylan! 
D-money! 
Chillin' with dylan the villain. 
" d" to the" y" to the - - hey, mr. 
Dunphy. 
Hey, come on in. You're just in time to catch the end of the game. 
Oh, I'm not really a baseball guy. 
[ cellphone beeps ] haley says hi. 
I-I was just being facetious. 
Come on. 
I'll catch you up. 
Sit it. 
Park it. 
Come on, I don't bite. 
[ growls ] kidding. 
[ chuckles ] I'm kidding. 
Okay, see that guy? 
He's the tying run. 
Interesting story about him. 
He's been stuck on second base forever, 
And I'm pretty sure he's gonna try and steal third, 
Which is just a terrible, terrible idea. 
How are you and haley doing? 
I wish I could stay home with you and fly toy airplanes. 
These aren't toy airplanes, manny. 
These are models, and they're very complicated. 
You want to fly one of these, 
You got to be familiar with airfoil, drag, lift, and thrust, 
And these are all principles of aerodynamics. 
The box says," 12 and up." 
What? ! 
You can fly toy planes with jay next time. 
Today you have to spend time with luke. 
Why? 
Because his mother invited you, so you go. 
Family needs to be close, right, jay? 
I'm pretty sure this is a typo. 
Men need their hobbies. 
Manny's father had many hobbies, 
Like hiking in the desert, That kind of skiing that they drop you from the... 
How do you say in english? The [ imitates helicopter ] 
Helicopter. 
Yes. 
Once, on a dare, he even boxedd with an alligator. 
Wrestle. 
You wrestle - - you can't box with alligators. 
Are you sure? 
How would they get the gloves on those lile claws? 
Aren't they like tiny, little hands? 
No! 
Okay, now I forgot what we were talking about. 
Anyways, hobbies are important for the men, 
Whether you're risking your life 
Or flying little planes from a safe distance. 
Wait, wait, wait, wait, what are you doing? 
We're just gonna buy some diapers. 
It'll just take a second. 
This is costco. 
Yeah, which is where we buy diapers. 
Since when? 
Do you remember when we adopted that baby A few months back? 
Since then. 
Mitchell is a snob. 
No, n-no, I'm - 
- I'm discerning. 
Official slogan for snobs. 
When we first met, he wouldn't even look at me 
Because I was a hick from the farm in missouri 
And he's a big city mouse. 
Who says" city mouse"? 
Country mice. 
[ baseball game plays on television ] I think I'm gonna go wait in the car. 
Okay. 
Hey, if you're on your way out, can you grab the garbage? 
I got it. 
Okay, we got it. 
He's a little jumpy. 
Oh, go figure - - a teenage boy doesn't want to hang out 
With his girlfriend's dad. 
I thought we were past all that. 
I'm all about... 
I'm all about taking it to the next level. 
Really? 
I thought you were all about keeping it real. 
Yes, but the whole point of keeping it real 
Is so you can take it to the next level. 
Did you really not know that? 
You haven't exactly taken it to the next level with my dad. 
What are you talking about? 
We've been married for 16 years, 
And you still walk on eggshells around him. 
What? 
! 
Are you kidding? 
Jay and I are total buds. 
[ doorbell rings ] You - - you want to just hang out? 
Brought six friends, so that just... [ chuckles ] 
Manny brought his favorite game to play with luke. 
It's called" empire." You use strategy to expand territories 
And take over the world. 
Luke is gonna love that. 
He's out back playing. 
Do you need me to get you something While I'm out shopping? 
That's such a nice offer, but I think we're good. 
Thanks. Okay, what about this? 
You don't even say hello to gloria and manny? 
Hi, gloria and manny. 
Okay, mom, what about this? 
No, you're wearing a dress. 
[ sighs ] mom, come on! 
What? It's gonna kill you to look like a girl for one afternoon? 
But it's a wedding for some friend of yours That I never even heard of. 
It's nonnegotiable. 
You can borrow a dress of haley's again. 
No, that sends an ugly message - - 
That I'm haley. 
You know, instead of trying to force me to wear a dress, 
Why don't you worry about getting luke to wear some pants? 
What? 
Why does he do this? 
Luke! 
Pants! Come on! 
Phil : Jay and I are buds, for sure, 
But with kind of an invisible asterisk. 
Um, he's not, uh - - he's not a talker... 
Or - - or a hugger. 
Once, he ran over my foot with his car. 
To - - to be fair, he had just given up smoking. 
But, basically, we're buds. 
Do you have to just stand there? 
You're making me feel uneasy. 
[ clears throat ] Oh, for god's sake, sit here. 
Here, hold this wing like this while I adjust this. 
Okay. 
Come on. 
Here. 
Not too hard. 
Okay. 
Alex, why don't you come shopping with me? 
Maybe I can help you find something that you like. 
That's a really nice offer, but it's not really her thing. 
Actually, I'd love to go. 
See, you don't know what my thing is. 
You have no idea what my thing is. 
I know what your thing is. 
Your thing is to provoke, 
Just like your sister's thing 
Is to never come out of her room, And your brother's thing - - 
Oh, well, there's your brother's thing. 
Luke! 
Put' em on! 
Our relationship's always been stuck 
In that primal place where it started. 
You know, he's the old silverback Protecting his females. 
Then along comes this younger, stronger gorilla, 
Swinging in, beating his chest, you know. 
Naturally, the ape ladies come running, 
Presenting their nice scarlet behinds. 
Papa ape wants to stop all that, but he can't, you know. 
That's - - that's life. 
I'm not the enemy. 
The enemy is poachers. 
That'll do it. 
Don't touch it. 
[ sighing ] all right. 
You want to go fly it? 
Sure. 
Oh, hey. 
I got the toothpaste and the soap. 
Good. Now we can open that general store. 
I thought we were just here to get diapers. 
We had a saying on the farm - - 
As long as you're bringing the mule to the market, you - - 
I feel you rolling your eyes at me. 
We met at one of pepper's legendary game nights. 
I remember mitchell because he kept rolling his eyes 
Every time I would get a little boisterous. 
I did not! 
A little bit. 
Yeah, maybe a little bit. 
We were - - we were playing charades, 
And I-I had no idea how to act out my clue, 
And all I could think of to do was... 
And without missing a beat, cam says - - 
" casablanca." 
All I did was this... 
" casablanca." 
" casablanca." 
Can we just please get the diapers and get out of here? 
Fine, but I want to stop by the wine section first. 
[ chuckling ] wait. 
There's a wine section? 
Yeah, a really good one - - just past the tires. 
No way, they do not have - - oh, my god. 
Oh, my - - cam. 
Cam. The paper shredder I wanted, huh? 
Confetti and crosscut - - yep. 
[ laughs ] ohh! 
Oh, my god, amazing. Yeah. 
Cam... 
What is this place? 
[ timer dings ] Those cookies smell like heaven. 
Your own recipe? 
No, I just throw them in the en. 
And added the secret ingredient of caring? 
Sure. 
So, you and luke having a good time? 
I don't know. 
He won't come out of his box. 
Maybe I'll just stay here and spend some time with my sister. 
Oh, right, I guess, technically, I would be your stepsister. 
My mother says we are never to use the word" step" 
Because it means" not real," And we are a real family. 
Mm. So, what is the matter, claire? 
What? 
You seem sad. 
It's just stuff with alex - - you know, kid stuff. 
Ugh, kids. You don't have to tell me. 
My school is full of them. 
I was thinking, after lunch, We can go and do a little shopping. 
I'm not getting a dress. 
I don't care. 
I'm not your mother. 
I know. 
You're my grandmother. 
Step-grandmother. 
Anyways, today, think of me as a girlfriend - - 
Two girls out for an afternoon of fun. 
What do you usually do with your girlfriends? 
I don't know. 
We go out. We talk, drink wine. 
Can I drink wine? 
No. 
Some friend. 
Well, you can still talk to me about anything. 
Yeah, adults always say that, but they don't mean it. 
When my mom says I can ask her anything, 
I really can't. 
She just freaks out. 
I won't freak out. 
Shoot. 
Okay. 
How many men have you slept with? 
Eight. 
Next. 
Now can I try it? 
No. 
I should get one of those. 
I've always loved planes. 
You know, if things had gone a little differently in my life, 
I think I would have been a pilot. 
Hey, what would happen if you turned the remote off 
And then back on real fast? 
Yeah, you would have been a great pilot. 
So, can you do a - - can you do a loop-de-loop? 
If I wanted to. 
No way! 
Can I try it? 
No. 
Okay. 
I can see why you like this. 
It's so peaceful. 
It's like the whole world just... 
Disappears out here. 
I remember this one summer - - 
I'll tell you what. 
Hmm? There's another trick called" threading the needle." 
I used to do it with claire and mitch when they were kids. 
You want to try it? 
How does it go? 
You grab one of those hoops over there 
And go to the far, far, far end of the field and stand there, 
And I fly the plane through it. 
Um, that sounds awesome! 
And then I get a chance flying it? 
No. 
Okay. 
How's this? 
Not far enough. 
Go on. 
Okay, further down. 
Está bien. Más lejos. 
You can't go too far. Right, okay. 
I get it. I get it! 
How's this? 
Good! 
Now stand still! Don't move! 
Ay! Let's do it! 
Whoo! Whoo! I love it! 
I love it! [ laughs ] 
You drove the plane into my face. 
You must have moved. 
I told you to stay still. 
I didn't move! 
Try not to talk. 
I want to make sure nothing's broken. 
[ groaning ] Alex and I can't just disagree. 
I mean, she has to turn everything into a fight. 
Hmm, a strong, independent woman. 
Sounds like somebody else I know. 
I was never hostile, thou. 
This - - this whole thing with the dress - - 
Never had this problem with haley. 
Maybe alex doesn't want to compete with her big sister. 
Maybe she's trying to create her own identity. 
Put her in a dress and she disappears. 
For one afternoon. 
I wouldn't give up being myself for even one second. 
Wow. Sometimes it's hard to remember you're only 10 years old. 
And three-quarters. 
Yeah. 
[ telephone rings ] [ clears throat ] hello? 
Olives? 
Yeah. 
You got it. 
[ beep ] Mitchell, I found the diapers. 
They're over here. 
Cameron, guess what I found. 
Coffins. 
They sell baby formula, and they sell coffins. 
You can literally buy everything you need From birth to death. 
Oh, my god, look at these diapers. 
[ gasps ] look how cheap they are! 
Oh, you know what we should do? 
We should get enough for like the next year or two, right? 
Where would we keep them? 
They sell sheds. 
Really? You want to buy a diaper shed. 
We're those guys now? 
The guys with the diaper shed? 
Just grab two more. 
I'm not grabbing two more, mitchell. 
It's time to go. 
No, come on, come on. 
We need a - - Excuse me. 
Where did you get that flatbed thing? 
Over there. 
Go grab one of those. 
Really? Yeah. 
Get two. 
I'm in the applesauce aisle! 
So, anyways, after charades, we went out for coffee, 
And I learned that he loves art, 
He plays the piano, he speaks french. 
Un peu. 
So, you know, I-I misjudged him. 
Yeah, I'm sort of like costco. 
I'm big, I'm not fancy, and I dare you to not like me. 
Yeah, and I'm kind of more like that, um... 
Oh. What is the name of that little shop we went to in paris? 
You are such a snob. 
" casablanca." 
I have a small flower on my ankle And a tiny, little butterfly on my... 
Thigh. 
How high up? 
Very high. 
Did you do it to look sexy? 
No, did you do it for a guy? 
Does grandpa like it? 
No, no, and yes. 
That's gross. 
Mm. Let's go back to your piercings. 
No, no, no. 
I've answered enough of your questions. 
Now it's your turn to answer one. 
What is it? 
Why you don't want to wear a dress? 
Because I don't want to look like haley And her stupid friends. 
I wear dresses, and I don't look like haley. 
You are haley, just... 40 years older. 
10. 
20. Deal. 
Alex, why are you fighting me on this? 
It doesn't matter if I dress up. 
I'm not pretty like haley and you. 
That's ridiculous! 
You're beautiful! 
I'm not. 
But that's okay. 
I'm the smart one. 
Hmm, the cute busboy doesn't know that you're smart. 
What? He's been smiling at you every time he comes to the table. 
He does not! 
Why do you think we are the only people with bread? 
Look, one day, you are going to want 
To date a cute guy like that. 
When that day comes, you're gonna want to look beautiful, 
And then you'll wear a dress. 
So, you ever kiss another girl? 
That's no way to talk to your grandmother. 
Was my mom hard on me growing up? 
Yeah, she was, but you know what? 
Back then, everything was betty friedan 
And gloria steinem. 
They didn't understand - - 
Gloria : Hola. 
We're back. Alex : 
Hello. Hey, how'd it go? 
It was great. 
Did you have fun with luke? 
Well, not - - we had a great time. 
Alex, I've been thinking, and... 
If you don't want to wear a dress to the wedding, It's not the end of the world. 
It's all right. 
I bought one. 
[ both laugh ] Do you see how she has to provoke me? 
We'll talk about it next week. 
[ phil groaning, pounding on door ] Jay : Clear the way. 
Coming through. Ow! Ow! 
I need to rest my face. You're fine. 
You'll be all right. 
Oh, my god! 
Dad! Little accident. 
Nothing big. 
I was in a plane crash. 
What happened? 
We were threading the needle, and somebody moved. 
No, I didn't. 
You did it on purpose. 
That's the painkiller talking. 
He's a little loopy. 
How bad is it? Well, the wing is cracked, the propeller's bent, 
But I can - - I mean phil. 
I was in a plane crash. 
Thanks, dad. 
I didn't ask him to be there. 
He insisted. He took a chance. 
This is what happened. 
Kind of like the time you ran over his foot? 
You ran over his foot? 
That was an accident. 
You know, dad, you did it on purpose. 
We all saw the tire marks on the lawn. 
I had just quit smoking. 
[ phil groans ] See, you're upsetting your husband. 
Water. 
I'll get it. 
[ sighs ] 
You okay? 
Gloria. Thank god you're here. 
Don't worry. 
I'm here, too. 
Who's this? 
Jay : Wasn't my fault. 
Oh, I have seen you thread the needle a million times. 
You never miss. 
Yeah, I must be getting old. 
Why don't you just admit it? 
You never liked phil. 
And put that down. You do not get a cookie. 
Jay : 
I like phil. It's just that sometimes he tries too hard, you know? 
And it's just kind of... 
Irritating. Okay, maybe he tries too hard Because you make zero effort with him. 
You know what? 
In the 16 years that we've been married, 
Have you one time told him that you liked him? 
Not in those exact words, no. 
No, not in any words, dad. 
How do you think that makes me feel? 
Water. You've never told your son that you love him? 
Whoa, whoa, when did we jump to" love"? 
And he's technically not my son. 
Ah. So that means that you don't love manny, either? 
Well, sure I do. 
I mean, believe me, when I was in that park, 
I really wished manny was there. 
For what - - 
So that you could fly the plane into his head? 
Huh? Dad, thanks so much for bringing phil home. 
I found one of your little flaps in his hair, so... 
Actually, this is called an aileron. 
It controls the - - Yeah,' cause that's what matters right now. 
Bye, dad. 
Hey, phil. 
Phil : Jay. 
Ow! What, are you made of china? 
[ groans ] Phil, I just want you to know, I'm sorry. 
And whether I missed or you moved - - 
I didn't. 
Either way... 
I just want to say that I like you. 
Really? 
Yeah. 
What do you like about me? 
You're a nice guy. 
You try real hard. 
I do. 
You're a good dad. 
I am a good dad. 
Come here. Come here, you. 
[ groans ] This feels so right. 
[ groans ] [ door opens ] What's going on? 
There was a little accident, 
But jay's telling phil how much he loves him. 
Oh, well, that's nice for phil. 
That's great, since he's never said anything like that to my boyfriend. 
Let it go. 
No, it's not okay. 
Mitch is right. You go in there, too, cam. 
Come on. 
You're kidding. 
Jay! 
Come on in, cam. 
A ttle hug? 
Get in here. 
[ all grunting ] 
Say it, say it! I like you, too, cam. 
What do you like about him? 
Oh, geez. Where did you get that camera? 
Only the greatest store on earth. 
Thanks, dad. 
Manny, picture. 
Get in there, too. Phil : Get in here, manny. 
[ mitchell laughs ] 
Say," cheese!" Don't push it. 
Oh, boy! Phil : Doesn't it feel like his arms could go around the world? 
I think I strained something. 
I always wanted a daughter. 
To dress her up with pretty dresses, - Do her hair, her nails, her makeup. 
[ chuckles ] No one knows this, but for the first year of his life, 
I made up manny like a girl And told everybody that he was my daughter. 
[ laughs ] But just for a few times. 
I didn't want to mess with his head. 
When he found the pictures, I told him That it was his twin sister who died, you know. 
Jay, I'm home. 
Did Manny call? 
No, because he's fine. 
It was a slumber party, not a gang fight. 
I just want him to fit in. 
I'm gonna take a shower. 
Do you care to join me? 
You know, honey, there's a gun in the footlocker in the garage. 
If I ever say no to that question, I want you to use it on me. 
Shh, shh. [ Whispers ] What's wrong? 
All down her back, back, back. Why aren't they trying to hurt each other? 
I don't know, but I'm afraid to move. 
[ Laughing ] You're really good at this. 
Thanks. 
What is happening, Claire? 
[ Mitchell ] What do you think? 
Now, that is a scone. 
No butter. Nonfat. 
Shut up. 
I'm gonna go check on Lily. 
Surprise! 
Mom! 
What's that? 
Sounds like a bird hit the window. Oh, God. 
That's a bad sign. 
Ow! 
That hurt, jerk! [ Growls ] Ow! 
I'm gonna kill you, stupid! Ow! 
What happened? 
Now I'm sad. 
Hi, honey. Mmm! Hi. 
- I didn't know you were in town. You didn't call. 
Well, I couldn't wait to see your new baby. 
Where is she? 
Mitchell, who was that? 
It's my mom. 
Oh, yeah, right,' cause the last time she was here, the refrigerator magnets rearranged themselves... into a penta 
- Grandma! 
[ Man ] ♪ Hey, hey ♪ 
♪ Hey, hey Hey, hey ♪ 
♪ Hey, hey Hey ♪ ♪ Oh. 
Mom, what are you doing to her legs? 
[ Chuckles ] 
Mitchell's mother has a problem... with me. 
Last Christmas, for example, she gave me a piece of exercise equipment and a lettuce dryer. 
So, to recap, 
I gave her a gorgeous pair of diamond earrings, and she gave me a hint. 
And living in Sedona has been transformational. 
I get up every morning, and I go to a Vortex meditation site... and work with a shaman to finally understand how to live my spirituality. 
Yikes. 
And I've learned that the only way I can move... to the next level of my awakening... is if we all can somehow... get past... the incident. 
Oh, no. 
- The incident. - Oh, boy. 
I would like to congratulate Jay and the lovely Gloria. 
I'm very happy for them. 
I wanted a big, beautiful wedding with Jay... because my ex-husband and I got married... in a tiny little office of a judge in Colombia. 
My mother wanted to go to the wedding to show everyone how okay she was with all of it, so I convinced Dad and Gloria to invite her. 
Who warned you that that was the worst idea ever? Anyone? 
Anyone? 
Oh. [ Chuckles ] 
Of course, I've-I've moved on. [ Chuckling ] 
I was supposed to come with a date, but he just hurt his back, which is very ironic because he's young and-and healthy. 
My mom started drinking... these cocktails called" Horny Colombians"... with some of Gloria's uncles, whom apparently the drink was named after. 
[ Phil ] Oh, come on. They were funny. 
They kept patting my butt. Somebody's full of herself. 
It's a 
- It's a Colombian wedding tradition, they said. [ Glass Clinking ] 
I would like to make a toast. Yeah. 
Nana got totally wasted. Uh, it was really funny. 
Then it was gross. 
To the bride and the groom - my ex. 
Thirty-five years we were together, and he couldn't wait 10 minutes to run off with Charo. 
- [ Guests Groaning ] - That's a joke. 
That's a joke. - [ Rim Shot ] 
- Seriously, I knew they were perfect for each other... when I saw his wallet and her boobs. 
[ Groaning Continues ] Take your hands off me! 
- Mom. Mom. 
- Oh, relax, Mitchell. 
What, did you take your Claire pill? 
Let's just go get a little fresh air, okay? 
No, no. And then it got weird. 
[ Mock Accent ] I'm Gloria! I'm Gloria! 
I got her. Kiss me! Oh, hey, kiss me! 
[ Grunting ] 
No! 
Nana is really strong. [ Guests Gasping ] Ayayayayay! 
During my vows to my first husband, drug dealers burst in and assassinated the judge. 
This was way worse. What can I say? 
I drive women crazy. 
[ Laughing ] 
It's too soon, I guess. 
- Everybody is going to be there, Mom! 
- I don't care. 
Your father and I are not about to let you drive two hours to go to a concert... and then spend the night with a bunch of boys, especially that 17-year-old hormone you're dating. 
- Oh, really? By whom? 
- By Spencer Patine's uncle. 
- Who's Spencer Patine? 
You know Spencer - the guy with the arm. 
Wait. What kind of arm? 
What does that even mean? 
His uncle is Uncle Toby. 
Oh, Uncle Toby. 
I'll be sure to include that in my Amber Alert. 
Oh, my God! Okay. Can I step in here? 
I think I can help. 
Haley, what your mom is worried about... is you getting your heart broken when Dylan goes off to college next year. 
He's not going to college. That's not what I'm - He's not going to college? 
He's in a band, okay? 
They're going on tour. 
Oh, this just gets better and better. 
Why are you always on me about everything? 
Because you need to understand - Okay. Everybody, calm down! 
Let's start from the beginning. 
What's wrong with Spencer's arm? 
[ Grunts ] 
Ay, baby! 
Did you have fun at the slumber party? 
You must be exhausted. No, I'm not tired at all. 
I was the first one to fall asleep. 
What's on your face? 
A smile from having such a good time with my friends. 
No. Come here. 
Oh. That's why they were laughing. 
I thought it was my funny take on current events. 
Why would they do something like that? Don't worry about it. 
Guys pull pranks like that all the time. 
You just gotta prank' em back. 
You just gotta show' em you're willing to give as good as you get. 
What do you think? 
Hmm. Revenge. 
I like it. 
Well, Mom, instead of dredging up the whole incident, maybe we should just try and repress it, like a - like a normal family. 
I can't. 
I need closure. 
I'm about to embark on a new journey. 
- I met a man. 
- Really? 
His name is Chas, and he's asked me to come live with him in his foreign land. 
- Wow. Where? 
- Canada. 
- You're moving to-to Canada? 
- French Canada. Oh. Oh. 
That's wonderful. 
It's just that when I think of all the awful things... that I said to Gloria and Jay and you and Claire, I feel such guilt. 
Give it time, and see Banff. 
Cam, please. 
I just can't give myself to him sexually. 
Okay. Mom. 
Did not see that coming. 
Don't get me wrong. 
We satisfy each other down there - Oh! 
That's why I need everyone's forgiveness. 
I need your help, Mitchell. 
Did you hear that, Mitchell? 
Your mom needs your help to make love to her new man, Chas. 
That's not weird at all. 
Mom, I - [ Chuckles ] I'm just not really sure what you're asking me to do, Mom. 
Well, everyone's mad at me. Oh - 
Maybe you could pave the way so that I can apologize. 
Well, um, you know, we are actually all supposed to have Sunday dinner tonight, so maybe I could go around and ask everyone if it's okay for you to join us. 
I knew I could count on you. Oh, my beautiful boy. 
Mmm. 
I love you so much. 
There's a fish in nature that swims around with its babies in its mouth. 
That fish would look at Mitchell's relationship with his mother... and say," That's messed up." 
Boy - [ Clears Throat ] 
Things with your mom got pretty intense down there, huh? 
All like East Coast-West Coast. You feelin' me? 
Act like a parent, talk like a peer. 
I call it" peerenting." 
I learned it from my own dad, who used to walk into my room... and say," What's up, Sweathog?" 
Honey, I would love to let you go to the concert. 
Are you kidding me? 
I think concerts are rad. 
- Hello? 
I was a Hall-Raiser. 
- A what? 
I followed Hall Oates around the country one summer. 
" Rich Girl" just spoke to me. 
I was dating this girl. Not - Not dating. 
I guess I was following her too, kind of - 
Okay, Mom just doesn't trust me, and it's not fair. 
She trusts you. 
It's just that weird stuff happens at concerts. 
- Boys get urges. - Ew. 
Dad, is there something you want? Yes, there is - to connect with this girl right here. 
Now, come on. Pretend I'm not your dad. 
We're just a couple of friends kickin' it in a juice bar. 
- What's a juice bar? 
- Okay, a malt shop. Whatever. 
Dad, I don't - No. Who's Dad? 
Who's Dad? 
I'm 
- I'm Marcus from Biology. 
Hey, Haley. 
How's it going with you and Dylan? 
Has he tried anything inappropriate with you? 
Girl. 
[ Ringing ] Hey. 
Just talking to some dork I met in a malt shop. 
What's up? Hey! 
Just in the hood. Do you 
- Do you remember how Mom gave up a career to raise us? 
Promising career. Oh, God. Claire? 
Mom. 
Why so long? 
I know, I know. It's weird when we haven't talked for a while. 
I mean your hair. 
Mmm. Mmm. Well, if I can't tell you, who will? 
[ Mouthing Words ] 
So, Mom wants you to know that she's very sorry about the incident, and-and she wants us to forgive her. 
How very nice of her to say that through you. Do you see? 
The sarcasm is so hurtful, like a whip. 
You know how growing up, we all have that voice inside our head... that tells us we're not good enough? 
Well, mine was outside my head, driving me to school. 
Uh, so - so anyway, Mom really wants to smooth everything over with Dad and Gloria. 
So I was thinking, uh, would it be okay if she maybe joined us for dinner tonight? 
Because it may be the last time you ever see me. Well - Okay. Wait, Mom. 
What are you talking about? 
Well, I'm 
- I'm moving... to a far and dangerous place. 
Canada. But, uh, she met a man named Chas. 
Yeah. He's a logger. 
Uh, like a lumberjack? 
No, he logs blood samples into a cholesterol study. 
Anyway, until I'm past this whole wedding debacle, I can't be intimate with him. 
We do things to each other. 
We use our hands. Oh, my Lord. 
Hey, Nana. 
Oh, my little comet! Hi. 
Oh, look at you. You're all grown up. 
Hmm. Tell Mom that. 
She won't even let me go to a concert. 
Overnight, with her boyfriend. 
[ Laughing ] What are you laughing at? 
Oh, karma's a funny thing, that's all. 
- Remember Ricky? - Oh, God. 
Ooh. Who's Ricky? 
[ Claire ] No one. 
Ricky was your mother's boyfriend, and he looked like Charles Manson. 
And one night, she didn't come home until 4 : 00 in the morning. 
4 : 00. Wow. Wow. 
Mom, what were you and Ricky doing? 
Nothing. 
We were doing nothing, and he was a very sweet boy, which you might have known if you bothered to get to know him. 
- Dylan's a sweet boy. - [ Scoffs ] Dylan. 
Dylan isn't Ricky. Ricky 
- Ricky was a poet. Dylan writes songs. 
Awesome songs. 
And maybe you would know that" if you bothered to get to know him." 
Ha! [ Laughing ] Okay, you know? 
First of all, I am not my mother. I don't judge people before I get a chance to know them. 
So you invite Dylan over to dinner tonight, and if he's as sweet and as kind as you say he is, then I have no problem considering letting you go to the concert, after I do a background check on Uncle Toby. 
Thank you. 
Thank you. Thank you, Mom. 
I'm gonna go call him! 
That's very revealing. 
That's my parenting style. 
- No, I meant your blouse. - Mom! 
Claire, wait. 
Come - Not making this easy. 
Claire, come on. 
Stop, stop, stop. 
Just let her come to dinner, apologize to Dad and Gloria, and she and Chas can live happily ever after. 
In Canada. In Canada. Wait. 
Why don't you make her fix this, instead of you doing it as usual? 
Whoa. What's that supposed to mean? 
Mom makes a mess, and there's Mitchell to clean it up. 
That is so not true. 
If anything, you're the one with the screwed-up relationship with Mommy - 
With Mom. Wow." Mommy"! No, I didn't say it - Damn it. 
Ooh. 
Fine. Fine. 
She can come, but she's gotta clear it with Daddy. 
" Daddy"? I did not say" Daddy." You said" Daddy." 
Hey, Dad. 
Mitchell, what are you doing here? 
Uh, I'm sorry to bother you. 
Can I talk to you and Gloria for a second? 
She's out dealing with a Manny situation. 
- He set a kid's bike on fire. 
Oh, I might have told him to get even with some kids, and he went all Rambo with it. 
Not my best parenting moment. 
[ Chuckling ] Not your worst. 
What's up? 
Uh, well, you know, uh, Mom's in town. 
Your mom? No, your mom. 
She's back from the grave. 
Yes. Yes, my mom, Dad. 
My mom would be less scary. 
Listen, she's a wreck about what happened at the wedding, and she wants to come to dinner tonight to apologize to everyone. 
Still her little errand boy, I see. 
No - Why does everybody keep saying - No. 
I 
- I'm just trying to piece this family back together. 
So, you'll talk to Gloria about Mom coming to dinner? 
Oh, Gloria would never go for that in a million years. 
She's still furious with your mother, which is why I'm not talking to you. 
What did I do? 
This conversation never took place. 
That's not very nice. 
I drove all the way here. 
You were never here. 
- You never even called. 
- I would've called, but I thought it would be better - 
What's happening here? 
Listen, I would love to get this thing behind us, but Gloria would never forgive me if I pulled a fast one on her. 
That's why you're going to pull a fast one on her, and I'm not going to like it one bit. 
Okay, that's just great. No, that's great. 
So, it's all up to me. 
I can't hear you because you're back home, and I'm taking a nap. 
D-Money! 
There he is. 
Hey. Come on in. 
Hey. Hi. 
How you doing? Good. 
Um - Uh, hey, everybody. 
This is Dylan. Hey. 
Hi, Dylan. 
He has a very gentle soul. 
You got that from" Hey"? 
So, Dylan, see you brought the ax. 
Yeah, yeah. I just came from practice. 
Sweet. 
- Miss those days. 
- Oh, you were in a band? 
Could have been, but in high school I was really all about my magic, so - 
Oh, my God. Over. [ Doorbell Ringing ] 
- Oh, that's gonna be Dad and Gloria. - Oh, Mitchell. 
I know it's silly, but I'm a little nervous. 
Oh. 
That's not silly. 
You should be. 
[ Door Opens ] Hola. 
How are you? Manny? Phil. 
Nice mustache. Thank you. 
Don't make fun. 
He may burn your house down. 
- Oh, boy. 
- Dede. 
- Hi, Jay, Gloria. 
- What is she doing here? 
What does she mean," What is she doing here?" 
- Mitchell told you I'd be here. - Lies! 
I couldn't tell her, because she wouldn't come. 
Gloria, uh, my mom wants to apologize for everything. 
So you just spring it on Gloria like this? Mitchell, what the hell is wrong with you? 
- I don't want her apologies. 
- Who could blame you, honey? 
Which is why this is a terrible idea by you! 
Jay. Manny. 
Let's go. Oh, wait, wait, Gloria. 
I 
- I just want to tell you how sorry I am for ruining your wedding. 
I was struggling with being alone. 
Meanwhile, Jay moves on so easily, and-and not with just anyone - with a... young... and smart and beautiful woman. 
I don't expect you to forgive me. 
If I were you, I'd want to punch me right in the mouth. 
I think we've had enough revenge in this family for one day. Ah. Okay. 
Yeah, we're all gonna move past this, and because of me, who's not a mama's boy, but is a caring person with wisdom and emotional insight. 
So make a note, bitches. 
It's not a good color on you. 
I forgive you. 
Oh, wow. 
I am not prepared for this. I just - 
I - I wanna rip your head off! 
What? 
Â ¡ Una loca peligrosa! 
You ruined my wedding! Oh, no! Oh! 
I got Gloria! - I got Gloria! 
- Mom, come on. - [ Gloria ] Â ¡ No! 
- Unbend your legs. 
Stand up like a big girl. Come on. 
All right. 
Stop it. Stop it. 
Stop it, the two of you. 
I am so sorry about this. 
No, it's cool. It's cool. 
This is ridiculous. 
Gloria didn't steal me, Dede, and you know it. 
We grew apart for years, and you left to find yourself, remember? 
I thought I could handle this. 
- I'm so sorry. - You don't say sorry anymore! 
That word means nothing in your mouth! 
I got Gloria. 
I don't know what just happened. 
[ Dylan ] I do. 
I mean, it seems pretty simple to me. You're reaching out, trying to hold on to something awesome. 
Um, maybe - maybe you shouldn't - 
Look, look, look. 
I'm not used to this - the whole big family thing. 
In my house, we don't even talk to each other. 
You know, it's funny - the first time I saw Haley, I knew I liked her. 
I mean, she's beautiful and everything, but it's-it's not just that. 
It's that she's got this killer confidence - you know, the kind of confidence that you get from having a family like this... that's passionate... and accepting of hot foreigners... and gay dudes and nutty people. 
You know, a family that actually loves each other. 
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but maybe we should let her go with him. 
He's perfect. 
Everybody, Haley says that Dylan is a musician, and he writes some great songs. 
Yeah. Play something, bro. 
Well, I guess so, if you want me to. 
We could all use a nice tune right now. 
This is, uh, actually a song I wrote for Haley. 
It's called" In the Moonlight." 
Lovely title, Dylan. Thanks.

Never good at harmonizing. 
That was good. 
Do we know anything? Oh, no. 
They're in there now with the doctor. 
We're lucky, though. 
The paramedics said it could've been a lot worse. 
My God, how did this even happen? 
There he is. 
Big day's coming up. 
What do you want for your birthday, big dog? It's okay. 
I'm good. 
Come on. 
The sky's the limit. 
Dream big, my boy. 
- Well, I guess I could use a belt. - A belt? 
Yeah, you're right. 
I don't need it. 
An extension cord works pretty good. 
Every year, Luke's birthday falls right around Thanksgiving, and so it gets lost in the holiday shuffle. 
Yeah, one year we forgot completely, and we had to improvise a cake out of stuffing. 
Which, by the way, he was fine with. 
He's one of those kids, you get him a gift, and all he wants to do is play with the box. 
Yeah, one year we actually just got him a box- - a really nice box. 
And we made the mistake of putting it in a gift bag. 
So he played with the gift bag. 
- W-we can't get it right. - No. 
I feel terrible. 
We got to do something. 
Oh, yeah. 
Um, well, you know, the family is gonna be together for Thanksgiving for the first time in, I don't even know how long, so- - 
I am so with you- - we should blow this out and throw Luke the best birthday party of all time. 
Yes, yes, and we'll order a whole bunch of pizzas, and- - and- - and set up an arts-and-crafts table. 
- A what? 
- Yeah, a crafts table. 
You know, everybody gathers around, and they make stuff, and, then, bam, they got their own party favor. 
Sorry, I fell asleep while you were describing the most boring party ever. 
See you in a few hours. Yeah. 
Thanks again for the karaoke machine. 
I'll get it back to you right after the party. That'd be great. 
Please don't. 
I beg you. Don't. 
Don't bring it back. 
Hey, Phil, are you getting a clown for today? 
Oh, no, Luke- - Luke's not much of a clown fan. 
- Yeah, he never liked them. 
Has he ever seen a good one? 
Has- - has anyone? 
Really? 
So, anyway, thanks again. 
Okay, yeah, see you later. 
No clown? 
No- - no clown? 
Let it go. 
Who throws a party without a clown? 
Since the late' 30s, I'd say most people. You know what? 
We haven't gotten Luke a present yet. 
Maybe a clown could be our present. 
Cameron, Cameron, if Phil and Claire wanted to get Luke a clown, they would've. 
This is not our party. - But- - 
- This is not our party. 
But- - fine. 
What would you suggest we get him, then? 
Get him a gift card. - A gift card? 
- Yeah. 
Who hurt you? 
Hey, Gloria, you got any idea how to wrap one of these things? 
Is that a crossbow? Yeah. 
Am I the greatest grandpa in the world or what? 
We can't give Luke a crossbow. 
He pokes himself in the eye every time he uses a straw. 
Are you kidding? 
I had one when I was his age. 
My dad used to give me a quarter for every crow I bagged. 
And I used to have a machete, but times have changed. He'll be fine. 
I'll teach him how to use it. 
Hey, pal. How's it going? 
- Am I charming? 
- Oh, boy. 
Of course you're charming. 
Who said you were not charming? 
No one, but there is a girl in my school, and I want her to like me. 
I need your advice, Jay. 
Really? 
She's gonna be at Luke's party. 
Well, I'm... a little thrown. 
I mean, you don't usually come to me for advice. 
Well, this is one area in which you've done pretty well. He has a point. 
I've tried everything to get her attention- - 
Opening doors, having a milk sent over in the cafeteria. 
Nothing has worked. 
Here's the deal. 
Girls don't go for all that romantic stuff. 
They go for power and success. 
And since you don't have either one of those things, you're gonna be the funny guy. 
No, no, no, no, no. 
I-I want the most dangerous reptile you've got. 
I have an iguana that eats crickets. 
That'd be scary if it was a birthday party for crickets. 
Seriously, Jungle Tanya, I need you to step it up a notch. 
Is there anything that scares the cocoa out of you? Uh, not really. 
I do have a bearded dragon. 
- Ooh. Does it- - 
- No, it does not breathe fire. 
Well, then, we're back to square one, aren't we? 
I couldn't get Luke out of my mind. 
I know I made a promise to Mitchell, but some things are bigger than promises. 
Fizbo would be at that party. 
Hello, old friend. 
It all happened so fast. 
I keep thinking there was something I could've done. 
Oh, don't blame yourself. 
Who could have possibly seen it coming? 
Sweetie, t-that's a rock wall. 
Is that even safe? 
Oh, my God. 
Honey, relax. 
Hey, has anyone ever gotten hurt on one of these things? 
I don't know, man. 
It's my first day. See? 
They wouldn't let the new guy do it if it weren't- - 
- That did not make me feel better. 
- Don't worry, I signed like a hundred releases. 
When did we decide all this? I-I think it's too much. 
See, I knew you'd say that. 
That's why I didn't tell you. 
So just relax. 
Grab a snow cone. 
- There's a snow-cone machine? - Yeah. 
Mom, just so you know, Dylan cannot have mayonnaise. 
That's random. 
Why are you telling me that? 
Uh,' cause he's coming to the party. 
Is that absolutely necessary? 
Yes, because she can't go 10 minutes without her boyfriend's tongue in her mouth. 
It's like he's feeding a baby bird. 
Don't be so jealous. 
I'm sure you'll meet someone super hot at computer camp. 
- Girls. - Hey, hey. 
So, what you got there? 
Oh, these are supplies for the crafts table. 
I finally figured out what we're gonna be making. 
Kids bored? 
I'm teasing. 
I'm teasing. 
It looks good. What- - what is it? 
Comb sheaths. 
I know, I know. 
But we made them when I was 11 years old at Donna Rigby's birthday party. 
At first, we thought it was really stupid, and then we had a blast, so... 
How could you not? 
You combined the two things that kids love the most- - 
Combs and sheaths. 
I'm kidding! 
Where's my comb? 
Oh, here it is, in my incredibly convenient beaded comb sheath that I made at Luke's awesome birthday party. 
Hole in one, Mrs. Dunphy. 
Hole in one. 
I'm home. 
I got Luke a video game, but it's about math, so... guess we're those kind of uncles. 
Cam? 
Don't be mad. 
Oh... 
Cam, I... 
I've known I wanted to be a clown since I found out clowns were just people with makeup. 
Um, as a matter of fact, by the time I was a teenager, if I wasn't in school or fishing', I was clowning'. 
There are four types of clowns- - 
A tramp, an auguste, a whiteface, and a character. 
I am a classically trained auguste clown named Fizbo. 
- What? 
- N-nothing. 
Between the clownin' and the- - the fishin', I'm surprised you had time for the schooling'. 
Oh, and there's the fifth type, the sad clown. 
The sad clown is a tramp. 
So there's still only four types. 
Okay. 
Cam, I thought we discussed this. 
We did, but I-I started thinking. 
And this isn't about you or me. 
This is about a little boy who deserves some happiness. 
And he's gonna get that from his weird gay-clown uncle? 
Fizbo is not gay, he's asexual. 
- H-he's an innocent whose only drive is to bring people joy and laughter and balloon animals. 
He's- - he's the least sexual being on Earth. Oh. 
Oh, okay, we, at least we agree on something, yeah. 
If this tape is found in the future, this is how we humans celebrated birthdays. 
Hey, Dad! 
Yeah, there's my boy, zip line extreme- - Oh! 
Ugh! 
I'm okay. 
I'm good. 
I'm good. Lesson learned. 
Don't stand- - Don't stand there. 
Let's go ahead and rope this area off. 
Excellent. Thank you. 
Hey, buddy. 
You having fun? 
Yeah, and I love my new belt. 
Hey, Luke! 
Luke, do you want to make a comb sheath? 
A what? 
It's a cool leather holder for your comb. 
And you can decorate it. 
I've got beads and- - and glitter and- - and all kinds of stuff. 
Do you want to? 
Nah, I'm gonna do the rock wall. 
Okay, honey, it's your day. 
Honey, let me know if you get low on supplies. 
I'll make a quick run back to the 1950s for you. 
Again? 
! 
Seriously, zip-line guys, just some ropes. 
Did you remember to switch the whites to the dryer? 
Oh, no, I forgot. 
They're gonna smell musty. 
I know. 
I'm sorry. 
- I'll pump. 
- No, no, no, I'll do it. 
You just stay right here and relax. 
Oh, I get it. 
You're worried about people seeing me. 
Without question. 
You know, people are gonna stare. They're not used to seeing one clown in a car. 
That's her- - Bianca Douglas. 
She's so cute. 
Yeah, and she has good handwriting. 
She's the complete package. 
Wish me luck. 
You don't need luck. 
You just remember those jokes I told you, hmm? 
- We have to stop meeting like this. 
- What? 
- We go to school together. 
- Oh, yeah. 
Do you like jokes? 
Sure. 
Great. 
Okay. 
So, a grasshopper named Gary walks into a bar. 
Oh, no. 
You're not supposed to know his name. 
Let me try another one, okay? 
- Knock, knock. 
- Who's there? 
- Interrupting cow. 
- Interrupting cow who? 
Moo. 
Oh, crap. 
- Um, hey. 
- Hey, yourself. 
Move. 
You kind of just bumped me with your car. 
I don't think so. 
No, no, you did, because, um, see, yeah, I got grease on my pants, and then also I felt it. 
Call an ambulance. 
Okay, I just thought you might want to know in case you wanted to be a decent human being and apologize, but... no? 
Okay. 
Ass. 
What did you say? 
Just forget about it, all right? 
Listen, carrot top, I didn't touch you, so do the smart thing- - 
Shut your hole, get in your car, and drive away. 
Is there a problem here? 
What the hell are you? 
I'm the ass-kicking clown that'll twist you like a balloon animal. 
I will beat your head against this bumper until the airbags deploy, so apologize to my boyfriend right now! 
Apologize- - boyfriend? 
Apologize! 
Okay. I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry. 
Let's go. 
We're gonna be late. 
Mind if I come in? 
- Sure. - All right. 
Come here. 
Why you bounce so sad? 
I told all my jokes. 
It turns out I'm not the funny guy. 
The right girl will find you when it's time, even though I'm gonna hate losing you to another woman. 
You'll never lose me, Mom. 
I'll always love you, no matter what. 
Oh. 
You see right there? 
You need no tricks. 
Just be the sweet, wonderful little boy that you are. 
Sweet little boy- - Got it. 
She won't know what hit her. 
Hey, Manny, want to make a sweet comb sheath? 
Could not be a worse time, Claire. 
Oh. 
It's so peaceful and quiet over here. 
Ha ha. 
If you came over here to gloat, I already know it's a dud. 
Actually, I came to give you this. 
It's your favorite flavor- - Blue. 
Thanks, honey. 
And your hair looks really nice. Mm, thanks. 
I've been combing it all day. 
All right, let's all give Luke a big hand for being so brave. 
It feels so weird. 
What does it eat? 
Oh, just little-boy brains. 
Well, at least luke's got nothing to worry about. 
Is there mayo in this? 
No, you're good. 
Um, so, I was thinking that maybe we could go slip away. 
So, does anyone want to pet the iguana? Hells, yes. 
Oh, man. 
I love lizards. 
What's his name? 
Her name is Lizzy. 
Wow. I totally get that. 
You don't deserve this. 
What? 
Hot reptile chick, you know, probably has her own apartment, obviously okay touching gross stuff. 
- They're just talking. 
- You're right. 
Dylan's far too sophisticated to get sucked in by a single lady with tons of cool tattoos. 
Hey. 
- I think it peed on me. 
- Oh, no. 
No way, mother nature. 
I can't believe he does that. 
Hey, what am I missing, guys? 
Aw, geez, Gloria. 
Jay, look! 
I go high! 
Look, look! 
Hey, guys, hit the road. 
Come on, you're family men. 
Come on, scat. 
Great job, buddy. 
Now comes the fun part. 
Rappel down. 
It's really high. 
You have nothing to fear but fear itself... and the concrete, but I'm right here, buddy. 
Okay, just catch me. 
I am brave. 
Roller coasters? Love them. 
Scary movies? 
I've seen" Ghostbusters" like seven times. 
I regularly drive through neighborhoods that have only recently been gentrified. 
So, yeah, I'm pretty much not afraid of anything... 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, everybody! 
Quit your clowning around. 
That's my job! 
Except clowns. 
Never shared that with the fam, so 
I do have an image to maintain. 
I am not really sure where the fear comes from. 
My mother says it's because, when I was a kid, 
I found a dead clown in the woods, but who knows? 
Hey! 
Oh! Well, you must be the birthday boy. Wow. 
Is that you, Uncle Cam? 
Well, no, I'm Fizbo the Clown. 
I don't know who this" Uncle Cam" is. 
But he sure sounds handsome, doesn't he? 
- Hey, who likes balloon animals? - I do! 
I do! 
It's just Cam. 
It's just Cam. 
You all right? 
What? 
Yeah. 
No, I just have kind of a... complicated relationship with clowns. 
Oh, well, join the club. 
Look, I came on strong with that whole funny-guy bit. 
This is me just being myself. 
Okay. Hey, do you know who that boy is over there? Oh. 
That's Dylan. 
He's Haley's boyfriend. 
He's so cute and tall. 
I'm still growing. Give me a break. 
Pardon me, miss, but this little doggy needs a new home. 
Oh, thank you. 
That's quite an impressive getup you got there. 
Well, thank you, Jay. 
Oh, by the way, you have something on your shoulder. 
That's good. 
Never mind. 
It was nothing. 
Yeah, we're done here. 
So, do you keep these at, like, a zoo or something? 
No, I just keep them at my place. 
That's awesome. 
I only have a cat. Yeah? 
I used to have a cat. 
I was just messing with you before, but, seriously, he's still talking to her? 
On it. 
You know, this is one of- - 
I feel like Britney Spears. 
You're so funny. 
You kinda do look like Britney Spears. 
- Oh really? - I was kidding. 
Um, anyway, this is probably my favourite. 
Hey, Jungle Lady, 
I think- 
- I think one of your bugs got out. 
What? 
This one? 
This box thing here- - It's on its side, empty. 
- Oh, my God, where did it go? 
- Is everything okay? 
No, I lost a poisonous scorpion, and I need to find it. 
Okay, kids, um, let's all tuck our pants into our socks, avoid shady, moist places, and let's make a game of looking where we step. 
- Is he okay? 
- Can we see him? 
He's in with the doctor right now. 
These things happen, right, no matter how careful you are? 
Hey, look what Grandpa gave me- - a crossbow. 
Sweetie, that does not look safe. 
Don't worry. 
He's gonna show me how to use it. 
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of. 
Come on, you ready? 
Oh, my God, you are not making comb sheaths. 
I am, and I know. 
It's really lame. Everybody hates it. 
No, it's just like, uh, Donna Rigby's party. 
Exactly, yes, and it has the beads and everything. 
Oh, amazing. 
This is awesome. 
Wow. So, Cam's a clown. 
- I got you! 
- Yeah. 
- I totally got you! 
- And there's mine. 
Do think it's weird that we both chose people 
- who are so- - 
- Uninhibited? 
I was gonna say embarrassing, but, yeah. 
Look at them, though. 
They're the life of the party. 
- You know, I got to say, for all his craziness, I love my clown. 
Me too. 
They're good for us. 
I would've totally tanked this party. 
Oh, and I would've gotten my butt kicked at a gas station. 
Sorry? 
It turns out Fizbo is a real badass. 
Aah! 
Aah! Scorpion! 
Scorpion! 
Scorpion! 
Scorpion! 
Scorpion! 
No, no. 
Too close. 
Too close. 
Too close. 
What the hell? 
Oh! Oh, crap! 
Oh, my God! 
Bianca, I'm coming. 
Who else is in there? 
Get out! 
Aaaahh! 
It turns out I'm not the sweet guy or the funny guy. 
No, manny, don't go in, por favor! 
I must! 
I'm coming! 
Manny Delgado is a man of action. 
Wait. 
My dog- - It's still in there. 
I'll be right back. 
Ow! My arm! 
Sweetie? 
Luke? 
What- - what happened, buddy? 
What happened? 
What happened, honey? Hey, hey, hey, hey, what happened? 
I slipped on these stupid beads. 
Oops. - Come on, here we go. 
How is he? 
Oh, he's gonna be fine. 
Hi, honey. 
Hey, Manny. 
How are you, kid? 
- Oh, there he is. - Uh-oh, there he is. 
Poor thing! 
Wow, everybody's here. 
Of course we are. 
How's that busted flipper? 
- Okay. - Sorry about today, buddy. 
- We'll try again next year, huh? 
- Are you kidding? 
This was the best birthday ever. 
What? 
I got a cast. 
You like the cast? 
I've always wanted one. 
After a few weeks, they start to smell. 
You are so weird. 
You know that? - Can I sign it? 
- Sure. 
Hey, me first. 
Okay. 
If you'd asked me before the party if I wanted there to be a chain reaction of disasters that led to Luke breaking his arm, 
Probably? 
Prob- - definit- 
- Definitely not, would not want that. 
But one way or another, 
Luke was the center of attention on his birthday, and the whole family was together, 
just the way it should be. 
Fizbo delivery! I brought the cake! 
I can't do this. 
Okay, I'm out. 
Cake! 
Blow- - blow the candle, Luke. 
Blow the candle. 
Bianca Douglas called me three times tonight. 
I'm not gonna lie to you. 
I'm starting to feel smothered. 
I really like my cast, but it's starting to itch. 
Good thing my mom made me this personal scratcher. 
Oh, that's good stuff. 
If another woman is messing with your man, you have to get proactive. 
I don't care how pretty she is or how many stupid reptiles she has, she tries to take what's mine, girlfriend's gonna get stung. 
Let's go, buddy. 
School time. 
Gloria, if you want to get together with the girls later, 
I could just watch the football game or something. 
- That means he wants to watch the game. 
- I'm not talking to you. 
And what are you drinking coffee for, anyway? 
It's my culture. 
I'm Colombian. 
What part of Colombia are those French toaster sticks from? 
I'm not sure about the game. 
The whole family is coming over for the barbecue. 
- It's today? 
- Sí. 
- It's the Ohio State game. 
- So, everybody can watch. 
I dislike watching the game with people who don't know the game. 
People talk. 
- You talk at my football games. 
- For one thing, it's called soccer. 
Your team's scored two goals all season. 
I'm not taking a big risk. 
- How much of this did you drink? 
- Give me a break. 
I have to climb a rope today. 
Hey, mom? 
Can I have $ 40 for lunch? $ 40? 
- I also need a book for school. 
- What book? 
I want a dress. 
Do you have any idea what a bad liar you are? 
I'd be more worried that she couldn't come up with a single book title. 
Luke, come on, we're late! 
There's a first... 
Inside out and backwards. 
At least it isn't zipped into his... 
There it is. 
There's book smart, and then there's street smart. 
Yeah, and then there's Luke. 
He's just curious, that's all. 
He's got this almost scientific mind with a thirst for knowledge. 
He's like this little Einstein. 
Some people ask" why?" 
Luke asks," why not?" 
I ask" why" a lot. 
We're at the 10... 
We're at the 5... 
We're at the 1... 
Daddy, we're scoring a touchdown! 
Please don't spike our baby. 
- Why does she look like the Hamburglar? 
- She's a referee. 
Do we even have to go to my dad's tonight? 
Are you kidding me? 
We're playing Ohio State. 
I collect antique fountain pens, I'm adept at Japanese flower arrangement... 
Ikebana. 
And I was a starting offensive lineman at the University of Illinois. 
Surprise! 
I don't like football. 
Being in a relationship is pretending to enjoy your partner's interests. 
Do you think I really loved home pickle making? 
- Yeah,' cause you did. 
- For a week, until we became the weird guys who gave everybody pickles. 
" Thank you, Marvin, for inviting us into your lovely home. 
-" Care for a sack of pickles?" 
- It was charming. 
We were picklers. 
You know what? 
Stay home with your little jagged scissors, maybe catch up on your scrapbooking. 
You loved scrapbooking! 
Did I, Mitchell? 
Did I? 
Don't do the" double question to prove a point" thing. 
I hate it. 
Do you, Mitchell? 
Do you? 
Subtitles by Tyno Kevin 
No problem. 
We'll be right down. 
Thanks. 
Hey, honey. What's up? 
The school just called. 
Luke got in a fight. 
Oh, geez. 
Is he okay? 
Yeah, he's fine, but they want us to come down there. 
- Where are you? 
- I'm showing a house. 
What house? 
I'm golfing. 
- I bet it was that Durkas kid. 
- I hate that kid. 
He probably jumped on Luke, and Luke just fought back. 
- Kid's a menace. 
- He made fun of my hair once. 
Shh, the parents are probably in there. 
I slept on it funny... Like that never happened to him. 
Come on. 
- What are you doing here? 
- These two knuckleheads were fighting. 
- What? 
! - Could have been worse. 
I was not ready to face Durkas today. 
So, what happened? 
Apparently, there was some name-calling and shoving on the playground. 
By the time a teacher separated them, Luke was sitting on Manny's chest. 
- Luke, that's not like you. 
- Wait a minute. 
You're Luke's father? 
- Grandfather. 
- So Manny's father is... 
Javier. 
Crazy guy. 
That's where he gets his fire. 
- Okay, you're... 
- He's our son. 
- And my grandson. 
- I'm his daughter. 
- So, you're... 
- His uncle. 
Stop saying that, or I'll sit on your chest again! 
Wait a second. 
Is that what this was all about? 
- He keeps calling me his nephew. 
- You are! 
Shut up! 
I'm getting the sense that you're all related... somehow. 
It's best if you work this out at home so the boys can go back to class, okay? 
But we're not happy about this, boys. 
This is not how mature young men behave. 
Here's your note for Miss Passwater. 
I wouldn't worry. 
They're good kids. 
It's just tough when one kid's a little different. 
You heard how she said that, right? 
She thought Luke was the weird one. 
Her kid gets his head stuck in the furniture, and Manny is the different one. 
Our son is not weird. 
What's weird is that her kid wears aftershave and dresses like a count. 
We should cancel with them for the barbecue. 
If we cancel, it'll just make this a bigger deal than it is. 
It'll be good for Luke and Manny to spend some time. 
- Might be good for you and Gloria, too. 
- Why? 
She's always had a problem with me. 
- I think I'm gonna find out what it is. 
- That's the worst thing you could do. 
Just sweep it under the rug. 
- I'm not a sweeper. 
- Trust me on this. 
I think you two need to talk it out. 
I don't have anything to say to her. 
She's the one with the problem, not me. 
- Whose side are you on? 
- She's my daughter. 
You're my wife. 
Let's remember what's important here... 
There's a football game on. 
I just hate it when my two girls aren't getting along. 
How exactly is she your girl? 
I got a few things for the party. 
Is Lily ready to go? 
Yeah, she's ready. 
What's wrong? 
I'm just really worried about CJ Hightower, with the bad ankle. 
I don't know how he's gonna run his corner routes. 
What did my boyfriend just say? 
Listen, I heard what you said, and I thought, yes, I should try to learn more about football. 
That is very mature of you. 
I figure if football fans can learn it, how hard can it be? 
That's very elitist of you. 
I'm taking baby steps here, all right? 
I'm actually looking forward to it. 
'Cause it's not just the game. 
It's the bands and the drama and the... the pageantry... 
- Don't forget about the team mascots. 
- They wear ascots? 
No," mascots," with an" m." 
That could have been very embarrassing. 
Am I straight? 
I am not sure what you are right now. 
How you doing? 
Hi, beautiful. 
Good to see you. 
- Let me guess. 
Game's on? 
- Just started. 
For you. 
It's nice to see you, Gloria. 
Two times today. 
She means we've seen them two times today. 
Everybody, the food's in there, the drinks are in there, I'll be in here. 
Hold on, Jay. 
I think we should address the elephant in the room. 
Bring it in. 
Come on. 
Huddle up. Football. 
Now, in light of what happened at school today, if you have any feelings you'd like to express, this is the proper forum. 
For God's sake. 
All right, both of you. 
Now, in this family, do we kick and punch each other, 
- or do we love each other? 
- Love each other. 
That's right. 
I'll be in the den. 
I brought dessert. 
Thank you. 
I make pie, too. 
You can never have too many pies, right? 
Everybody, take a deep breath. 
Let's think about getting real. 
- Phil, no. 
- Why" Phil, no"? 
- What is Phil doing? 
- I'm just gonna say it... 
There's tension between you two. 
Bam! It's out there. 
I'm gonna kill you. 
I think he's right. 
And I think we should talk about it. 
That's what I'm talkin'' bout... 
You two talking...'bout it. 
I like football. 
Haley hates it. 
Which is weird because it's all boys, and there's no reading required. 
Do you know that she spends at least 45 minutes every morning doing her hair? 
And then, sometimes, she... 
Let's go, Illini! 
Let's go, right now! 
Oh, looks like I got to watch the game with Dick Butkus. 
Dad! 
Come on, that's offensive. 
He's one of the greatest linebackers to ever play at Illinois, and one of my personal heroes. 
And his name is" Butkus"? 
Really, and we're just choosing to... 
Okay. 
All right. 
I thought you were being homophobic. 
Sorry. 
- We got all night. 
- Yes, we do. 
Are you joing us here? 
Jay, you know what? 
He's been studying up. 
I got to tell you, I am a little worried about CJ Hightower, with the bad ankle. 
I'm wondering how he's gonna run his corner routes. 
- Hightower's out. 
- What? 
- Who is gonna run the corner routes? 
- I'll tell you who won't be. 
Billings. 
That's low. 
He's in jail. 
Yeah, I dunno. 
Double tight end. 
It's gonna be a quarterback roll-out... 
- They're gonna run it. 
- He's got the slot, and the end zone! 
- Touchdown! 
- Lucky call! 
- They should have considered blitzing. 
- Blitzing wouldn't have helped them. 
- Get out of here. 
- Oh, gosh. 
Blitzing. 
So, my interest in football ended as suddenly and dramatically as the climax of" West Side Story." 
I'm a musical-theater fan. 
Surprise! 
Okay, the truth? 
I sometimes feel like you don't like me. 
Powerful, powerful stuff. 
- Claire, tell us how it makes you feel. 
- Right now, I'm feeling a lot of anger. 
Don't tell me, tell her. 
- Gloria, I'm really angry at Phil. 
- Let's respect the process. 
Gloria, I don't know why you think I don't like you. 
Well, sometimes when you see me, you make that face. 
- What face? 
- Like this. 
- I do not make a face like that. 
- That is so Claire. 
See? 
She does that with everyone. 
- It's just her face. 
- No, it's not just the face. 
From the beginning, I feel like Manny and I are not welcome in this family. 
That is so crazy! 
No, it's not so crazy. 
It's how I feel. 
I am sorry if you feel that way. 
I really am. 
Because from the moment I met you, 
I have tried to make you feel comfortable with us. 
You think it's all in my head? 
Kind... 
I don't know. 
I mean... 
We really love having you and Manny in our family. 
- Really? 
- Really. 
So... you don't have to be so defensive. 
I do that, don't I? 
A little. 
A little bit. 
I'm feeling a hug. 
I was thinking group hug, but this is nice. 
I'd be there if I could... 
Oh, my God, there's hugging. 
Get off the phone already. 
- Where did you go? 
- You heard him. 
- He said," get out of here." 
- You're such a girl. 
Dad, loo... 
I was coming to get a beer, anyways. 
- Nice apology. 
- Nice beer. 
There's our little roustabouts! 
You look like you patched things up pretty good, huh? 
We can learn so much from the children. 
I bet it seems kind of silly now what you were fighting about. 
- I made fun of his accent. 
- What accent? 
I made fun of him for having the same thing for lunch every day. 
I made fun of him because his mom used to dig coal. 
What? 
- He said you were a coal digger. 
- Okay, I think we can move on! 
- Who said I was a coal digger? 
- That's what my mom told me. 
- What's a coal digger? 
- He heard it wrong. 
It's" gold digger." 
I'm gonna have to call you back. 
I really do not think that I remember ever saying that. 
Well, you said it in the car, you said it at Christmas, you said it in the Mexican restaurant... 
Okay, Mr." Leaves his sweatshirts at school every day" 
suddenly remembers everything. 
Thank you. 
And it was all in my head, huh? 
Listen, Gloria, it was like a year ago before... 
- I knew you... 
- Nice going. 
Now my mom and my sister are fighting. 
If I say something everybody's thinking, does that make me a mean person? 
Or... does it make me a brave person? 
One who is courageous enough to stand up and say something... 
Behind someone's back to... a 10-year old? 
Well, she's pissed. 
She wouldn't even come out of her room. 
Did you really have to call her that? 
A gold digger. 
You know what, dad? 
It was a year ago. 
And it was a natural question to ask. 
She's a beautiful, hot woman, and you're not exactly... 
Not exactly what? 
- Mitchell, a little help? 
- No, you are doing great. 
See, this is exactly why we sweep things under the rug. 
So people don't get hurt. 
Until you sweep too much under the rug. Then you got a lumpy rug. 
It creates a tripping hazard. 
You open yourself up to lawsuits. 
Boy, you can go a really long time without blinking. 
It's Phil. 
Can I talk to you for a second? 
Claire likes to say, you can be part of the problem or part of the solution. 
Well, I happen to believe that you can be both. 
Listen, Claire feels terrible. 
Why don't you talk to her? 
Why? 
I know what she thinks... 
- A coal digger. 
- She's saying" gold digger." 
I know she said that, but that was a long time ago, 
- before... she knew you. 
- Does Jay buy me nice things? 
Yes, of course! 
All beautiful things! 
Look at this. 
Yellow, red, blue... 
All the colors. 
Do you think I can't live without these? 
Take them away, Phil. 
We all know you'd be fine without underwear. 
I mean, we know it's not about that. 
It's about me not being accepted by my new family. 
That is not true. 
Gloria, look, you're a beautiful woman. 
In fact, you're probably one of those beautiful women who doesn't know it. 
I know it. 
So it's natural for Claire to wonder about you and her dad. 
This family is very protective of each other. 
I remember the first time Claire brought me home. 
Do you think Jay thought I was good enough for his little girl? 
No way. 
But, over time, he realized that I loved Claire as much as he did. 
And by then, Mitch had brought Cam home, so I was golden. 
Claire just needs a little time. 
And then, trust me, she'll be the most loyal friend you've ever had. 
- You're not leaving, are you? 
- There's kind of a lot of drama. 
- So we're torn. 
- Let me ask you something. 
Your sister said that Gloria would never go for anybody who looked like me. 
Now, you guys basically... are like women. 
You look at guys. 
So what do you think? 
You're seriously asking us if you're attractive? 
I know I'm no Erik Estrada or anything. 
I'm just curious is all. 
So, if I was in one of your bars and... 
Righteous Brothers were on, would you... 
I don't know... 
Check me out? 
Dad, you're really close to ruining gay for me. 
- All right, fine, whatever... 
- Now, listen, I think it's... 
I just think it's a little weird for a son to say this to his father, but, for the record... 
- You're smoking hot. 
- Really? 
100 %. 
You're totally my type, dangerous, gettable. 
You have a little cashola in your pocket. 
- Face, body, the whole... 
- The whole kit and caboodle, 
I think, really. 
- What, about a 7? 
- 9. For sure 9. 
But you knew that. 
I might have lowballed a bit. 
Isn't there a game on? 
- Touchy. 
- I know. 
Gloria? 
Come on, let's talk about this. 
I've seen her kick in a door before. 
I don't know what my husband is saying to you, or why he's covered in your underwear... 
Obviously, I'm trying to seduce him for his money. 
That's what I do, right? 
What do I have to give back so that everyone trusts me? 
These earrings? 
What? 
This bracelet? 
My new dress? 
I didn't respond because... this shouldn't be... about me. 
It should be about you talking to you... about it. 
Honey... 
You're welcome. 
I don't know what to say except for that I am really, really sorry. 
Just tell me one thing. 
How do you really feel that I'm with your father? 
Honestly, at first, it was hard. 
You don't expect to wake up one morning with a new mom who looks like she fell off a mud flap. 
But... 
I'm getting used to it. 
The important thing is you make him happy, which you do, in so many ways. 
So many colors. 
Are we okay? 
You embarrassed me in front of everyone downstairs. 
What, I'm supposed just to forget about it? 
What do you want me to do? 
Just embarrass myself so we're even? 
- Go jump in the pool. 
- You mean" go jump in a lake," right? 
Go jump in the pool with your clothes. 
Then I know you're sorry. 
I'm not gonna do that, Gloria. 
Then I won't forgive you. 
Now a field goal beats us! 
You guys work that out? 
Almost. 
Gloria wants me to jump in the pool. 
- Okay, then. 
- What? 
If they kick... get a pass rush on them, something, a break. 
- This is so awesome. 
- I know. Mom does not look good wet. 
Gloria, is this really necessary? 
Dad, it's fine. 
If I need to jump in this water to prove to Gloria how sorry I am, I will do it. 
It's fine. 
- You're seriously not gonna stop me? 
- Why would I do that? 
Because I am standing here. 
I'm showing you my willingness to... 
Are you happy? 
I forgive you! 
- Then give me your hand. 
- That's the oldest trick in the book. 
She's gonna pull you in there. 
And that's my job. 
This is funny, but this is also a teaching moment. 
Think of all... 
What? 
Cannonball! 
- Come on. 
How could he fumble that? 
- Center blew the snap. 
I hate that. 
I played center, and I always got blamed for a quarterback's clumsy hands. 
Well, I was a quarterback, and it was probably your fault. 
It's impossible to fumble the ball when the QB has the proper hand placement. 
It's weird to think of a woman being sexually attracted to dad. 
You want to hear weird? 
Cam said he'd pick up dad at a gay bar. 
- How did that come up? 
- I'm really trying to block it out. 
As far as I'm concerned, mum and dad had sex two times. 
- Agreed. 
- Now get your hands up there, and... 
Like you're lifting me off the ground. 
Be one with me, Jay. 
There you go. 
- Do you want to get something to eat? 
- I am never eating again. 
Just snap the damn thing. 
Perfect. That one kind hurt. 
- Bravo! Bravo! 
Bravo, Manny! Bravo! 
Well, when I heard Manny wanted to fence, I was, like, " Sure. 
Uncoordinated kid, lethal weapon. 
[ Whistle Blows ] [ Buzzer Sounds ] 
[ Gloria ] What do you think now? 
I'm proud of our little Zorro. 
I worked with him a little, but the kid's got skills. 
It's in his blood. 
His father was a master swordsman. 
He was an artist with his sword. 
I mean, the way he throws the sword. 
I mean, he was legendary. 
You know this nice moment I'm having with your son? 
You're kind of wrecking it. 
Sorry. - [ Whistle Blows ] - [ Buzzer Sounds ] 
Did you know that fencing goes back to the 12th century? 
You know what's even nerdier than fencing? 
Knowing when it began. I don't think you're a nerd, Alex. 
Shut up, dork. 
All right. 
Would this be easier... if we suspended you from a crane? 
[ Cameron ] Αny monkey can shoot a home movie. 
I pride myself on shooting home films. 
But, Cameron, you always just take things a little too far. 
Okay, your nephew's first birthday. 
That's not fair. 
You brought a wind machine. 
To be fair, my vision was - 
Cameron, you brought a wind machine. 
[ Shouting In Spanish ] ¡ Ay! 
Sorry. Sorry. 
[ Laughs ] 
That's okay. No. 
No, no, no, no! 
My phone died. No biggie. 
Your battery probably just statically defracticated. 
What? 
It means you can recharge it with static electricity. Just rub it on your hair. 
[ Buzzer Sounds ] [ Jay ] Yes! 
You know, I used to go to the houses of my friends, I'd see their kids' trophies, and it used to bug me, you know, because there was never a trophy in my house. 
[ Laughs ] [ Phil ] Oh, that's a good grip. 
[ Chuckles ] Can we switch seats? 
Cam, people are staring. 
[ Whistle Blows ] 
I know you're not supposed to care, but it's kind of cool to have a kid in your house who's the best at something. 
[ Applause ] 
Yeah, our kids are great. 
They're the greatest. 
Gosh, we're blessed. 
We are. 
But, um, are they the best at something? 
I'd have to think about that. 
Well, Alex is great at every single thing she tries, so, you know, she'll find her specialty. 
She will. And Haley is - 
Haley is so pretty. 
Gorgeous, gorgeous girl. 
Oh, gosh. 
So she can meet someone who's the best at something. 
That's right. And then, uh, I guess that leaves Luke. 
We dropped the ball a little bit on that one. 
♪ Hey, hey Hey, hey ♪ ♪ Hey, hey Hey ♪ ♪ 
[ Whistle Blows ] [ Buzzer Sounds ] 
Bravo! How about a nice round of applause for our winner, Manny Delgado. 
Manny now moves on to the championship, where he'll be competing against Caroline Markum. 
We'll see you all back here at 4 : 30. 
- All right. - [ Gloria ] Bravo. 
What she said. 
[ Laughs ] Wow. This means more to Dad than it does to Manny. 
Yeah, it's his chance to be father of a champion. 
Well, second chance. 
We all know how the first time went. Did I say something wrong? 
No, no. 
I'm - I'm very happy for Manny. 
Everything's always about Claire. 
Geez. I wanna thank you guys for coming by and supporting the kid. 
You guys are the best! 
[ Chuckles ] Why, Claire? 
[ Mitchell ] Really? 
That took a while. 
She's been asleep for 20 minutes. 
It just took me some time to sneak out without waking her up. 
Kind of like the first time you slept over here. 
I had a meeting. 
All right. Let's talk about why you got your panties in a bunch. 
What's up with you and your sister? 
Nothing is up. 
Mm-hmm. Or could this have something to do with... ice skating? 
- When Mitchell and Claire were kids - 
- This is interesting to no one. 
Excuse, please. 
Let me finish. 
Thank you. When Mitchell was 10 - Eleven. 
And Claire was 13, they were competitive ice dancers - Figure skaters! 
Oh, for God's sakes, I'll tell the story. 
Yes, my sister and I were actually a very good team. 
We were called" Fire and Nice." 
I was Fire, because of the red hair, and Claire was Nice, because it was ironic and she wasn't. 
And Mitchell is still upset because Claire quit the team right before some meet. 
" Some meet." The 13-and-under regional championships. 
Just the Emerald City at the end of my yellow brick road. 
Wow. You did it. 
What? 
You made figure skating sound even gayer. 
So, seeing your dad so proud of Manny... didn't stir up any resentment? 
Mm-mmm. Oh. 
Instead of letting your feelings out, you bury them, and then they bubble up later in hurtful ways. 
Okay, you know what? 
I might still be holding a little resentment, but that's... embarrassing and petty and it's not a good color on me. Yes. 
All right, listen. 
It's kind of like you and yellow. 
You love me in my yellow shirt. 
It makes you look like the sun. 
Bubbling. 
Hurtful bubbling. - Now you know why I left early that morning. 
- Ha! I knew you didn't have a meeting, Cam. 
I knew it. 
There must be something wrong with this phone. 
I've rubbed it on my head for, like, an hour. 
What? 
Alex. - [ Chuckles ] 
- Oh, you're such a geek. 
At least I didn't give myself a bald spot. 
Oh, my God! 
Mom! Alex, don't be mean. 
Haley, stop making yourself such an easy target. 
This feels right, buddy. I'm telling you, this feels right. 
What are you guys doing? 
Pursuing excellence. 
We make a list of areas the boy might excel at and... baseball. 
Love it. 
Yeah. 
I read it only takes 10,000 hours to achieve excellence. 
You've already got, what, how many hours playing ball? 
Well, I played, like, one season, so, like, 6,000 hours? 
I can see why you ruled out math. 
[ Claire ] Yeah, of course I want Luke to be successful. 
But I don't think that a parent can just force that. 
I think you just have to have faith that the kid's gonna find his own way. 
Besides, Luke already is the best at something - being my son. 
[ Chuckles ] 
It sounded a lot less lame in my head. 
I have got a good feeling about this. 
This is gonna be your sport. 
Last year, you said basketball was my sport. 
Look, I've said a lot of things I wish I could take back but I can't. 
What I can do... is be the dad you need me to be to help you become masterful. 
You wanna be masterful? I guess. 
There's my killer! 
Okay. 
Our journey of 10,000 hours... begins with a single pitch. 
I believe in my boy. 
I ain't gonna quit you. Let's burn one in here. 
That's good. 
That's a good start. 
Okay, you rest that cannon while I run this down, okay? 
Okay, let's keep all the batters right here. 
Oh, should've - should've worn my cup. Should've worn my cup. 
Home run! 
This one's really in here, buddy. 
Very, very, very, very good first hour. 
Toss me your glove. I'll put some oil on it. Yeah. 
¡ Ay, abuela, es que lo que yo te diga es poco! 
Yes. 
I was telling my grandmother how great was Manny today. 
So that wasn't angry talk? 
No, silly. 
That was happy talk. 
I'm beginning to understand why there's so much conflict on your continent. 
Here. Check this out. 
Ah, Jay. 
[ Chuckles ] 
Jay loves to make T-shirts for special occasions. Come on, baby. Show them. 
A few years back, my granddaughter Haley ran a 5K, so I had a few of these made up. 
It's just fun. 
[ Chuckles ] 
I love it when you're so proud of Manny. You know, I'm not gonna lie. 
Seeing him out there slicing those kids to pieces, you know, it gets to ya. 
- Gracias, mi amor. 
- I'm sorry to interrupt. It's okay, papi. 
Hey, champ! I got a little something for you. 
And I have something for you. 
Here. 
I will not be needing it anymore. 
- But the finals? 
- I am retired. 
[ Birds Chirping ] [ Jay ] Wait, wait, wait. 
You can't retire. 
- It's just not fun anymore. 
- Well, that's probably just butterflies. Come on. 
You're gonna be fine. 
Look, if he doesn't want to, it's his decision. 
Ah, the hell it is. 
He shouldn't be doing anything that makes him nervous. 
Papi, I support you. I'm not nervous. 
I just don't want to fight a girl. 
What? 
Defeating a woman will be a mark on my honor. [ Gloria ] Why? 
Because men are always so superior to woman? 
So superior that you cannot even finish your sentence? 
Dude. 
Manny, you always call yourself the lover of women, but if you don't compete with this girl, you're showing me and all the woman that you don't respect us. 
I'm sorry. 
Okay, so, take back your sword... 
- and go fight this girl like a bull. - Okay. 
Can't hear you! 
Okay! 
- I can't hear you! 
- That's really as loud as I can go. 
What does it take to make a great salesman? 
It's no big secret. 
You just follow the ABC's of salesmanship - Always Be Closing. 
Don't Ever Forget Great Home Ideas Just Keep Lurking, Mostly Nearby. 
Often People Question Realtors' Sincerity. Take Umbrage. 
Violators Will - Oh, shoot. X 
- X - 
And this is the great room, although" great" hardly seems to do a room like this justice. 
Weird, squiggly painting not included. I actually love it. 
I do too. 
It's really beautiful. 
Um, all custom built-ins, and you will notice just - just tons of natural light, so that's great. 
Did I need the sale? Yes. Was I worried? 
No. Why? Because. 
Because why? 
Because I won't sell anything I don't believe in. 
And when I believe, you believe. 
I could sell a fur coat to an Eskimo. Yeah, Phil, I'm sorry. 
It's a beautiful house. 
But I'm just not sure how kid-friendly it is, and we have two small children. 
I mean, these stairs alone - Dad, this place is awesome. 
Not now, Luke. 
Did you see the backyard? 
It's got room for 10 tree houses. 
And the bedroom's got a window on the ceiling. 
I wish we could live here. - I wish you'd go back out to the patio where - 
- Do you really? 
Oh, yeah. 
Our house sucks compared to this one. 
- Hmm. 
- It really does. 
[ Phil Chuckles ] There you are. I'm gonna get changed and then we'll go back to Manny's match, okay? 
Dad doesn't want me to go. 
What? Why? 
Remember when you were all worried that our son's a dud? 
That's not exactly the way I remember it. Turns out he's a natural. 
At what? 
At selling. 
Hey, titans of residential real estate. 
That's right, I'm talking to you, Sandy Brewster, Skip Woosnum, J.J. McCubbin. 
Hear those footsteps? 
That's Luke Dunphy, and he's gonna drink your milk shake. 
That's amazing. 
Right? Incredible. 
So, the buyer's coming back in an hour with her husband, and I need him. 
I am telling you, that kid is a genius. 
There's the rainmaker. 
- Why is your iPod in your mouth? 
- I'm charging it. 
Alex. 
Alex! 
So, there's no part of you that wants to clear the air with your sister? Nope. Okay, fine. 
I'll respect that. 
But you should know, it's hard on the people who love you. 
Cam - We feel the tension. 
We hear the words that cut like knives. 
Hey, guys! I brought orange slices. 
Okay, you know what? I can't bear this. 
Claire, Mitchell still resents you for quitting the figure skating team when you were kids. 
Ladies, come inside with me, please. 
Work it out. Come on. 
Thanks, Cam. 
Is he serious? 
Is that what your little jab was about this morning? 
Okay. No. Yes. 
Okay, yes. Yes. 
I guess I'm still a little angry. 
But, you know, you stole my moment, Claire. 
Okay, but it doesn't matter to you... because you had your own moments. 
You had cheerleading and high school plays and making out with the quarterback. 
You made out with him too. 
Yeah, but we had to keep it a secret. 
You shouldn't have quit. 
You wanna know why I quit? 
I quit to protect you. 
From what? Glory? Fame? 
Press conferences? What? 
Come on. 
I was bigger than you. 
I was bigger than you, and I was afraid you wouldn't be able to lift me. 
You were dropping me in practice - I dropped you twice. 
And I didn't want you to humiliate yourself in front of all those people. 
Three times. 
You dropped me all the time. 
[ Sighs ] Come on. 
Could you just forgive me and move on? 
[ Exhales ] Of course. Yes, yes. 
Yes, of - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
Oh. 
This must seem so petty, huh? 
Well, it's a little silly, but we all have our thing, don't we? 
I'm just glad you're getting it out of you. 
Are you trying to lift me? 
You are. You're trying to lift me. 
Oh! 
Stay focused, stay loose and stay angry. 
Who's the toughest? 
I am. 
Who's the bravest? 
I am. 
Who's the baddest? 
Can you guys ask all the questions now so I don't have to keep lifting this? 
Go. 
Go get' em! 
There we go. 
You all set? 
Yeah. 
Okay, go get' em. 
Good luck. Excuse me. 
Is this seat taken? No. 
Sit. 
Oh, thank you. 
Oh, is Manny yours? 
Yes. Oh, he's quite good. 
I saw him earlier. 
Thank you. 
Yeah. 
Is she your little girl? 
Oh, Caroline? No. No. 
Sadly, her parents passed away. I'm her nurse down at the children's hospital. 
But all of my patients are like family to me. 
[ Laughing ] [ Man ] Well, our boys are enjoying themselves. 
Yeah. 
I can talk about crown moldings and recessed lighting until the cows come home, but nothing compares with that sound right there. 
[ Thud ] Ow! Ow! Oh. 
Hey, buddy. 
Oh, he's fine. 
Ow. My foot. 
I think it's backwards. 
It's not backwards. 
[ Man ] Wh-What happened? 
[ Luke ] It's the stupid floors! 
They're too slippery. Oak. 
Also known as nature's pillow. 
It's like ice. 
Now, let's not start blaming the floors. 
You shouldn't have been running. 
I saw a ghost. Ghosts. 
Hey, Phil Dunphy. 
Okay, that's me. 
That's acting like a natural shoehorn. Okay. Probably better all take our shoes off for this part of the tour. 
Follow me. 
She's our little miracle. Oh. 
I only wish her father had made it back from Afghanistan to see this. 
[ Clattering ] Oh, there's our cheering section. 
Over here, you guys. 
Oh, my God. We have to stop him. 
Maybe I can pull the fire alarm. 
[ Whistle Blows ] Expect no mercy. 
Bring it on, big boy. 
- [ Whistle Blows ] 
- I'm-I'm glad Dad's proud of Manny. 
I am. 
I just - It would have been nice to see him that proud of us. 
By us, I mean me. 
[ Scoffs ] 
And you sincerely thought that the path to Dad's approval... was going to be through figure skating? 
Mitchell, I am fairly confident that Dad's proudest moment... was when you finally took off the flame-red unitard. 
I am not claiming that any of this is rational. 
I'm-I'm sorry. 
I'm sorry for being such a pill, okay? 
Um, actually, I always felt very guilty for quitting. 
I know how much you loved figure skating. 
I never really loved skating. 
Uh, what? 
Um, all right, this is gonna sound a little gay. 
But, um, when-when you and I skated together, you weren't the mean older sister and I wasn't the clingy little brother. 
We were - We were a team, and - 
Well, let's face it, we've kind of grown apart in the past few years. 
And with Mom and Dad's divorce, we were on opposing sides. 
- I just - I miss being on your team. 
That's... a little gay. 
Claire, where are you going? 
Claire? 
No way. 
Get up. 
Really? Mm-hmm. 
Don't drop me. 
[ Buzzer Sounds ] Put it away or lose it. 
[ Buzzer Sounds ] [ Spectators Groan ] Somebody's got to put a stop to this. 
That's it, Mitchell. 
So, can we take you and Caroline out for ice cream? 
We can't. 
She's diabetic. 
Of course she is. [ Man ] A round of applause for our winner, Manny Delgado. 
Let's get out of here. 
Get this thing in the trunk. 
I can't decide if I'm feeling more proud or mortified. 
How about now? 
[ Jay ] We tell our kids it doesn't matter if you win or lose, but let's be honest. 
Winning feels pretty great. 
There's nothing like that golden moment in the sun. 
I think every parent probably wants that for their child. [ Laughs ] 
And maybe a little bit for ourselves too. 
[ Laughing ] Sometimes we push too hard. 
And that leads to a lot of resentment and guilt. 
So, how much is too much? 
Here's where I come out. 
Guilt fades. 
Hardware is forever. 
You're mad, aren't you? 
I'm not mad. 
Yes, you are. 
No, I'm not. 
You're a little jealous. I'm happy for the two of you. 
All right, come on. 
We'll do one. 
Stay there. 
For real? 
Feel better? 
Yeah. 
Oh, do me now. 
Come on. 
What are you talking about? 
Are you serious? 
- Cam, no. 
Fix that step. 
Morning. 
I'm still sleeping. 
Happy anniversary. 
And they said we wouldn't last. 
Who said that? 
- Oh, look at you. 
You're cute. 
- Go ahead. 
Open it. 
- What have you done? 
- Nothing. 
Something, nothing. 
- It's a View-Master. 
- Look inside. 
Oh, it's us. 
Look at how young we are. 
Oh, God, that perm. Yeah, it really framed my face. 
Why is there a picture of a bracelet? 
Must be some kind of a mistake. 
What the heck is that? 
- Oh, Phil, you didn't. - What? 
Did he? 
Did he? 
It's beautiful. 
Oh, sweetie, I love it. 
Okay, your turn. 
- My turn? 
Where is it? 
- It's on the bureau. 
I'm surprised I didn't see it. 
Where? 
There, the red envelope. 
- It's a... card. 
- That's where you're wrong. 
I am so excited. 
Coupons for... 
Five... free... hugs. 
- You don't like it? 
- Are you kidding me? 
I love it. 
It's so creative. 
Coupons for hugs, which are usually free, but this makes it official, which is so great. 
I was so proud of myself when I thought of it because you're impossible to buy for. 
You never want anything. 
Things I want... 
Robot dog, night-vision goggles, bug vacuum, GPS watch, speakers that look like rocks. 
I love my wife, but she sucks at giving gifts. 
I'm sorry for the pay-channel language, but... 
Yogurt maker. 
I can't not think of things I want. 
- Can't tell if she needs a new diaper. 
- I think we'd be able to tell. 
With these diapers, it's hard to tell. 
Triple leakage protection. 
Leaklock... contours to protect her little body. 
No gapping or chapping. 
Do you think that maybe we need a... 
Night out? 
Yes. 
Just a few hours with a couple of adults, a few drinks, no baby talk. 
- It'll make us better parents. - Stop drilling. 
You've struck oil. 
We'll get Gloria to babysit. 
We're going out. 
- You got some spittle. 
- Do I? 
You know who'd be fun to call? Sal. 
Raise the roof, Lily. 
We're calling Sal. 
Sal is our very best friend in the whole wide world. 
The reason we love her so much is she has absolutely no inhibitions. 
And that's before she starts drinking. 
Hanging out with her is like an Amsterdam Saturday night every day of the week. 
And, ironically, 
Sal's not allowed back into Amsterdam. 
Anyday of the week. 
Of course we would love to have the baby. 
All the other cousins are sleeping over tonight. 
The more, the merrier. 
See you tonight. Bye-bye. 
Is Haley still coming? 
You're related. 
I will spray you with the hose. 
All the grandkids are coming over for" Jay's night." Family tradition. 
Everybody wears PJ's, which they love. 
I make my famous Sloppy Jays, which are really Sloppy Joes, but made by Jay, which they love. 
And then we watch a western together, which they don't care for, but, hey, it's" Jay's night." 
So, Mom, there's a party tonight at Andrew Adler's, and everybody's gonna be there. 
That sounds like so much fun, but I have other plans. 
That's high-larious, but I'm talking about me. 
That's unusual. 
You said you'd go to your grandfather's. 
That's what's so perfect about this. 
Andrew lives a couple blocks away from Grandpa, so I figured... 
Sweetie, you made a commitment. 
But I really want to go. 
And plus, every time I go over to Grandpa's, 
Manny just stares at me the whole time. 
Maybe if you wore a bra. 
What? 
I can't wait to go to Grandpa's. 
Family means everything to me. 
Because you have no friends. 
Because I love Grandpa, and he's getting older. 
Who knows how many years he has left? 
- Is Grandpa dying? 
- Didn't they tell you? 
Stop torturing your brother. 
No, your grandfather is fine. 
For now. 
Who could that be? 
You expecting someone special? 
Thank you. 
Flowers, too? 
- I'm sorry. 
- What are you apologizing for? 
- They're gorgeous. 
- It's too much, you know. 
With the View-Master and the bracelet and the flowers and the balloons. 
- Balloons? 
- They're attached to your car. 
I just don't want you to feel bad about your little... coupons. 
Wait. You thought the coupons were your only present? 
- Are you kidding me? 
- They aren't? 
Phil, come on. 
It's our anniversary. 
Those coupons were just like a fun, little way to kick off the day. 
Your real present is coming tonight, and you're gonna love it. 
Love it! 
Cool! 
I got nothing. 
I'm so screwed. 
This place brings back so many memories. 
Get in here! 
Big bear! 
And my baby cub! 
- Oh, my God! 
You guys! 
- Look at you! 
You notice anything different? 
- Your hair's longer, right? 
- Did you get your teeth bleached? 
Let me give you a little hint. 
Ba-boobs! 
- Oh, my God! 
- Those are sensational! 
I know. 
Right? 
- You want to touch' em? 
- I'm gay, not dead. 
Are you okay with this? 
Yeah, you're drinking a passion-fruit daiquiri. 
- Get in there good. 
- I'm coming in! 
So, Lily likes that... singing? 
Yes. 
It relaxes her. 
So Lily's deaf. 
There are my little stinkers! 
- Hi, grandpa. 
- Come on in. 
- Well, hello, there, Haley. 
- Take it down a notch, Jethro. 
So, you guys ready for some fun? 
What? 
I love you, Grandpa, and I'm never gonna forget you. 
Back at you, champ. 
This is a pajama party. 
Where's your PJ's? 
They're in my bag. 
I need to talk to you about something. 
She wants to go to a party with Dylan, Grandpa. 
Shut up, Alex! 
It's at my friend Andrew Adler's. 
He lives three blocks from here. 
Oh, walking distance. 
Right. 
So I wouldn't ask you this, because I love coming to your house, but it's kind of an important party... 
If somebody invites you over, the last thing you want to do is insult them. 
- Exactly! 
- I'm glad we agree. 
Oh, my God, that was so easy. 
This is awesome. 
You really don't understand what just happened there, do you? 
PJ's on, Haley! 
What? 
I would be happy to let her change in my room. 
Who could that be? 
Are you expecting someone special? 
What did you do? 
Nothing. 
I just know that there's someone at the door. 
Rock on, Phil Dunphy. 
Read it and weep, Phil! 
It's the Iz! 
Who? 
Izzy Lafontaine from Spandau Ballet. 
Izzy Fontaine from Pa... 
He's got it now. 
He's got it. 
He's just seriously freaking out. 
Phil loves Spandau Ballet. 
That song" True" was playing in the car the first time we kissed. 
It's our song. 
So I did some research, found out that the lead guitarist lives like 40 miles from here. 
He was in the phone book. 
How' 80s is that? 
I never liked Spandau Ballet. 
Our entire marriage, I never once mentioned Spandau Ballet. 
Am I even pronouncing that right? 
Here to play a private concert for us 
- is the guitarist... 
- Bass player, actually. 
-... and lead singer... 
- Backup. 
Backup. ... of Spandau Ballet. 
Between Richard Miller and Martin Kemp. 
Oh, those guys. 
I miss you two guys so much. 
So, so much. 
- To us! 
- Yeah, to us! 
To us, the three musketeers! 
- Cabo! 
- What? 
Seriously, you bastards, we've been talking about it forever. 
We're doing it! 
We're going to Cabo! 
Let's do it! Let's do it! 
- All right, let's go! 
- Yes. That will be fun. 
" Fun"? 
Are you joking? 
Margaritas, you guys, these guys. 
- It's gonna be epic! 
- We need to find someone for Lily. 
How much are you gonna pay me to go make out with the waitress? 
Wait. 
Which one? 
The old one or the young one? 
$ 10 for the young one, $ 20 for the old. 
I am about to make 30 bucks. 
- I'm just gonna go check on Lily. 
- Right now? 
- It'll just take a second. 
- Well, I'm just... 
You're gonna miss me sluttin' it up with Driving Miss Daisy. 
- It'll just take a second. 
- Real fast. You should kill that baby. 
What? 
You should call the baby. 
I love you guys so much! 
- Did she just... 
- I'm scared. 
- I got nothing. 
- I think I have a very good pair. 
- You sure do. 
- And I got squat. 
I don't think I have anything, either. 
Are you kidding me? 
That's a straight. 
- Really? 
- She wins. 
- You won! 
- I win. 
You know what? 
I think I deserve a soda. 
- Good job, Haley. 
- I don't know how to play. 
Hi, honey. 
- Gee, you scared me. 
- How did you... 
Light bulb went out. 
You don't change right away, you never get around to it. 
There. 
Now I can see everything that goes on around here. 
I've had a little practice at this. 
Haley wasn't throwing anything at me I hadn't seen before from her mother and then some. 
But nobody gets off the rock. 
Right, here's a track. 
Wasn't so popular in America. 
Got to number six on the Netherlands' charts, though. 
That whole summer, I couldn't walk to the corner in Amsterdam without mobs of birds coming up and asking me for the double bubble. 
Okay, just play it, I think. 
Yeah. 
He's awesome, honey. 
- You're welcome. 
- Tonight 
So right 
So right 
Lover 
Hey, Phil, I think your lover wants a kiss from you. 
Come on, man. 
She's not your sister. 
Give her a proper snog. 
That's a bad joke. 
Not funny. 
My sister lost her feet to complications from diabetes. 
Can I get you some water, there, guy, or... 
You got tea? 
- Yes, of course. 
I'll get that. 
- Yeah, chamomile. 
You don't miss a minute. 
Oh, God. 
Why did... 
Look at what I'm doing. 
I'm making it all about me. 
What a downer. 
It's your evening. Let's make it great. 
Name your playlist. 
I'll do it all. 
Just the classics. 
Let's play the hits. 
We'll get to the hits, obviously. 
Go to the back catalog. Favorite B-side. 
That's fun! 
Yeah, that's fun. 
- Just... 
I'm so bad with titles. - Hum it. 
Just did that one, didn't I? 
That's right. It's in the noodle. 
So, I guess... 
What album is that on? 
- Second. 
I want to say second. 
- What's on the cover? 
There's a warlock, I think. 
Or a seascape. 
- Oh," Millennium Sunrise"? 
-" Millennium Sunrise." 
There is no" Millennium Sunrise" record. 
What? 
What? 
You're not a fan-dau. You didn't even know who I was at the door. 
I saw it in your eyes. 
Am I being Punk'd? 
This means so much to Claire. 
I don't want to hurt her feelings. 
Her feelings? 
Well, what about my feelings? 
This is my career, man. 
My music was the soundtrack to people's lives. 
Now I'm nothing. 
How do you think that feels? 
This is really humiliating. 
Don't go. 
Don't go! 
What are you guys doing? 
He let me touch it. 
I think she said" kill," Cam. 
I do. Maybe it was just a joke. 
She's always had a dark sense of humor. 
That's true. Remember her Halloween costume? 
When she came as Siegfried and part of Roy? 
It was too soon. 
This was just a joke. 
Here she comes. 
I'm gonna bring up Lily. We'll see what she says. 
- Show her some pictures. 
- Pay up, bitches! 
- More drinks. 
- Free drinks! 
- You've got to look at these pictures. 
- What are they of? 
- It's Lily at the zoo. 
- Oh, cute. 
- Look at that one. 
- Cute, cutie cute, cute, et cetera. 
So, you guys are gonna have to bring Lily to Cabo, now that you're the guys that always bring Lily. 
- Well, you know... probably. 
- Yeah, probably. 
I will throw her in the ocean. 
- What? - I said I got to go pee. 
- Okay, that wasn't even close. - Nope. 
I mean, what do we do? 
Do we say something? 
How do we even bring it up? 
She threatened our child, and that's your concern, a segue? 
- You know what this is? 
- What? 
This is first-child syndrome. 
It's where the first child is happy, and then the second child comes along, and the first child gets jealous of the second child and starts acting out. 
Yes, that's brilliant, except Sal's not our child. 
Well, think about it. 
We've practically done everything for her. 
We've held her when she's cried. 
We've carried her when she couldn't walk. 
We've done everything but potty-train her. 
I was thinking... 
- Oh, sorry. 
-... that when we go to Cabo, we have find a hotel with a swim-up bar'cause this going back and forth to the bathroom is a fool's game. 
- Okay, let's get more drinks. 
- Sal, Sal, we got to talk. 
- It's about Lily. 
- Oh, shocker. 
Do you think it's at all possible that maybe you're jealous of her? 
What? ! 
- It's just... 
I don't know. 
- What? ! 
Why would you say that? 
You won't look at any pictures of her, and you talked about killing her and throwing her in the ocean. 
That was a joke. 
You guys, come on! 
We're fine. 
Show me the pictures of Yoko. 
- See? 
- Okay, it's a joke. 
You guys, come on! 
Because she's Asian and she broke up our group. 
I just... 
Let's at least acknowledge that things have changed between us. 
And you know what? 
Because Lily's here doesn't mean we love you any less. 
No, absolutely not. 
We used to be really close, and you used to call me a lot. 
- And now you never call me. 
- Well, but we... 
And last week, I had a really bad dream, and I was thinking," Okay, I'm gonna call them," 
and then I thought," Oh, no! 
You can't call them because 
" you might wake up their baby!" 
- You can always call. 
- Oh, honey, always call us. 
I'm sorry we haven't been there. 
We're here now, okay? 
- Feel better? 
- I think you just put a little spittle. 
- Did she just fall asleep? 
- I wish Lily would do the same. 
Give her eight shots of tequila. 
I don't understand why she's not falling asleep. 
- I have a theory. 
- I got the movie. 
Manny, why don't you go fire up some popcorn? 
You looking for these? 
- You took my shoes? 
- No, I took your freedom. 
Sorry, it ain't your night. 
Why are you being like this? 
I just wanted to go to that party for like two hours. 
I would have been back by now! 
Would that have killed you? ! 
She's just like her mother. 
Why are you treating Haley like this? 
Me? 
She's the one acting like a pill. 
You're taking this too personally. 
When I was Haley's age, I loved my grandfather, but I still wanted to go to parties and be with boys. 
I know, I know, so did Claire... and Mitchell. 
But you know what? 
You try to put something over on me, you're gonna lose. 
So what? 
Now you're gonna make this into a big game? 
I'm trying to keep them around a little bit longer, that's all. 
Who knows how many nights like this I got left? 
- I miss you already! 
- What's wrong with this kid tonight? 
Go in the kitchen and help out the guys, and I'll be right in. 
It's great that you want to spend time with your granddaughter, but is this really the way? 
Fine. 
You're a good abuelo. 
- She's upstairs. 
- I know. 
Get up. 
You're here to take Haley to the party, right? 
She's in the house. 
How did you know I was here? 
This is how I first met Phil. 
Thanks again, Grandpa. 
We'll be back by 11 : 00. 
- I will track you down. 
- I believe that. 
- What's that smell? 
- Sloppy Jays. 
Help yourself. 
There's plenty left. 
Sloppy Jays because your name's Jay. 
Right on. 
I can't believe she's into this guy. 
If you want, I'll fix you a plate. 
- Yeah, definitely. 
That'd be great. 
- What about the party? 
We can go in just a minute. 
Just let... 
Oh, no way! 
" The Gunfighter"! 
I love this movie! 
Dylan, the party. 
Oh, but... cowboys. 
Don't fight it, Haley. 
They never grow up. 
I'm going to the kitchen for an espresso. 
Anybody need anything? 
No, thanks. 
2, 3, 4. 
" The year was 1991. 
" America was immersed in Desert Storm." 
" Meanwhile, stateside, another storm was brewing... 
" in my heart." 
This is stupid, isn't it? 
Is it stupid, Phil? 
Just keep going, Claire. 
It's wonderful. 
" After a romantic dinner at Fratelli's, 
" a certain nervous young couple shared their first kiss 
" as the radio played this song." 
You know what? 
No, no. 
Sorry. 
- Sorry. 
Not gonna do it, no. 
- What's wrong? 
- What's going on? 
- Do you know the name of this song? 
- Right." True." -" True", of course. 
This is false. 
I'm not gonna play" True" for someone who's false. 
He doesn't even know the band. 
He's not a fan. 
Of course he does. 
Because this is our song. 
You love this song. 
Tell him this is our song. 
- Tell him, Phil. 
- It's not our song, Claire. 
Our song is" If You Leave" by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. 
Are you sure? 
Pretty sure. 
I sang it at our wedding. 
- Oh, I'm an idiot. 
- Well, actually, he's the idiot. 
He fell in love to a breakup song. 
Ignore him. 
This is beautiful. 
- I love it. 
- I hate this. 
I hate this. 
You're so sweet and nice, and I can't even give you a decent anniversary present. 
I love you so much, and I feel like you just are never gonna know it. 
- I know it. 
- You do know it? 
I know it. 
Yes. 
- You do? 
- And this is an awesome gift. 
- Do you know why? 
- Why? 
You just gave us a new song. 
Suppose it's all brought you back together, eh? 
Sort of. 
Rekindled fires of a dying passion? 
Sure. 
Shot a ray of hope into this gloomy suburban life? 
- All right, buddy. 
- Maybe you could just play it, Izzy. 
For you, Claire. 
- She is so sweet. 
- Isn't she? 
Like a little angel. 
Let me hold her. 
Oh, thank God. 
Millenium breaking disaster... 
All river traffic has been halted and police divers search for survivors. 
Harry Potter. 
Who's Harry Potter? 
Um, no one. 
Bit of a tosser, really. 
Funny that paper of yours. 
Couple of minutes ago, I could have sworn I saw a picture move. Really? 
While I was going around the train. 
- Okay, I was wondering- - - Eleven. 
That's when I get off. 
You can tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter. 
You've been reckless this summer, Harry. 
I like riding around the trains. 
Takes my mind off things. 
All unpleasant to be old, isn't it? 
The tale is thrilling, if I say so myself. 
But now is not the time to tell it. 
Take my arm. 
Do as I say. 
I hardly just Apparated, didn't I? 
Indeed. 
Quite successfully too, I might add. 
Most people vomit the first time. 
Can't imagine why. 
Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton. 
Harry, I assume right about now you must be wondering... why I brought you here? 
Am I right? 
Actually sir, after all these years, I just, sort of, go with it. 
Wands on, Harry. 
Merlin's beard! 
You don't need to disfigure me, Albus. 
Well I must say you made a very convincing armchair, Horace. 
It's all in the upholstery. I come by this stuffing naturally. What gave me away? 
Dragon's blood. 
Oh yes, introductions. 
Harry, I'd like you to meet an old friend and colleague of mine- - Horace Slughorn. 
Horace... 
Well you know who this is. 
Harry Potter. 
So for love of theatrics, Horace... 
You're, by any chance, waiting for someone else, were you? Someone else? 
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. 
The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year. 
Do you know what's that like? 
You can only say no to these people so many times. 
So I never stay anywhere more than a week. 
The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands. 
Well, I think we should put it back in order for them, - don't you? 
- Yes. Fine. 
That was fun. 
Do you mind if I use the loo? No, of course. 
Don't think I don't know why you're here, Albus. 
The answer is still no. 
Absolutely, and unequivanetly, no. 
You're very like your father. 
Except the eyes, of course. 
- You have your- - 
- My mother's eyes, yeah. 
Lily, lovely Lily. 
She's exceedingly bright, your mother. 
Even more impressive even though I could say that she was Muggle-born. 
One of my best friends is Muggle-born. 
- She's the best in our year. - Oh please don't think 
I'm prejudiced. No, no, no. 
Your mother was one of my absolute favorites. 
Look, there she is. Right at the front. 
All mine. Each and every one. 
Ex-students, I mean. 
You recognise Barnabas Cuffe? Editor of the Daily Prophet. 
Always takes my owl should I wish to register an opinion on the news of the day. 
Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies. 
Free tickets whenever I want them. 
Of course, I haven't been to a match in some time. 
Ah, yes! 
Regulus Black. 
No doubt, there is his older brother Sirius, died a few weeks ago. 
I taught the whole Black family, except Sirius. 
It's a shame. 
A talented boy. 
I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but... but I'd like to set. 
Horace! 
Do you mind if I take this? 
I do love knitting patterns. 
Yes, of course, but you're not leaving, are you? 
Oh, I think I know a lost cause when I see one. 
Regrettable, I would have considered it a very personal triumph if you consented to return to Hogwarts. 
Ah well, you're like my friend Mr. Potter here. One of a kind. 
Well, bye-bye Horace. 
Bye. 
Alright. I'll do it. 
But I want Professor Merrythought's old office, not the water closet I had before. 
And I expect a raise. 
These are mad times we're living, mad! 
They are, indeed. 
Sir, exactly what was all that about? 
You are talented, famous and powerful. 
Everything Horace values. 
Professor Slughorn's gonna try to collect you, Harry. 
You would be his crowning jewel. 
That's why he's returning to Hogwarts. 
And it's crucial he should return. 
I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. 
She was truthfully... very pretty. The girl. 
It's alright, sir. 
I'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse. 
Oh you'll not be returning to Little Whinging tonight, Harry. 
But sir, what about Hedwig? 
And my trunk? 
Both are waiting for you. 
Hedwig? 
Mom? 
Ginny, what is it? 
I was only wondering when Harry got here. 
What? Harry- 
- Harry, who? 
Harry Potter, of course. 
I think I'd know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn't I? 
His trunk's in the kitchen... and his owl. 
But no, dear. 
I seriously doubt that. 
Did someone say Harry? 
Is he up there with you? 
Of course not. 
I think I'll know if my best friend's in my room, wouldn't I? 
Is that an owl I heard? You haven't seen him, have you? 
Apparently, he's wandering about the house. 
- Really. 
Harry! 
What a lovely surprise! 
Why didn't you let us know you were coming? 
I didn't know. 
Oh, that man! 
What we won't do without him? 
A bit of... toothpaste. 
So when did you get here? A few days ago. 
Day or for a while, I wasn't sure I was coming. 
sort of lost it, last week. 
Said Ginny and I have no business going back to Hogwarts. 
It's too dangerous. 
Oh, come on. 
She's not alone. Even my parents. 
They're Muggles, know something bad's happening. Anyway, Dad stepped in. 
Told us she was being barmy and... 
Took a few days, but she came around. 
But, this is Hogwarts we're talking about. It's Dumbledore. 
What could be safer? 
There's been a lot of talk recently that... 
Dumbledore's got a bit old. What rubbish! 
Well, he's only... 
How old is he? 
150? 
Give or take a few years? 
Cissy, you can't do this! He can't be trusted. 
The Dark Lord trusts him. 
The Dark Lord is mistaken. 
Run along, Wormtail. 
I-I know I ought not to be here. 
The Dark Lord himself forbade me to speak of this. 
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you would not to speak. 
Put it down, Bella, we mustn't touch what isn't ours. 
As it, so happens, I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa. You? 
The Dark Lord told you? 
Your sister darts me. 
Understandable, over the years, I've played my part well. 
So well, I've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time. 
Dumbledore is a great wizard. 
Only a fool would question it. 
I don't doubt you, Severus. 
You should be honored, Cissy. 
As should Draco. 
He's just a boy. 
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind. 
But it might be possible for me to help Draco. 
Severus. 
Swear to it. 
Make the Unbreakable Vow. 
It's just empty words. 
You'll give it his best effort... 
when it matters most. 
He'll just slither back to his hole. 
Coward. 
Take out your wand. 
Will you, Severus Snape, watch over Draco Malfoy as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lord's wishes? 
I will. 
And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm? 
I will. 
And if Draco should fail, will you yourself carry out the deed the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform? 
I will. 
Step up, step up! 
We got fating fancies. 
- And he's made me go. 
- At just in for time for school. 
Puking Pastilles. 
Meeting's in the cauldron, Hanson. 
- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder. 
- How real many spinned it at that one? 
Handy if you need to make a quick getaway. 
Hello, ladies. 
Love potions, eh? Yeah. 
They really do work. 
Then again the way we heard you, sis... 
You're doing just fine on your own. Meaning? 
Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas? 
It's none of your business. 
- Five galleons. 
- Five galleons. 
How much for me? - Five galleons. 
- Five galleons. 
I'm your brother. 
- Ten galleons. - Ten galleons. 
Come on, let's go. 
Hi, Ron. 
Hi. 
How are Fred and George doing it? Half the alley's closed down. 
Fred reckons people need a laugh these days. 
I reckon he's right. 
Oh, no. 
Everyone got their wands from Ollivanders. 
Harry... 
Is it me or do Draco and Mummy look like two people who don't want to be followed? 
Quibbler! 
Quibbler. 
He's lovely. 
They've been known to sing at Boxing Day, you know? 
- Oh, please. 
What's a Wrackspurt? 
Invisible creatures, they flow in your ears and make your brain go fuzzy. 
Quibbler! 
So what was Draco doing with that weird-looking cabinet? 
And who were all those people? 
Don't you see? 
It was a ceremony. 
- An initiation. 
- Stop it, Harry. 
- I know where you're going with this. - It happened. 
- He's one of them. 
- One of who? 
Harry's under the impression Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater. 
You're barking. 
What would You-Know-Who want with a sod like Malfoy? 
Oh, then what's he doing in Borgin and Burkes? Browsing for furniture? 
It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy blood. 
Blood? 
His father is a Death Eater. 
It only makes sense. 
Besides, Hermione saw it with her own eyes. 
I told you, I don't know what I saw. 
I need some air. 
What is it? 
- I don't know. - What was that? 
Relax, boys. 
It's probably just a phantom messing around. 
Come, Draco. 
Sit down. We'll be at Hogwarts soon. 
Hogwarts. 
What a pathetic excuse for a school. 
I think I pitched myself off the astronomy tab I thought I had to continue for another 2 years. 
What's that supposed to mean? 
Let's just say I don't think I see me wasting my time in Charms class next year. 
Amused, Blaise? 
Let's see just who's laughing in the end. 
You two go on. 
Wanna check something. 
- Where's Harry? 
- He's probably on the platform. 
Come on. 
Didn't Mummy ever tell you it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter? 
Petrificus Totalus! 
Oh yeah... 
She was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin. 
That's for my father. 
Enjoy your ride back to London. 
Ennervate! 
Hello, Harry! Luna. 
How'd you know where I was? 
Wrapspurts, your head's full of them. 
Sorry I made you miss the carriages, by the way, Luna. 
That's alright. It was like being with a friend. 
Well, I am your friend, Luna. 
That's nice. 
Oh, about time. 
I've been looking all over for you two. 
Names? 
Professor Flitwick, you know me for five years. 
No exceptions, Potter. 
- Who are those people? 
- Aurors. 
Security. 
What's this cane here then? 
It's not a cane, you cretin. It's a walking stick. 
And what exactly will you be doing with all... be construed as an offensive weapon. 
It's alright, Mr. Filch. I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy. 
Nice face, Potter. 
Would you like me to fix it for you? 
Personally, I think you look a bit more... devil may care this way but... 
It's up to you. Well, have you ever fixed a nose before? 
No, but I've done several toes... 
How different are they really? 
Give it a go. 
Episkey! 
- How do I look? 
- Exceptionally ordinary. 
Brilliant! 
Hermione... 
I'm here in a minute. 
Will you stop eating? 
Your best friend is missing. 
Why won't you turn around, you lunatic? 
He's covered in blood again. 
Why is it he's always covered in blood? 
Looks like it's his own this time. 
Where have you been? 
What happened to your face? 
Later. 
What did I miss? 
The Sorting Hat says we ought to be brave and strong in these trouble times. 
Easy for it to say, though. 
It's a hat, isn't it? 
- Very best of evenings to you all. - Thanks. 
First off, let me introduce the newest member of our staff. 
Horace Slughorn. 
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post... as Potions Master. 
Meanwhile, the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts... will be taken by Professor Snape. 
As you know, each and every one of you were searched upon your arrival here tonight. 
And you have the right to know why. 
Once, there was a young man. 
Like you, sat in this very hall. 
Walked this castle's corridors. 
Slept under it's roof. 
You see, to all the world, a student like any other. 
His name : 
Tom Riddle. 
Today of course, is known all over the world by another name. 
Which is why as I stand, looking out upon you all tonight, 
I'm reminded of a sobering fact. 
Every day, every hour, this very minute, perhaps... dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle's walls. 
But in the end, that greatest weapon... is you. 
Just something to think about. 
Now off to bed, beep beep. 
That was cheerful. 
History of Magic is upstairs, ladies, not down. 
Mr. Davis, Mr. Davis, that is the girls' lavatory. 
Potter. 
Oh, this can't be good. 
Enjoying ourselves, are we? 
I had a free period this morning, Professor. 
So I noticed. 
I would think you would want to fill it with Potions. 
Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror? 
Well, it was, but I was told to have to get an Outstanding in my O.W.L. 
So you did, when Professor Snape was teaching Potions. 
However, Professor Slughorn's perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with" Exceeds Expectations". 
Brilliant, um... 
Well, I'll head there straight away. 
Oh, good, good. 
Potter, take Weasley with you. 
He looks far too happy over there. 
I don't want to take Potions. 
There's Quidditch trials coming up, I need to practice. 
Attention to detail in the preparation is the prerequisite of all plan. 
Harry, my boy, I've been beginning to worry. 
You brought someone with us, I see. 
Ron Weasley, sir. 
But I'm dead awful at Potions. 
A menace, actually so. 
I'm probably just gonna- - 
Nonsense, we'll sort you out. 
Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine. 
Get your books out. 
I'm sorry, sir, I haven't actually got my book yet and nor is Ron. 
Not to worry, get what you want from the cupboard. 
Now as I was saying, I prepared some concoctions this morning. 
Any ideas what these might be? 
- Yes, Miss...? - Granger, sir. 
That one there is Veritaserum. 
It's a truth-telling serum. 
And that one- - 
This is Amortentia. The most powerful love potion in the world. 
It's rumored to smell differently to each person according to what attracts them. 
For example, I smell... 
Freshly mown grass and new parchment and... 
Spearmint toothpaste. 
Now Amortentia doesn't create actual love. 
That would be impossible, but it does cause powerful infatuation or obsession. 
And for that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room. 
Sir, you haven't told us what's in that one. 
What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little potion, known as Felix Felicis. 
But it is more commonly known referred to as- - 
- Liquid luck. - Yes, Miss Granger. 
Liquid luck. 
Desperately tricky to make, disastrous should you get it wrong. 
One sip and you'll find that all of your endeavours succeed. 
At least until the effects wear off. 
So this is what I offer each of you today. 
One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student who in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable Draught of Living Dead. 
Recipes for which can be found on page 10 of your books. 
Issue one doubt, however. 
Only one set of student manage to brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize. 
Nevertheless, good luck to you all. 
Let the brewing commence. 
How did you do that? 
You crush it, don't cut it. 
No, the instructions specifically says to cut. 
No, really. 
Merlin's beard! 
It is perfect! 
So perfect I'd just say one drop would kill us all! 
Here we are then, as promised. 
One vial of Felix Felicis. 
Congratulations. 
Use it well. 
Oh Harry, you got my message? 
Come in. 
How are you? I'm fine, sir. 
Enjoying your classes? 
I know Professor Slughorn is most impressed with you. 
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir. Do you? 
Definitely. 
What about your activities outside the classroom? 
Sir? 
Well, I notice you've spent a great deal of time with Miss Granger. 
I can't help wondering if- - 
Oh, no, no, I mean... 
She's brilliant and we're friends. 
- But no. 
- Forgive me. 
I was only being curious. 
But enough chit-chat. 
You must be wondering why I summoned you here tonight. 
The answer lies here. 
What you're looking at are memories. 
In this case, pertaining to one individual : 
Voldemort. 
Or as he was known, then : Tom Riddle. 
This vial contains the most sufficient memory. 
On the day I first met him. 
I'd like you to see it. 
If you want. 
I'm to admit to some confusion for receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore. 
In all the years Tom's been here, he's never once had a family visitor. 
There have been incidents with the other children- - Nasty things. 
Tom, you have a visitor. 
How'd you do, Tom? 
Don't. 
You're the doctor, aren't you? 
No, I'm a professor. 
I don't believe you. 
She wants me looked at. 
They think I'm... different. 
Or perhaps they're right. 
I'm not mad. 
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people. 
Hogwarts is a school. 
School of magic. 
You can do things, can't you, Tom? 
Things other children can't. 
I can make things move without touching them. 
I can make animals do what I want without training them. 
I can make bad things happen to people who mean to me. 
Can make them hurt. 
If I want. 
Who are you? 
Well, I'm like you, Tom. 
I'm different. Prove it. 
I think there's something in your wardrobe trying to get out, Tom. 
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts, Tom. 
At Hogwarts, we'll be taught not only how to use magic, but how to control it. 
You understand me? 
I can speak to snakes too. 
They find me. 
Whisper things. 
Is that normal for someone like me? 
Did you know, sir, then? 
Did I know I just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? 
No. 
If I had, I... 
Over time while here at Hogwarts, 
Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher. 
Can you guess who that teacher might be? 
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back simply to teach potions, did you, sir? 
No, I did not. 
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something that I desire very dearly. 
He will not give it out easily. 
You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect to me. 
I did. 
Do you want me to let him? 
Yes. 
I'm gonna be putting you all for a few drills just to assess you straight. 
Quiet, please! 
Shut it! 
Thanks. 
Alright, um, now then, remember, just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year. 
Is that clear? 
Good. 
No hard feelings, Weasley, alright? 
Hard feelings? 
Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper's, well, It's... 
nothing personal. 
Really? 
Such a big guy like you? You've got more of a Beater's build, don't you think? 
Keepers need to be quick, agile. 
I'll have my chances. 
Say, um, you think you could introduce me to your friend, Granger? 
Wouldn't mind, eh, getting on a first-hand base, you know what I mean? 
Confundus. 
He's brilliant. 
I have to admit I thought I was going to miss that last one. 
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard. 
He's got a bit of a thing for you, Hermione- - Cormac. 
He's vile. 
Have you ever heard of the spell : Sectumsempra? 
No, I haven't. 
If you had a shred of self-respect, you'd hand that book in. 
Not bloody likely. 
He's top of the class. He's even better than you, Hermione. 
Slughorn thinks he's a genius. 
I'd like to know who's that book was. 
- Let's have a look, shall we? 
- No. 
Why not? The binding is fragile. 
" The binding is fragile"? 
Yeah. 
- Who's the Half-Blood Prince? 
- Who? 
That's what it says right here. This book is property of the Half-Blood Prince. 
For weeks, you carry around this book. 
Practically, sleep with it, and yet you have no desire to find out who the Half-Blood Prince is. 
I didn't say I wasn't curious and I don't sleep with it. 
Well, it's true. 
Well, I got a nice chat before I go to bed. And all you do is that bloody book. 
It's like being with Hermione. 
Well, I was curious So, I went to- - 
- The library? - The library? 
And? 
And nothing. 
I couldn't find a reference anywhere to the Half-Blood Prince. 
There we go. 
That settles it, then. 
Yeah, uh... hoping to find you in the Three Broomsticks. 
Uh no, emergency choir practice from the freighthorse. 
Does anyone fancy a butterbeer? 
A chum of mine was sledging down Clagsby Hill. 
We had a very long, home-made Norwegian style sledge. 
We hurtled down, we hit what most... 
Ron, sit aside me. 
Okay. 
Something to drink? 
Three butterbeers and some ginger in mine, please. 
Oh, bloody hell. 
Ron, see they're only holding hands. 
And snogging. 
- I'd like to leave. 
- What? 
You can't be serious. 
- That happens to be my sister. 
- So? 
What if she looked at me and saw you snogging me? 
Would you expect her to get up and leave? - Hey, my boy. 
- So wonderful to see you. 
And you, and you. 
So what brings you here? 
Oh, Three Broomsticks and I go way back further than I care to admit. 
I could remember when it was One Broomstick. 
All hands on deck, Granger. 
Listen, my boy, in the old days, I used to throw together the occassional supper party. 
Select a student or two. 
Would you be game? 
I consider it an honor, sir. 
You'd be welcome too, Granger. 
- I'd be delighted, sir. 
- Splendid! 
Look for my owl. 
Good to see you, Wallenby. 
What are you playing at? 
Dumbledore's asked me to get to know him. 
- Get to know him? - Dunno. 
It must be important. If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask. 
You got a little bit... 
Katie, we don't know what it could be. 
- Harry, what... - I know what I'm doing. 
Did you hear what she was saying back in the pub there on me and her snogging? 
I warned her. 
I warned her not to touch it. 
Don't get any closer! Get back, all of you. 
Do not touch that, except for the wrappings. 
Do you understand? 
You're sure Katie did not have this in her possession when she entered the Three Broomsticks? 
It's like I said. 
She left to go to the loo. 
And when she came back, she had the package. 
She said it was important that she deliver it. 
- Did she say to whom? 
- To Professor Dumbledore. 
Very well. 
Thank you, Leanne. 
You may go. 
Why is it when something happens, it is always you three? 
Believe me, Professor, 
I've been asking myself the same question for six years. 
Oh, Severus. 
What do you think? 
I think Ms. Bell is lucky to be alive. 
She was cursed, wasn't she? 
I know Katie. 
Off the Quidditch pitch, she wouldn't hurt a fly. 
If she was delivering that to Professor Dumbledore, she wasn't doing it knowingly. 
Yes, she was cursed. 
It was Malfoy. 
That is a very serious accusation, Potter. 
Indeed. 
Your evidence? 
I just know. 
You" just" know. 
Once again, you're astonished with your gifts, Potter. 
Gifts mere mortals can only dream of possessing. 
How grand it must be to be the Chosen One. 
I suggest you go back to your dormitories. 
All of you. 
What do you suppose Dean sees in her- - Ginny? 
And what does she see in him? 
Dean- - He's brilliant. 
You called him slick git not five hours ago. 
Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he? 
Something snaps. You've got to hate him, you know? 
Old principle. 
I suppose. 
So what do you think he sees in her? 
I don't know. 
She's smart, funny, attractive- - 
Attractive? 
You know, she's got nice skin. 
Skin? You're saying Dean's dating my sister because of her skin? 
For blood, I mean. I'm just--I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor. 
Hermione's got nice skin. 
When you say it, as skin goes, I mean. 
I've never really thought about it. 
But I suppose, yeah. 
Very nice. 
I think I'll be going to sleep now. 
Right. 
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything of your uncle Tiberius these days? 
Yes, sir, in fact I'm meant to get hunting with him and the Minister of Magic over the holidays. 
Oh, well, be sure to give them both my best. 
And what about your uncle, Belby? 
For those of you who don't know well, Marcus' uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion. 
Is he working on anything new? 
I don't know. 
He and my dad don't get along. 
'Prolly cause my dad says potions are rubbish. 
His only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the day. 
And what about you, Ms. Granger, what exactly does your family do in the Muggle world? 
My parents are dentists. 
They attend to people's teeth. 
Fascinating. 
And is that considered a dangerous profession? 
No. 
Although, one boy, Robby Fenwich, did bite my father once. 
He needed ten stitches. 
Ah, Ms. Weasley. 
Come in, come in. 
Look, her eyes. 
They've been fighting again. Her and Dean. 
Sorry, I'm not usually late. 
No matter, just in time for dessert. 
That is if Belby has left you any. 
- What? 
- Nothing. 
Goodbye. 
Bye-bye. 
Potter! 
I'm sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass. 
Ah yes, most intriguing object. 
The sand runs in accordance with the quality of the conversation. 
It is stimulating, the sand runs slowly. 
- If it is not... 
- I think I'll be going, then. 
Nonsense. 
You have nothing to fear, dear boy. 
Actually, some of your classmates... 
Well, let's just say they're unlikely to make the shelf. 
Shelf, sir? 
Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here. 
But then again, you already are someone, aren't you, Harry? 
You knew him, didn't you, sir? 
Tom Riddle? 
You were his teacher. 
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers who was here at Hogwarts. 
What was he like? 
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me. 
He killed my parents. 
Of course, it's only natural you should want to know more. 
But I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Harry. 
When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was a quiet, albeit brilliant boy, committed to becoming a first-grade wizard. 
Not unlike others I've known. 
Not unlike yourself, in fact. 
If the monster existed, it was very deep within. 
I'm counting on you, Ron. 
I've 2 games on Gryffindor, ya? 
- So how was it, then? 
- How is what? 
- Your dinner party? 
- Pretty boring actually. 
But I think Harry enjoyed dessert. 
Slughorn's having Christmas, do you know? 
I'm about to bring someone. 
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen. 
He's in the Slug Club, isn't he? 
Actually, I was going to ask you. 
Really? 
Good luck today, Ron. 
I know you'll be brilliant. 
I'm resigning. 
After today's match, McLaggen can have my spot. 
Are you alright? 
- Juice? - Sure. 
Hello, everyone. 
You look dreadful, Ron. 
Is that why you put something in his cup? 
Is it a tonic? 
Liquid luck. 
Don't drink it, Ron. 
- You could be expelled for that. 
- What are we talking about? 
Come on, Harry, we've got a game to win. 
You shouldn't have done it. 
I know. 
I supposed I could have just used the Confundus charm. 
That was different. 
That was try-outs, this was a natural game. 
You didn't put in? 
Ron only thought you did. 
Charm spell. 
Just practising. 
Very good. 
How does it feel, Harry? 
When you see Dean with Ginny? 
I know. 
I see the way you look at her. 
You're my best friend. 
Oops! I think this room's taken. 
What's with the birds? 
Oppugno. 
It feels like this. 
I can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist. 
What Lav and I have, well, let's just say, there's no stopping it. 
It's chemical. 
Will it last? 
Who knows? 
Point is I'm a free agent. 
He's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes. 
I really couldn't care less. 
Was I under the impression he and I would be attending Slughorn's Christmas party together? 
Yes. 
Now, given the circumstances, I had to make other arrangements. 
- Have you? 
- Yes. 
Why? 
Well, I just thought seeing is not the risk at going with who we'd really like to, 
We should go together, as friends. 
Why didn't I think of that? 
Who are you going with? 
Um, it's a surprise. 
Anyways, you have got to worry about. 
You can't take anyone. 
You see that girl over there? 
That's Romilda Vane. 
Harry, she's been been trying to smuggle you a love potion. 
Really? 
Hey! She's only interested in you because she thinks you're the Chosen One. 
But I am the Chosen One. 
Okay, sorry, um... 
Kidding. 
I'll ask someone I like. 
Someone cool. 
I've never been to this part of the castle. 
At least, not while awake. 
I sleep-walk, you see. 
That's why I wear shoes to bed. 
Harmonia nictere passus. 
Harmonia nictere passus. 
Harmonia nictere passus. 
Drink? 
Neville. 
I didn't get into the Slug Club. 
It's okay, though. 
He's got Melvin hanging up towels in the looroom. 
I'm--I'm fine, mate. Thanks. Okay. 
Hermione, what are you doing? 
What happened to you? 
No, I've just escaped. 
I mean, I left Cormac under the mistletoe. 
Cormac? 
That's who you invited? 
I thought it would annoy Ron the most. 
We will catch up with you. He's got more tentacles than a Snargaluff plant. 
- Dragon tails? 
- No, I'm fine, thank you. 
Just this one. They give one horribly bad breath. 
On second thoughts, it might keep Cormac away. 
God, here he comes. 
I think she just went to paddle her nose. 
She's a little minx, your friend. 
Nice to work. 
How nasty isn't she? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
What is this I'm eating, by the way? 
Dragon balls. 
You've just brought yourself a month's detention, McLaggen. 
Not so quick, Potter. 
Sir, I really think I should rejoin the party. 
Can surely survive your absence for another minute or two. 
Besides, I only wish to convey a message. 
- Message? 
- From Professor Dumbledore. 
He asked me to give you his best and he hopes you enjoy your holidays. 
He's travelling. 
And he won't return until term resumes. 
Travelling where? 
Get your hands off me, you filthy Squibb. 
Professor Slughorn, sir. 
I just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. 
He claims to have been invited to your party. 
Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing. 
Happy? 
I'll escort him out. 
Certainly, Professor. 
Alright, everyone carry on, carry on. 
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. 
Maybe I didn't. 
What about you? 
I swore to protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow. 
I don't need protection. 
I was chosen for this. 
I don't know what all this mean, 
- but I won't fail him. 
- You're afraid, Draco. 
You attempt to consider, but it's obvious, 
- let me assist you. 
- No. I was chosen. 
This is my moment. 
Unbreakable Vow. 
You sure that's what Snape said? 
Positive. 
Why? It's just, you can't break an Unbreakable Vow. 
I-I worked that much out for myself, funny enough. 
I don't understand. 
Oh bloody hell. 
I miss you. 
Lovely. 
All she wants to do is snog me. 
My lips are getting chapped, look. 
Then I'll take your word for it. 
So what happens to you? 
What happens if you break an Unbreakable Vow? 
You die. 
Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission? 
- I know it sounds mad. - Has it occured to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help so he could find out what he was up to? 
Ginny! 
That's not what it sounded like. 
Perhaps Harry is right, Remus. 
I mean, to make an Unbreakable Vow- - 
It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore's judgement. 
Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore, I do. 
Dumbledore can make mistakes. 
- He said so himself. 
- You are blinded by hatred. 
- I'm not. - Yes, you are. 
People are disappearing, Harry. 
Daily. We could only place our trust in a handful of people. 
If we started fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed. 
Ginny! 
Open up, you. 
Don't you trust me? 
It's good. 
Just, uh, get... 
- Pie? 
- Not for me. No. 
You'll have to forgive Remus. 
It takes its toll, his condition. 
Are you alright, Mr. Weasley? 
We're being followed, all of us. 
Most days, Molly doesn't leave the house. 
It's not been easy. 
Did you get my owl? 
Yes, I did. 
If Dumbledore is traveling, then perhaps news to the Ministry, but perhaps that's the way Dumbledore wants it. 
As for Draco Malfoy... 
I know a bit more. 
- Go on. - I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes. 
I think from what you described... 
What you and Ron saw at the end of summer, the object that Draco is so interested in, 
is a Vanishing Cabinet. 
A" Vanishing Cabinet"? 
They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power. 
You can see the appeal. 
Should the Death Eaters come knocking, one simply have to slip inside and disappear for an hour or two. 
It transports you practically anywhere. 
Tricky contraptions, though. 
Very temperamental. 
What happened to it? 
The one at Borgin and Burkes? 
Nothing. 
It's still there. 
It was delicious, Molly, really. 
Are you sure you won't stay? 
No, we should go. 
The first night of the cycle's always the worst. 
Remus? 
Sweetheart. 
Has Ron gone to bed? 
Um, not yet. No. 
Shoelace... 
Merry Christmas, Harry. 
Merry Christmas. 
- Harry, no! 
- Harry! 
Ginny! 
I killed Sirius Black! 
I killed Sirius Black! 
You coming to get me? 
Get me! He's trying to get me! 
Harry? 
Harry! 
Molly. 
It's so easy for them to get to you. 
You're bloody lucky you weren't killed. 
You have to realise who you are, Harry! 
I know who I am, Hermione, alright. 
Sorry. 
Hon, go somewhere. 
That's my Won-Won. 
Excuse me, I have to go and vomit. 
... Always you ruin half the start. 
Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring? 
Tom, I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I? 
And by the way, thank you for the pineapple. You're quite right. It is my favorite. 
But how did you know? 
Intuition. 
Good gracious, is it that time already? 
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention. 
Look sharp, Tom. 
Don't be caught out of bed after hours. 
Is something on your mind, Tom? 
Yes, sir. 
See, I couldn't think of anyone else to go to. 
The other professors... Well, they're not like you. 
They might misunderstand. 
Go on. 
I was in the library the other night. 
In the restricted section. 
And I picked something rather odd about this rare magic. 
I thought perhaps, you could illuminate me. 
It's called, as I understand it, Hor... 
I beg your pardon? 
I don't know anything about such things and if I did, I wouldn't tell you. 
Now get out of here at once and don't let me ever catch you mentioning them again! 
Confused? 
I'd be surprised if you weren't. 
I don't understand. 
What happened? 
This is perhaps the most important memory I had collected. 
It is also a lie. 
This memory has been tempered with by the same person whose memory it is. 
Our old friend, Professor Slughorn. 
But why would he temper with his own memory? 
I suspect he's ashamed of it. 
Why? 
Why, indeed. 
I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you had done so. 
Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory. 
Any way you can. 
I don't know him that well, sir. 
This memory is everything. 
Without it, we are blind. 
Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance. 
You have no choice. 
You must not fail. 
I highly recommend, reacquaint yourself with the chapter on antidotes. 
Now, I'll tell you more about bezoars in our next class. 
Right, off you go. Elise, don't forget your rat tail. 
Aha! 
It isn't the Prince of Potions himself! 
What do I owe this pleasure? 
Oh, sir, I wondered if I wanted to ask you something. 
Ask away, dear boy. 
Well, you see the other day, I was in the library in the restricted section, and I came across something rather odd about a very rare piece of magic. 
Yes, what was this rare piece of magic? 
Well, I don't know, but I can't remember the name exactly. 
But it just got me wondering, are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach us? 
I'm Potions Master, Harry, I think your question better be posed to Professor Snape. 
Yes, he and I don't exactly see eye-to-eye, sir. 
What I mean to say is... 
Well, he's not like you. 
He might misunderstand. 
Yes, it would be no light without the dark. 
And so it is with magic, myself I always strive to live within the light. 
I suggest you do the same. 
Is that what you told Tom Riddle, sir, when he came asking questions? 
Dumbledore put you up to this, didn't he? 
Didn't he? 
Yes? 
Oh, it's you, Potter. 
That's beautiful, isn't it? 
The moon. 
Divine. 
Had ourselves a little late night snack, did we? 
It was on your bed, the box. 
I just thought I'd try one. 
Or twenty? 
I can't stop thinking about her, Harry. 
Honestly, you know, I reckon she was starting to annoy you. 
She could never annoy me. 
I think I love her. 
Well, brilliant. 
Do you think she knows I exist? 
I very well hope so. 
She's been snogging you for three months. 
Snogging? 
Who are you talking about? 
Who are you talking about? 
Romilda, of course. 
Romilda Vane. 
Okay, very funny. 
What was that for? 
It's no joke. 
- I'm in love with her! 
- Alright, fine. 
You're in love with her. Have you ever actually met her? 
No. Can you introduce me? 
Come on, Ron. 
I will introduce you to Romilda Vane. 
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely essential. 
- Where's Romilda? 
- What's the matter with Wimby? 
Very powerful love potion. 
Very well, better bring him in. 
I always thought you could whip up a remedy for this is in no time, Harry. 
Well, I-I thought this called for more practised hands, sir. 
Hello, darling. 
Fancy a drink? Perhaps, you're right. 
I'm sorry, by the way, Professor, about earlier today. 
Our misunderstanding. 
Oh, not at all. 
Old water under the bridge, you know. 
Well, I expect you're tired a bit, after all these years. 
And the questions about Voldemort. 
Don't use that name! 
Here you go, boy. 
Bottom's up. 
- What's this? 
- Tonic for the nerves. 
What happened to me? 
- A love potion. 
- A bloody strong one at there. 
- I feel really bad. 
- You need to pick me up, my boy. 
Got butterbeer, wine, dazzling oak-matured mead. 
I had other intentions for this, but I think, given the circumstances. 
Here you are, Potter. 
To life! 
Ron! 
Ron! 
Professor, do something. 
I-I don't understand! 
Come on, Ron, breathe! 
These girls... They're gonna kill me. 
Quick thinking on your part, Harry, using a bezoar. 
You should be very proud of your student, Horace. 
Ah, yes. Very proud. 
I think we agree Potter's actions were heroic. 
The question is : Why were they necessary? 
I, indeed. 
This appears to be a gift, Horace. 
You don't remember who gave you this bottle? 
By the way, it possesses remarkably subtle hints of liquorice and cherry. 
When not polluted with poison. 
Actually, I had intended to give it as a gift, myself. 
To whom, might I ask? 
To you, headmaster. 
Where is he? 
Where's my Won-Won? 
Has he been asking for me? 
What's she doing here? 
I might ask you the same question. 
I happen to be his girlfriend. 
And I happen to be his... 
Don't make me laugh. 
You haven't spoken in weeks. 
I suppose you want to make up with him now that he's suddenly all interesting. 
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! 
And for the record, I've always found him interesting. 
See? 
He senses my presence. 
Don't worry, Won-Won. 
I'm here. 
I'm here. 
Hermione. 
Hermione. 
Oh to be young and to feel love's keen sting. 
Well, come over, everybody. 
Mr. Weasley's well attended. 
About time, don't you think? 
Thank you. 
Just shut up. 
Stop it, Ron. 
You're making it snow. 
Tell me how I broke up with Lavender again. 
Well, she came to visit you in the hospital. 
And you talked. 
I don't believe it was a particularly long conversation. 
Don't get me wrong. I'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her's. 
She seems a bit... put out. 
Yes, um... She does, isn't she? 
You say you don't remember anything from that night. 
Anything at all? 
There is something. 
It can't be. 
I was completely boggled, didn't I? 
Boggled. 
Harry... 
That's Katie. 
Katie Bell. 
Katie, how are you? 
I know you're going to ask, Harry. 
But I don't know who cursed me. 
I've been trying to remember. 
But I just can't. 
I know what you did, Malfoy. 
You hexed it, didn't you? 
Sectumsempra! 
You have to get rid of it. 
Today. 
Take my hand. 
It's the Room of Requirement. 
We need to hide the Half-Blood Prince's book. Where no one'll ever find it. 
Including you. 
- What was that? - What was that? 
See, you never know what you'll find up here. 
Alright, close your eyes. That way you can't be tempted. 
Close your eyes. 
That can stay hidden up here too if you like. 
So, did you and Ginny do it then? 
What? 
Well, hide the book? 
Oh, yeah. 
Still no luck with Slughorn then, I take it? 
Luck. 
That's it. 
All I need is a bit of luck. 
Well, how do you feel? 
Excellent. 
Really excellent. 
Remember, Slughorn usually leaves early, takes a walk, and then returns to his office. 
Right. 
I'm going down to Hagrid's. 
What? 
No, Harry, you've got to go to speak to Slughorn. 
We have a plan. 
I know but I've got a really good feeling about Hagrid's. 
I feel it's--it's the place to be tonight. Do you know what I mean? 
- No. - No. 
Well, trust me. I know what I'm doing. 
Or Felix does. 
- Merlin's beard, Harry! 
- Sorry, sir. I should have announced myself. 
Clear my throat. Coughed. 
You probably thought I was Professor Sprout? 
Definitely. 
What makes you think? 
Ah well, just your general behaviour, sir. 
Just sneaking around, jumping when you saw me. 
- Are those tentacular leaves, sir? 
- Yes. 
Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer. 
Not that I'm familiar with any such back alley transactions but one does hear rumours. 
My only interests are purely academical. 
I mean, personally, these plants always kinda freak me out. 
Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry? 
Through the front door, sir. 
I'm off to Hagrid's, you see. He's a very dear friend and I just fancy paying him a visit. 
So if you don't mind, I will be going now. 
- Harry! 
- Sir? It's nearly nightfall. 
Surely, you realise I can't allow you to go roaming the grounds by yourself. 
Well then, by all means, come along, sir. 
Harry, I must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately! 
That would be counterproductive, sir. 
And what makes you say that? 
No idea. 
Merlin's beard! 
Is that an actual Acromantula? 
A dead one, I think, sir. 
Good God. 
Dear fellow, however did you manage to kill it? 
" Kill it"? 
My oldest friend, he was. 
I'm so sorry, I didn't- - 
Ah, don't worry yourself. You're not alone. 
Seriously misunderstood creatures, spiders are. 
The eyes I reckon, they unnerve some folk. 
Not to mention the pincers. 
Yeah, I reckon that too. 
The last thing I wish to be is indelicate but Acromantula venom is uncommonly rare. 
Would you allow me to extract a vial or two, purely for academic purposes, you understand? 
Well I don't suppose it's gonna do him much good now is it. 
My thoughts exactly. 
I have a ampoule or two about my person for just such occassions as this. 
Old... Potion master's habit, you know? 
I wish you could have seen him with his prime. 
Magnificent, he was. 
Just magnificent. 
Would you like me to say a few words? 
Had a family, I trust? 
Oh, yeah. 
- Farewell... 
Farewell, Aragog. 
King of the arachnids. 
Your body will decay... but your spirit lingers on and your human friends find solace, the loss they have sustained. 
# Laid to rest, # 
# And his wand, snapped in two, # 
# Which was sad, # 
I had him from an egg, you know? 
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched. 
No bigger than a Pekingese. 
A Pekingese, mind you. 
How sweet! 
I once had a fish. 
Francis. He was very dear to me. 
One afternoon, I came downstairs and... it vanished. 
Poof. 
That's very odd, isn't it? 
Yes, doesn't it? 
But that's life! 
I suppose, you--you go along with and suddenly... 
poof. 
Poof. 
Poof. 
It was a student who gave me Francis. 
One spring afternoon, I discovered the bowl on my desk... 
With just a few inches of clear water in it... 
And floating on the surface was a flower petal. 
As I watched, it sank. 
But just before it reached the bottom, it transformed into a wee fish. 
It was beautiful magic. 
Wondrous to behold. 
The flower petal had come from a lily. 
Your mother. 
The day I came downstairs, day's the bowl was empty. 
That's the day your mother... 
I know why you're here. But I can't help you. 
It would ruin me. 
Do you know why I survived, Professor? 
The night I got this? 
Because of her, because she sacrificed herself... 
Because she refused to step aside. 
Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort. 
- Don't say his name. 
- I'm not afraid of the name, Professor. 
I'm going to tell you something. 
Something others have only guessed at. 
It's true. 
I am the Chosen One. 
Only I can destroy him, but in order to do so, 
I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you all those years ago in your office and I need to know what you told him. 
Be brave, Professor. 
Be brave like my mother. 
Otherwise, you disgrace her. 
Otherwise, she died for nothing. 
Otherwise, the bowl will remain empty. 
Forever. 
Please, don't think badly of me when you say it. 
I had no idea what he was like, even then. 
I was in the library the other day. 
In the restricted section... and I read something rather odd about this rare magic. 
It's called, as I understand it, a Horcrux. 
- I beg your pardon? 
I came across the term while reading... and I didn't fully understand it. 
I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but this is very dark stuff. 
Which is... why I came to you. 
A horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul. 
But I don't understand how that works, sir. 
One splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object. 
By doing so, you are protected, should you be attacked and your body destroyed. 
Protected? That part of your soul which is hidden lives on. 
In other words, you cannot die. 
And how does one splits his soul, sir? 
I think you already know the answer to that, Tom. 
Murder. 
Yes, killing rips the soul apart and it is a violation against nature. 
Can you only split the soul once? 
For instance, isn't seven- - 
Seven? Merlin's beard, Tom! 
Isn't it bad enough to consider killing one person? 
To rip the soul in seven pieces! 
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom? 
All academic? 
Of course, sir. 
It'll be our little secret. 
Sir. 
This is beyond anything I imagined. 
Do you mean, sir, he succeeded, sir? 
- In making a Horcrux? 
- Oh yes, he succeeded, alright. 
- And not just once. 
- What are they exactly? It could be anything. 
Most common place of objects. 
A ring, for example, or a book. 
Tom Riddle's diary. 
It's a horcrux, yes. 
Four years ago when you saved Ginny Weasley's life in the Chamber of Secrets, you brought me this. 
I knew then, this was a different kind of magic. 
Very dark, very powerful. 
But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful... 
- And the ring? - Belonged to Voldemort's mother. 
Difficult to find. Even more difficult to destroy. 
But if you could find them all, if you did destroy each Horcrux- - 
One destroys Voldemort. 
How would you find them? 
They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they? 
True, but magic, especially dark magic... leaves traces. 
It's where you've been going, isn't it, sir? 
When you leave the school. 
Yes, and I think perhaps, I may have found another. 
But this time, I cannot hope to destroy it alone. 
Once again, I must ask too much of you, Harry. 
Have you ever considered that you ask too much, that you take too much for granted? 
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don't want to do this anymore? 
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant. 
I will not negotiate with you, Severus. 
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss. 
Oh, Harry... 
You need a shave, my friend. 
You know, at times, I forget how much you've grown. 
At times, I still see the small boy from the cupboard. 
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry. 
You still look the same to me, sir. 
Just like your mother, you are unfailingly kind. 
A trait people never fail to undervalue, I'm afraid. 
The place to which we journey tonight is extremely dangerous. 
I promise you for the company of me and I stand by that promise. 
You must obey every command I give you without question. 
Yes, sir. 
You do understand what I'm saying. 
Should I tell you to hide, you hide. 
Should I tell you to run, you run. 
Should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself, you must do so. 
Your word, Harry. 
My word. 
Take my arm. 
Sir, I thought you couldn't Apparate within Hogwarts. 
Well, being me has its privileges. 
This is the place. 
Oh, yes. This place has known magic. 
Sir. In order to gain passage, payment must be made. 
Payment intended to weaken any intruder. 
You should have let me, sir. No, no, Harry. 
Your blood's much more precious than mine. 
Voldemort would not have made it easy to discover his hiding place. 
He would put certain defenses in position. 
Careful. 
There it is. 
The only question is how do we get there? 
If you would, Harry. 
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir? 
Oh, yes. 
It has to be drunk. 
All of it has to be drunk. 
You remember the conditions on which I brought you with me? 
This potion might paralyze me. 
I may risk to get what I'm here. 
I'd cause me so much pain that I'd beg for relief. 
You are not to indulge these requests. 
It's your job, Harry, to make sure I keep drinking this potion. 
Even if you have to force it down my throat. 
Understood? Why can't I drink it, sir? 
Because I'm much older, much cleverer and much less valuable. 
Your good health, Harry. 
Professor. 
Professor! 
Professor. 
Can you hear me? 
Professor! 
You have to keep drinking like you said, remember? 
- Stop. - I will stop. 
I will stop. 
But only- - only if you keep drinking. 
- Don't make me- 
- Kill me. - I'm sorry, sir. 
Kill me! 
All my fault. 
Just one more, sir. One more, I promise. 
- I promise I'll do what you say. 
- No, no. I promise! 
Please! 
Harry. 
Water. 
- Water. - Water. 
Look, you did it, sir. Look. 
Harry... water. 
Aguamenti! 
Water. 
Lumos. 
Lumos maxima! 
Sectumsempra! 
- Harry... - Incarcerous! 
- Stupefy! - Harry... 
Go to your houses! 
No toddling! 
We need to get you to the hospital wing, sir. 
To Madam Pomfrey. 
No... 
Severus, Severus is awakening. 
Wake him. 
Speak to no one else. 
Severus, Harry. 
Hide yourself below, Harry. 
Don't speak or be seen by anybody without my permission. 
Whatever happens, it's imperative you stay below. 
Harry, do as I say. 
Trust me. 
Trust me. 
Good evening, Draco. 
What brings you here on this fine spring evening? 
Who else is here? 
I heard you talking. I often talk aloud to myself. 
I find it extraordinarily useful. 
Have you always been to yourself, Draco? 
Draco, you are no assassin. 
How do you know what I am? I've done things that would shock you. 
Oh, like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in return she would bear a cursed necklace to me? 
Like replacing a bottle of mead with one lace with poison. 
Forgive me, Draco, I cannot help feel these actions are so weak that your... heart can't really have been in. 
He trusts me. 
I was chosen. 
I shall make it easy for you. 
Expelliarmus! 
Very good. 
Very good. 
You're not alone. 
There are others. 
How? 
The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement. 
I've been mending it. 
Let me guess, it has a sister. 
A twin. In Borgin and Burkes. 
- They form a passage. 
- Ingenious. 
Draco, years ago, I knew a boy who made all the wrong choices. 
Please let me help you. 
I don't want your help. 
Don't you understand? 
I have to kill you. 
Or he's gonna kill me. 
Oh, look what we have here. 
Well done, Draco. 
Good evening, Bellatrix. 
I think introductions aren't over, don't you? 
Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid we're on a bit of tight schedule. 
Do it! 
He doesn't have the stomach. 
Just like his father. 
Let me finish him in my own way. 
No, the Dark Lord was clear the boy has to do it. 
This is your moment, Draco. 
Do it! Go on, Draco, now! 
No. 
Severus. 
Please... 
Avada Kedavra. 
Hagrid! 
Snape, he trusted you! 
Incarcerous! 
Fight back, you coward! Fight back! 
No, he belongs to the Dark Lord. 
Sectumsempra! 
You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? 
Yes, I'm the Half-Blood Prince. 
Potter... 
Enlighten what has happened. 
If you should have the need to talk to someone... 
You should know... Professor Dumbledore... 
You meant a great deal to him. 
Do you think he would have done it? Draco. 
No. 
No, he was lowering his wand. 
In the end, it was Snape. 
It was always Snape. 
I did nothing. 
It was fake. 
Open it. 
To the Dark Lord : 
I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret. 
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. 
I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more. 
R.A.B. 
- R.A.B.? 
- Don't know. 
But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux. 
It means it was all a waste. 
All of it. 
Ron's okay with you, you know. 
You and Ginny. 
If I were you when he's around, I'd keep snogging to a minimum. 
I'm not coming back, Hermione. 
I got to finish whatever Dumbledore started. 
And I don't know where that'll leave me, but I'll let you and Ron know where I am... when I can. 
I've always admired your courage, Harry. 
But sometimes, you can be really thick. 
You don't really think you're going to be able to find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you? 
You need us, Harry. 
I never realised how beautiful this place was. 
You're always sick. 
You were sick when you were my age. 
Evening, sir. 
Evening, Victor. 
I didn't realized that you're still here. 
I'm just keeping James company, sir. 
If that's all right... 
Very kind of you. 
- Are you better, son? 
- Still cold, Father. 
It's just a mild fever. You'll be all right in the morning. 
- You always say that. 
- And you always pull through, don't you? 
Now... take your medicine. 
Elizabeth! 
Elizabeth! 
Your father's drunk again. 
You should help it home, Victor. 
It's not my name he's calling, sir. 
- Father! 
- Stay where you are, James! 
Father! 
I told you never to come back here! 
James... 
There are things you don't understand. 
- Don't... - I need him them to know! 
Please no! 
- No... more... 
lies! James... 
UHNOOOO! 
James! 
He... he wasn't your father son. 
What are you? 
- I didn't mean it! I didn't... 
- Yes, you did! 
He deserved it! 
And you gave it to him. 
We're brothers, Jimmy. 
You realize that? 
Brothers protect each other. 
You have to be hard now. 
Hard that nothing can't ever touch us. 
I want to go home. 
We can't. 
We stick together no matter what. 
and take care of anyone who gets in our way. 
Can you do that little brother? 
They're coming... can you run? 
Keep on running. 
Don't look back. 
Back-to-back! 
Enough! 
Enough! 
Stand down, soldier! 
Stand down! 
Victor, NO! 
Ready! 
Aim! 
Wake me when it's over. 
Fire! 
My name is Major William Stryker. 
You were sentenced to death for decapitating a senior officer. 
Is that correct? 
Apparently we have some issues with authority... 
- just keep a * * * * on it. 
- Sir. 
The warden tells me that your sentence was carried out by a firing squad at 1000 hours 
- How'd that go? 
- It tickled. 
You boys tired of running? 
Tired of denying your... true nature? 
- What do you care? 
- Oh I care... 
I care cause I know how special you are. 
How valuable. 
Look. 
You can stay here, locked up like freaks of nature. 
Or you can join me. 
I'm putting together a special team with special privileges. 
Now tell me : how would you like to really serve your country? 
I know all of this weapon more than any other thing in the whole wide world in my whole life. 
How? 
It's memorable. 
Sure, it's a little bulky, tough to get on a plane 
You would bat a couple of swords at your ex-girlfriends wedding, 
They will never, ever forget it. 
That's funny, Wade. 
I didn't think you like girls. 
It's probably not as intimidating as having a gun or bone claws, or the... 
fingernails of a back lady... 
- Manicure? 
- Victor. 
Easy. 
Speaking of sharp, Fred got a new tattoo. 
- I'm concerned. 
- Oh Geez, Fred you just met her last night. 
- I love her. 
- You love her after one night? 
She's a gymnast. 
Bradley, take us ( her? it? ) down. 
Are you gonna puke? 
If we were meant to fly, we'd grow wings. Oh, don't worry man. 
Seen more people die driving than flying. 
How about from empaling? Hey, be nice. 
Or be approximation of nice. 
Would you like a bucket? 
- No. - Gentlemen, wheels down in Lagos in five. 
- Why are we here? 
- All in good time. 
Zero... 
- Victor, high ground lookup. 
- Having fun yet? 
- Fred. 
- Tank? 
- Tank. 
- Yeah, I like that. 
Great! 
Stuck in the elevator with five guys on a high protein diet. 
Oh Wade, dreams really do come true. 
You just shut it! 
You're up next. 
Thank you, sir. 
Look very nice today. 
It's the green. 
Brings out the seriousness in your eyes. 
- Oh my God, you ever shut up pal? - No. 
Not when I'm awake. 
Bradley? Top floor, please. 
Cover the elevator! The Elevator! 
Time to go to work. 
Okay! 
People are dead! 
If you didn't have that mouth on you Wade, you'd be the perfect soldier. 
Take the diamonds, they're yours. I don't want your diamonds. 
I want this. 
That? 
That is nothing. A souvenir. 
Where did you find it? 
I want the source. 
A small village, far inland, three days from here. 
Tell him that this rock is more valuable to me than his life. 
Ask him where he found it. 
He says it came from the sky. 
He's telling the truth. 
- You don't know their language, Logan. 
- It's a meteor fragment. 
I know what it is. 
I ask him where he found it. 
Sir, base wants to know our location. 
Shut him down. 
Tell him everyone here will die unless he tells me where he found the rock. 
- He says that it's sacred. 
- Okay, fine. 
Victor. 
Victor! 
Don't even think about it. 
We didn't sign on for this. 
Put him down. 
What are you doing? 
We finally got a good thing going here. 
Don't you screw this up. Enough. 
It's enough. 
We've done enough. 
Who do you think you are? 
This is what we do. 
Maybe you'd rather be... 
rotting' in a hole somewhere till they figure out a way to do us, is that it? Uh? 
I'm done. 
You coming? 
Jimmy! 
We can't just let you walk away! 
Jimmy! 
Jimmy! 
Why are you up so early? 
Come here. 
See you baby. 
Oh that's nice! Yeah! 
No. 
Come on. 
Hey, what do you do? 
You turn off the light, you win a prize. - Two tries for a buck. 
- Come on, I wanna do it! 
Um, that's obvious. 
That's two. 
- That's a stupid trick. 
- It's not a trick, man. 
C'mon. 
Bye! 
Show's over! 
I said show's over! 
The show is never over for us, Bradley. 
- Victor. 
- Aren't you gonna invite me in? 
Yeah. Come on in. 
You know, I've never said anything to anyone... about what happened. 
I'm living a totally different life now, but... 
No need to bring up the past. 
You know... 
I always thought it would be Wade coming knocking at my door. 
Well.. Wade's gone. 
I'm not afraid of you, Victor. 
I'm not afraid to die. 
How do you know? 
You've never tried it before. 
Was it the wars? 
- Which one? 
- All of' em. 
Tell me... 
It's just a scratch. 
Looks like we're gonna need new sheets again, baby. 
Yeah... 
Who the hell is this? 
It smells like government. 
My God! Haven't aged a day! 
Clean living. 
You remember Agent Zero. 
Still shooting first and asking questions later? 
You still chewing those cheap cigars? 
Boys, please. 
I have a job for you. 
- I already have a job. 
- Lumberjack! 
- Eighteen grand a year? 
- Eighteen five. 
Plus I haven't had to kill anyone in a while. 
- Start to miss it? 
- Right about now I am. 
Zero, back to the car. 
Attaboy. 
You know, I'm not proud about the way things ended between us. 
Conversation's over. 
Playing" Little house in the prairie" with a... school teacher? 
That just isn't you, Logan. And you would know, uh? 
I would. 
What do you want, Stryker? 
Bradley was killed three days ago. 
Wade, before that. 
I believe that someone is hunting down our whole team. 
Anyone else? 
As far as I know, Victor is safe. 
- Whoever it is, he's had names, addresses. 
- I can take care of myself. 
This is not about you, Logan. 
Country needs you. 
I am Canadian. 
I know you, Logan! 
I know who you are! 
What's wrong? 
Stryker came by today. 
Don't worry, I said no. 
Why is he bothering you after all this years? 
Because I'm the best there is at what I do. 
And what I do best is killing guys. 
You're not an animal, Logan. 
What you have is a gift. 
A gift? 
You can return a gift. 
Come on, fellas! 
- Stay in the car. 
- Just gonna ask nicely. 
Mind letting us go by? 
You in some kind of a hurry there, pal? Are you? 
- Just move your truck so we can go by... 
- Trying to have a conversation there, right! 
You start some, you better be ready to finish it. 
Hey guys, take it easy! 
- Your boyfriend's got a big mouth. - I know. 
Big temper too, so please, let us pass. 
Thank you! 
How do you do that? 
You know, powers of persuasion is a gift. I see... 
Do you uh... 
have those powers over me? 
You didn't stay in the car. Did you? 
Why is the moon so lonely? 
Why? 
Cause she used to have a lover. 
- You tell this to the kids? 
- No. 
His name was Kuekuatsheu and they lived in the spirit world together. 
Hah, it's a true story... 
And every night, they would wander the skies together. 
But one of the other spirits was jealous. 
Trickster, one of the moon from South. 
So he told Kuekuatsheu that the Moon asked for flowers. 
He told him to come to our world and pick up some wild roses. 
But Kuekuatsheu didn't know that once you leave the spirit world, you can never go back... 
And every night, he looks up in the sky and sees the moon and howls her name. 
But... He can never touch her again. Wow. 
Coo-coo-cachoo got screwed. 
Kuekuatsheu. 
Means the wolverine. 
What you doing, Logan? 
Kayla! 
You're not from around here, are you? 
What gave me away? 
- You got an insurance for this place? 
- Insurance? 
No. 
Too bad. 
Well, well, well... 
Look what the cat dragged in. 
Guys, whatever this is, take it outside. 
Why? 
Why? 
You don't call. You don't write. 
How else am I suppose to get your attention? 
I hate to say, James, but... frankly, I'm a little disappointed. 
Stay down. 
Tell me some, Jimmy, was she worth it? 
When are you gonna figure it out? We're not like them. 
I... am nothing like you. 
Sure you are. You just don't know it yet. 
- What do we got? 
- Bar fight. 
Multiple knife wounds. 
What! ? Is this a joke? 
The guy's fine. 
Where is he? 
I said where is he? I don't know--who he is. 
I can help you. 
Six years, I've been here. Noone know me and then you show up! 
- And the next day, she's dead! 
- I tried to warn you. 
- Why don't you told me it was Victor? 
- I didn't know! 
I swear on my son's life! 
Victor's appetites were becoming too public. 
I had to lock him out. 
He thought I betrayed him. 
Went AWOL ( absent without leave ). He said he was coming after all of us. 
You didn't come to warn me. You came to save your own ass. 
So what's your plan, captain? 
You can't beat him, Logan, you know you can't. 
I'm gonna find him and kill him. 
I can give you the tools to defeat him. 
- How we can still save the others. 
- You mean save yourself, right? 
I promise you two things : 
you'll suffer more pain than any other human can endure, but you'll have your revenge. 
I come with you, I'm coming for blood. 
No law. No code of conduct. 
You point me in the right direction and you get the hell out of my way. 
When it starts, whatever the reason is you're doing this, focus on that. 
Maybe it will help. 
Trust me, I've been through worse. 
No you haven't. 
We're ready. 
We're gonna make you indestructible, but first, we're gonna have to destroy you. 
Remember what we were looking for in Africa? I remember. 
Well I found it. 
It helped us create a metal coumpound so strong, that you will be able to withstand virtually anything. 
It's called Adamantium. 
I can't put Victor down myself, Logan. 
To kill him, you're gonna have to embrace the other side. 
Become the animal. 
Let's do this. 
I almost forgot. 
I want new ones. 
What do you want them to say? 
Wolverine. 
Generals! Welcome. 
General Munson. 
Today, we're gonna witness medical history. 
Today, we're gonna create Weapon X. X? 
Roman numeral, Ten. 
We are about to begin bonding Adamantium to Weapon X's skeleton. 
Let's begin. 
- We're brothers, Jimmy. 
- Logan! 
Body temperature is 190. And rising. 
Why is he rushing like that? 
Why isn't he sedated? 
Feel pain, just like the rest of us. Anesthesia won't work on him. 
That's why he had to volunteer. 
195. 
- Will he survive this? 
- I don't know. 
200. 
Son. 
Heartbeat, near maximum. 
- Blood pressure? 
- 260 180. 
He can make it. 
Victor! 
I love you. 
You're not an animal, Logan. 
It means the Wolverine. 
I guess he can die. 
Come on, Wolverine. Come back. 
Heart rate rising. 
Adamantium reservoir is depleted. 
No rejection. 
Procedure completed. 
We did it! 
We take him to the island? 
The island? 
No. 
The bonding works. 
We use his DNA for the XI. 
Erase his memory. 
Fry his brain. 
I think he heard you. 
Lockdown! 
Hunt him down... Take his head off. 
Travis! 
I think there is some naked man in the barn. 
Son. 
What in the hell are you doing? 
- It's cold. 
- Cold? 
- You got no clothes on. 
- Yeah. 
- You're not onto drugs, are you? - No. 
- Mm... You just had a rough night. - Yeah, you could say that. 
Come on up the house. 
Some of my son's old clothes will probably fit you. 
Here, cover it up with that. 
I don't want you to give an old lady a heart attack. 
You're right in there? 
Yeah, everything's fine. 
- Supper's on the table. - I... 
Yeah, be there in a minute. 
I swear I'm gonna pay for it. 
Set it down over there. 
Come and sit down, son. 
I can't thank you both enough... for everything. 
It wouldn't have been decent to leave you out there to freeze. 
- Decent. 
- What? 
Um... nothing, I'm just not really used to that word. 
- That's a nice chopper you've got out there. 
- You know motorcycle? 
Oh Lord, here we go. 
My favorite is a 48 Panhead. 
All one new of the line. 
I think you're a little young for that, son. 
You must be exhausted. 
You get a good night sleep. 
In the barn. 
Nothing you can break out there. 
I love you. 
- Why is the Moon so lonely? 
- Why? 
Cause she used to have a lover. 
He can never touch her again. 
You sleep okay? Uh... yeah. 
You look like a man fixing to do a bad thing. 
You know, I have * * * * looking for blood. 
- What? 
- They find it. 
- We all got a choice, son. 
- Yeah, mine got taken. 
Bullshit. 
This was my son's jacket. 
Try it on. 
- Thank you. 
- Yeap... 
You take the bike for a spin, test the suspension 
64 uh... 
- Man, you heavy. 
- Yeah, I put on a little weight recently. 
Good morning! Good morning! 
Oh. It fits you beautifully. 
I brought you some... 
Gun X is in the barn. 
He just murdered two civilians. 
* * * two baits. Let's see if he can survive that. 
Fire at will! 
Come and get me! 
Hold his head up. 
Damn! 
Alpha one, do not lose him! 
Alfa two, target is coming to you! 
Pull up! PULL UP! 
Zero! 
Zero, is Logan dead? 
Zero, answer! 
Did you get him? Don't know, I'm down. 
Zero, come in! 
You tried to kill me. 
Logan? 
Where is Victor? 
Come back to base. 
I'll explain everything, we'll take Victor down together. 
Wrong answer. 
After I kill Victor, I'm coming for you. 
Logan, listen to me. 
If you go down this road, you're not gonna like what you found. 
You wanted the animal, Colonel? 
You got it. 
Those were good people back there. 
Innocent people. 
It's funny how good innocent people tend to die around here. 
Zero never stood a chance. 
The only thing that'll take him down is an Adamantium bullet 
This facility is compromised. 
Prep transport. 
Colonel, this is turning into a disaster. 
- Don't worry, we'll stop him. 
- Really? 
You've just spent half a billion dollars making him indestructible. 
- Sir? - Yes. 
The young mutant you've been looking for? 
We found him. 
General, Logan is the only piece of this puzzle. 
We need to evacuate this facility. Please, go back to Washington. 
We've got work to do. 
Yo hablo I talk. 
Tu hablas you talk. El habla? 
Somebody translate? 
Summers? 
Sit up and take off those glasses. 
I have a headache. 
Then you can wear them in detention, after school when you add up this conjugaison 100 times. 
Somebody else? 
He talks. 
Thank you. 
He talks, el habla. 
- You sure it was Victor? 
- Yeah. 
Damn! 
I'm sorry, man. 
What the hell happened to him after I left? 
He got worse. 
He felt like you abandoned him. 
Yeah, we all did. 
But Victor, he had to prove he was better than you. 
Hunting and killing everything he was appointed. 
Quite a few months later myself, couldn't take running them up. 
- Running who up? 
- Leave it alone. 
Running who up, John? 
Hey! Goddamn it, John! 
We hunted our own kind, Logan. 
There's a special place in hell for the things we did. 
Mutants? 
Why? 
Stryker say it would be making a difference, protecting people from the bad ones. 
How you gonna take Victor down, Logan? 
- Remember that stuff in Africa? 
- Yeah I remember Africa, what about it? 
Damn! 
What they do to you? 
Don't ask. 
Listen, Zero said something about an island. 
Does that mean anything to you? 
Nope. 
But merely Dukes knows. 
- Him and Zero were tied. 
- Fred Dukes? 
- Where is he? 
- He's here. 
- Well, let's go talk to him. 
- Hold on. 
He don't get until round four. 
But I gotta warn you, he developed a bit of eating disorder. 
We all got coping mechanisms. 
Trying to work him back into shape. 
Come on, Fred, if you want to get in shape, you gotta move man. 
Fred Dukes? 
That's * * * the creature that ate Fred. 
If you wanna * * * *, don't mention his weight. 
Hey, Fat. Fred. Um. 
So you remember that girl when she was 85 pounds, uh? 
- Oh that's funny. You're still so funny, Logan. 
- You know where Victor is? 
No idea. 
What's the island, * * *? 
Don't let the door hit you on the way out, Logan. 
This is lame, even to you. Tell me where Victor is. Come on Bob, for old times' sake, uh? 
Did you just call me... Blob? 
No, but- - 
Told you not to mention his weight. 
Why did you call him Blob? 
I didn't call him Blob, I said Bob! 
Goddamn it! 
I got an idea. 
- This is your idea of an idea? 
- Trying to help you out, Logan. 
Dukes don't like you that much, and you know it. 
The feeling is mutual. 
Use them gloves, man. Dance with them a little bit. 
Allow them to hang and ride on you. 
Figure if you do have a fight, he would tell you a thing he would've known. 
Come on Bill, look at him. 
A big old ass coming out the front of the shirt. 
Jesus, he's eaten a corn for chrissake. 
Is there even a stretch big enough to take this guy out of here? 
It ain't him I'm worried about getting out of here on a stretch. 
Wraith, you're an asshole. 
Whoop his ass! 
One? 
Oooh. What's that supposed to be? 
Want to dance me? 
Oh, that's good. Good. 
Hey! 
Guess what? 
See you can talk now. We got him right where we wanted. 
Whose side are you on anyway? 
Now, where is Victor? 
Little dark for sunglasses, don't you think? 
Please don't! Please don't! Please! 
Victor! 
Where's Victor? 
Victor's with Stryker on the island, they run it together. 
What? 
Victor'd be with Stryker? 
Yeah. 
You didn't know that? 
All that's left now is Logan, right? 
I trust you can handle that. 
I did before, didn't I? 
Oh yes. You did that. 
Our deal. It still applies, right? 
Of course. 
Now pack him and tag him, Captain. 
What's the island? 
It's where Stryker takes them after Victor's caught them. 
Wait a moment. 
Takes whom? 
Mutants. 
Rumour is that ( has it? ) Stryker's doing experiments on them. 
Mean you never wondered what happened to them? 
I tried not to. 
They killed her so I'd let them put Adamantium in me. 
They killed her for a goddamn experiment. 
Where is it? 
Logan. Stryker kept it real secret. 
But... 
- A prisoner escaped there once. 
- Who? 
His name is Remy LeBeau. 
He was a street hustler from New Orleans. 
The guards at the prison called him Gambit because he kept taking all their money at poker. That's all I know. 
What's Stryker up to, Fred? What's the end game? 
He's taking their powers, trying to combine them somehow. 
It's all I know, Logan. It's all I know. 
If I have to come back here I'm gonna take your head off. 
Coming with you, Logan. 
- There's no redemption where I'm going. 
- I ain't asking. 
There's our dude. 
That's cool. 
- I'm gonna cover the back, case he runs. 
- I'm not a-fighting with him. 
- Yeah you ain't. 
- What? 
I gotta fight with everybody? 
Don't dogs kill cats? 
Just go cover the back, will you? 
Are you Remy LeBeau? 
Do I owe you money? 
No. 
Then Remy LeBeau I am. 
Large blind's a hundred, small blind's fifty. 
May I give you a hand? 
What can I get for 17 bucks? 
17 dollars? 
A cab right home, perhaps. 
You're my brother's new babysitter, John? 
I ain't Bradley, Victor. 
And creepy black clothes don't scare me. 
Really? 
Worked on Dukes. 
That a shame, cause now I kill you. 
Logan wouldn't miss the chance. 
So what brings you to our fair city, sir? 
Victor Creed. 
And who's that? 
The man we're gonna kill. 
He works for a man named Stryker, on an island. 
- Just need to know where it is. 
- What makes you think I know that? 
Because I know who you are, Gambit. 
You are the guy who's escaped and you're the guy's who's gonna take me back there. 
You know, John... 
There's some I wanted to tell you. 
You're predictable. 
I can feel your spine Johnny boy. 
That's fun. Never knew you had one. 
It was a mighty nice take you have around the eyes, sir. 
They might took me more days to lock on. 
Hey, LeBeau, you listen to me... 
Two years I rotted in that hole, and I never go back. 
Ooh. Shiny. 
Tell me something, Jimmy. 
You even know how to kill me? 
I'm gonna cut your goddamn head off. 
See if that works. 
You're being slow, old man. 
Son of a bitch. 
You're gonna die for what you did to her. 
Victor! 
That's a nice stick. 
Shithead, here's the deal. 
So you're gonna take me to this island where I can kill 
Creed, Stryker and pretty much everyone you hate in this world. 
You understand? 
You really want to kill him? 
As long as you stand out of my way, yeah. 
Colonel. 
General? 
Is this weapon XI? 
All of their strengths, none of their weaknesses. 
You really hate them, don't you? 
No. I don't hate them. 
After 20 years of work with them, I was the one to see what they can do. 
If you win this war before it starts, you will save countless lives in the process. 
Preventive action is the only action here, General. 
The days of our country sitting on the sidelines are over. 
We need to take the fight to the enemy before they take the fight to us. 
- I admire your passion, I do. 
- Thank you. 
But this is how far as it goes. 
Weapon X was a.. a hickup! 
We know about your son, Bill. 
We know he is a mutant. 
And we know he killed your wife, you shouldn't have kept that from us. 
That... 
- That has nothing to do with my work. 
- Bullshit! 
You're too close to this. 
I'm sure you know. 
You're right. 
I won't lie to you. 
My son did bring the problem home for me. 
But I took an oath, to protect the american people of every threat both foreign 
or domestic. 
- You don't like flying, huh? 
- I'm fine. 
- Just concentrate on what you do. - You're sure? 
You got a bead of sweat on your brow there. 
- Very funny. Just keep your eyes on the... 
- On the what? 
The clouds? 
It's like a fucking yo-yo in here. 
Where did you get this anyway? 
Oh this is my baby. 
I won her to a game. 
- A jacks set with fives. 
- Great. 
Relax. We're almost there. 
There it is. 
The island. 
Three-mile island. Hiding in plain sight. 
Noone's been * * * for hiding inside a nuclear reactor. 
They think it's gonna turn them into freaks. 
Like you? 
Right... 
All right, you ready? 
Cos it's now or never. 
Let's go. 
I'm tell him. 
Hey! If it makes you feel any better, this's gonna hurt. 
Oh yeah. It kinda does actually. 
Good luck. 
Likewise. 
Oh shit! 
How are you doing? 
Everything all right? 
- * * * *? 
- A few hours. 
He will respond to my commands? 
Yes, Colonel. 
Logan. 
Welcome back to the war. 
Before I cut you, I wanna know why. 
I needed your powers for the Pool. 
The what? 
The mutant killer. Deadpool. 
Years of researching, and finding the right powers that can coexist within one body without ripping it apart. 
My son was the first piece of the puzzle. 
Logan, you are the last. 
You made weapon XI possible. 
I asked you to help, but since you wanted a quiet life... 
Well I've learned that nothing motivates the man in your family like... revenge. 
Who are you? 
She's a real old friend. 
You really think we just let you walk away. 
A dangerous man. 
I like to keep an eye on dangerous men. 
Tell him about the day you died. 
They gave a shot of hydrochloride thiazide. 
It reduces the heart rate so low, it appears even flat line. 
Don't be angry with her. 
It's a real credit to your species. 
Did you know that her sister has diamond-hard skin? 
Kayla's mutation is tacto-hypnosis. 
She can influence people as long as she touches them. 
Quite a useful tool in a seduction. 
It was never real my friend. 
It was real for me. 
Told you if you came down this road you wouldn't like what you found. 
That story you told me, about a man who ditched flowers for the moon... 
I had it backwards. 
I thought you are the moon, and I was Kuekuatsheu. 
But you were the trickster, aren't you? 
I am just the fool on that play. 
The worst part of it is : I should have known. 
I ignored my instincts. 
I ignored what I really am. 
Then that will never happen again. 
- Colonel. 
- Not now, Kayla. 
I have done everything you asked. 
My sister... 
You said if I'd help you, you'd let her go. 
Kayla it's not as simple as that. 
A mutation's unique. 
Quite beautiful. 
We just need a little more time to analyze it, that's all. 
You let him go? 
- Victor, please. 
- You can't let him go. 
- You can't beat him, Victor. 
- Give me the Adamantium! 
- Tests came... 
- We had a deal! 
You would never survive the operation! 
- I can take anything he can. 
- No you can't. 
You're my favorite soldier, Victor. 
Be patient, your time will come. 
He's using us. 
How about this time, you die for real? 
Let me go. 
Your * * * don't work on me. 
Victor! 
Feels good, doesn't it? 
All that rage. 
Do it. 
Logan! 
You're not an animal. 
Oh yes you are. 
Do it. 
Finish it. 
Logan? 
My sister. 
They have my sister. 
Please. I didn't trick you into loving me. 
It was real for me too. 
Please, I'm so sorry. 
They have my sister. 
Where is she? 
- Activate weapon XI. 
- The bounding process isn't complete. 
Just do it! 
Now! 
You okay? 
Come on. 
Okay. 
Perfect. 
- Kayla, get these kids outta here. 
- Logan? 
Find another way out. 
Come on. Let's go! 
Wade, is that you? 
Guess Stryker found he finally figured out a way to shut you up. 
Wade... 
You don't have to do that. 
Or maybe you do. 
Shoot on sight! 
I can help. 
Take me at it. 
Go! 
Go! Now! 
Think I get' em? 
Yeah. 
- Let's go. 
- I can't go. 
Kayla, come on! 
I have to stay here. 
You take them. 
Go! 
Left. 
- What? 
- We go left. 
- You can't see. 
- Trust me. 
Climb on up. Let's see how you dance up here. 
Nobody kills you but me. 
Back-to-back! 
- I see. 
- No. 
Stop! 
- This can't be the way. 
- This is the way. 
- How do you know? 
- I just know. 
Come on. 
Adamantium bullets. 
Let's see him heal with a few of these through his thick skull. 
You cannot stop him. 
Even with that. 
He'll heal. 
His brain may heal. 
But his memories won't grow back. 
This does not change anything between us, Victor. 
We're done. 
We can never be done, Jimmy. 
We're brothers. 
Brothers look out for each other. 
- You miss me? 
- Oh Jesus... 
When you said you were gonna kill everyone, I thought you mean really exaggerating. 
Here... 
Do I look like a man who exaggerates? 
You're welcome. 
These kids try to get off the island. 
- Split up. Go! 
- I'm on it. 
I love you. 
No... 
I am so cold. 
Listen to me, I'm gonna get you outta here. 
You understand? 
Slow and easy. Nice and easy. 
I'm gonna keep you up. 
I should make you pull the trigger. 
But that would make us no better than you. 
Drop the gun on me. 
Walk until your feet bleed. And then keep walking. 
It will be all right, Scott. 
My name is Charles Xavier. 
I am a mutant like you. 
- I can hear your thoughts. 
- Yes. 
And I can hear yours. 
You are safe now. 
Come. 
We have to go. 
The kids are safe. 
- Who are you? 
- What do you mean who am I? 
I'm the guy who brought you here. 
Now we gotta go. 
Where the hell am I? 
Listen, I am a friend. 
A friend. 
What's my name? 
What's my name? 
Your name is Logan. 
You need to trust me. 
We have to go. 
Follow me. 
Now! 
Do you know her? 
No. 
Bet these boys aren't gonna like what you did in this place. 
We really need to go. 
I'll find my own way. 
Good luck. 
Colonel Stryker? 
- Colonel William Stryker? 
- Yes. 
You're wanted for questioning in connection of the death of Gen. Munson. Sir. 
In my line of work there are two cardinal rules. 
Tell the truth, and never, ever become emotionally involved with your subject. 
The trouble is, you see, all truths are in fact half true, like when you read the newspaper. 
It's never just the facts. 
There's always judgment. 
It goes all the way back to when Jesus died. 
No one really knew what to think of him, not until someone put it on paper and said, 
" Here, here's the gospel truth." 
Legends aren't born, they're written. 
And really, that's what we all do one way or another, when someone we love dies, 
and not just anyone, when it's someone extraordinary, your own personal Jesus. 
Why not? 
A hero. 
When they up and die, we're left with nothing. 
Nothing but the task. Make them immortal. 
Only a magnificent epitaph will grant eternal life, and it's up to us, the ones left behind, to write it however we see fit. 
Rockets away, my boys. 
This is 1986, a few days before the whole Challenger Space Shuttle mishap. 
... for soon-to-be teacher in space, Christa McAuliffe. 
This is her hometown. Proud, overjoyed. 
For a few more days, at any rate. 
And in the same town, this very same week, another teacher died. 
Their teacher. 
They were the unteachable, 
the outcasts, the freaks, the future fuckups of America, but their teacher loved them and they loved him back. 
Well, most of them did. 
Before their story collided with mine, there was another hero who left this world, my world, New York City, three weeks earlier. 
I was a newspaper reporter, and like most, I was a cynic, but I secretly yearned to be proved wrong. 
- Hey, Babbitt, nice article. 
- Thank you. 
To believe in something, someone. 
And once you're a believer, well, what's to say? 
It's very potent stuff. 
Perfect. 
She was witness to a murder, so I couldn't use her real name. 
I called her Angela, because Angela saw the face of the boy who killed her son. 
She saw his shock and pain. 
" The fullness of his action coming down on his adolescent face, 
" still just a child himself." 
I painted her as a hero, and she was. 
I just don't know what she thought about me saying so. 
My baby. 
I never got the chance to ask. 
No, no, no! 
I didn't really lie. 
All right, fuck it. I lied. 
I kept her alive doing the things I thought she should have done. 
I went a bit overboard, perhaps, but this is what we do. 
You want them to live on, turn the life into a legend. 
Your latest, it's a little baroque. I'm going to tone it down. 
Don't fucking touch it. 
It's gotta stop, and that's that. 
You're obsessing, and frankly, you smell. 
But in the workplace, personal crusades tend to make others... 
Stop that. 
... uncomfortable. 
I'm sending you to New Hampshire. 
Local hero, your favorite. 
Teacher in space, hometown hoopla, blah, blah, blah. 
You're going to break that. 
I hope you fucking die up there. 
Shit. Shit! 
Don't get on this bus. 
Hi, it's Sam. 
Leave a message. 
Hello, Sam Callalucci. 
If you recognize my voice, you're a greater friend to me than I ever was to you. 
It's Campbell Babbitt. 
It must be 15 years at least since we... 
Well, since you graduated. 
I heard you were going to become a priest. 
That's... 
I mean, no, I'm sure you had your reasons. 
The reason I'm calling... 
Well, I think I'm standing outside your apartment building. 
I was wondering if you could do me a favor. 
I need to borrow a car. 
I don't seem to be able to find a rental, and it would be really helpful if you could 
find some way of furnishing me with a set of wheels. 
It'll be good to see you and catch up, find out what went wrong. 
So call me. Okay. 
Hold that bus. 
Jerk. 
And after being chosen from over 11,000 teachers, 
Christa McAuliffe and her students here were deeply honored. 
She will teach her lesson from spaces... 
Space, using two of the actual mice sent up in the last Challenger mission. 
- And finally... 
- Fuck this. 
A sad bit of local news. 
Last night, one of our teachers, Sam Callalucci, died under what can only be described as unfortunate circumstances. 
Yes, it's the Red Gremlin. 
Well, how bad is it? 
Could I make it to New York? 
Well, right, what, 50-50? 
40-70? 
That doesn't add up. 
Okay. 
It doesn't matter. 
Right, 40-70. 
I'll come and pick it up. 
I'll catch the bus. 
- Fuck. - Fuck. 
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! 
- Hey! - Hey, Lute, I want to talk to you. 
You found him? 
What were you doing there? 
Was he alive? 
Hey. Did he say anything about me? 
What do you want from me? 
I didn't kill him. 
I'm sorry. 
I know. I'm so sorry. 
I'll get the next one. 
What are you doing? 
Oh, hello. 
I'm a reporter. 
What building is this? 
It's the Shed. 
It's our classroom. 
Right. 
Is that like a special ed or something? 
Who's Special Ed? 
So, you know him? 
- Who? 
- Mr. C. 
- No, I was just... 
- Mr. Callalucci. 
Sam Callalucci? 
Yes. 
We went to university together. 
- I knew it. 
You could be his brother. 
- You sound like James Bond. 
I'm British, so... 
- I was thinking of popping in. 
- To the funeral. 
It's called a wake. 
A funeral is when you bury him. 
Are we going to bury him? 
No, we're just going to go sit next to his body for a while. 
- Wait, wait. 
- It's called a wake, because he was Catholic. 
He was almost a priest. 
- Almost. 
I just loved him. 
Some of us wanted to say a few words about Mr. Callalucci. 
Before he was our teacher, Mr. C was almost a priest. 
- Almost. 
- Almost. 
That's how come he knew all about what it is to have faith. 
Now it's up to us to have a little faith in him. 
It's so hard to believe that he's no longer here. 
He is, you know. 
This sort of thing happens all the time. 
People feel that dead person all around them. 
But everybody's like," No, you gotta fucking accept it. 
" Gotta learn to move on without him." 
And if you listen to them, well, then, pretty soon that person really is dead. 
He did things. 
Good things, mostly. 
And actions cause reactions. 
So what we do right now is different because of what he did then. 
Because whatever he did, we're not the same because of it, and that's never gonna change thanks to him. 
- Excuse me. Aren't you a reporter? - Yes. 
You aren't reporting about this, are you? No. 
Sam and I were at college together. 
No. Sam wasn't English. 
Yes, I know. 
Thank you. No, I was at college in the US with Sam. 
I was kicked out of Cambridge. It's a long story. 
I was covering the Christa McAuliffe shuttle thing, and I thought I'd stop by. 
I'm sorry. 
Penelope Little. 
Please forgive me. 
You understand I didn't want the press getting involved in all of this. 
I'm assuming you knew the circumstances. 
Did Sam... 
I mean, I notice that it's not exactly overflowing with well-wishers. 
Kill the lights. 
He hated bad lighting. 
- Hey, Peg. 
- What... 
Oh, my God, you guys. 
I live in the rooming house where you're staying. 
If you see me there, please don't ask me to say anything. 
I'm sure others will be more than eager to talk and talk, but if you're really his friend, please don't ask them. 
It was nice to meet you. 
I like your shoes. 
- Hey, Donna, it's me. 
- You guys are fucking nuts. 
I think I might actually have something here. 
I can't. 
Everyone put something in? 
Tess? 
Can we help you? 
Sorry. Sorry, I didn't mean to intrude. 
It's Mr. C's best friend. 
- Sorry, I didn't mean to barge in. 
- What's your name? - Campbell Babbitt. 
- What's your last name? 
- Babbitt. 
- Where are you from? 
- He's from Ireland. 
- England. 
I'm English. 
You must miss him so much. 
Of course he does, you dink. 
Do you want to talk about it? 
I mean, like, you know, your feelings, the hurt, the loss... 
I mean, we knew him well, but not, you know, best friends. 
Well, I don't know. 
I mean, you know, maybe you guys were his best friends. 
Did he say that to you? 
Did he? 
- Mr. B? Are you a teacher, like Mr. C? 
- Yeah? 
No. Why? 
You think you're gonna get him to take his place? 
Forget it. The Shed is dead. 
We all get new homerooms tomorrow. 
They're reassigning us. 
What? 
Someone ought to say it. 
Excuse me, Tess. 
You don't know. 
She doesn't know. 
And when you don't know, don't open your mouth, because the rest of us have ears 
- that get filled with your bullshit. - Okay, come on. Come, come. 
- Freak. - So you came to visit him? 
Well, I was assigned to cover the teacher in space. 
- Wait. So you're a reporter? 
- But I thought he was a teacher. 
No, I'm with... I say, I am a reporter. 
That's why I'm here. 
- I want to talk to you guys. - I thought he was a teacher. 
- Guys, come here. 
What do you want? 
I thought perhaps I could help out some way. 
Help how? 
You know, tell his story, tell the world about him and you all. 
What are you talking about? 
I spoke to my editor, and she thinks it could be a very big story, so... 
You don't know us and we don't know you. 
And you think you're just going to waltz in here and do some big spread? 
- It could be his legacy. 
- We are his legacy. 
- Mr. Babbitt. - Yes. 
You have to understand that none of us trusted anything. 
Mr. C, he made us give a piece of ourselves, 
I mean, something that touches your soul so, so deep that you're never, ever the same. 
And after that, we trusted each other. 
Yeah. We trusted. 
Right. 
Couldn't we just cut our thumbs and rub them together? 
This is weird. 
It's very... It's very... 
This is very difficult for me. 
Obviously, I want you to trust me. 
- Then tell us. - Please. 
He's got nothing to say. 
I knew a single mother who lost her only child. 
He was shot, a random killing. 
He was holding her hand at the time. 
And the thing about Angela was, even in mourning, people felt better being near her, stronger. 
I thought if I wrote about her, I could recognize that strength. 
She didn't know what she was. 
A lot of people don't know what they are. 
Good people. 
The point of the story is that people were moved by the words I wrote and they were inspired by her. 
And what, she lived happily ever after? 
No. 
She died. 
She died, right? 
And you loved her. Well, no. 
A journalist isn't supposed to fall in love with his subject, so... 
But you did. 
What did he say? 
- Who? 
What? 
- Mr. C, when you told him about it. 
He said," Keep telling stories 
" and through the stories we will find redemption." 
- Thanks for giving me a ride. 
- That's why I have a passenger seat. 
So, what's your thing, Tess? 
What's your field? 
- Art. 
- Art. 
Cool. 
So you knew him really well? Sam? 
Yeah. 
Did he ever mention me? 
Yeah. He spoke very highly of you. 
- He said your work was very strong. 
- Strong? He said that? 
I guess he probably mentioned that big arts-and-crafts fair we had last year, right? 
Are you kidding? 
He was so proud of the way you guys put the whole thing together. 
He talked about the crafts and the arts... 
God, fuck. 
- Did you even know him? 
- What? 
There is no arts-and-crafts fair. 
- Okay. - I think I'm gonna be sick. 
- Okay. - What else did you lie about? 
Hey. 
Hey. It was a long time ago, okay? 
I did go to college with him. 
- You said best friends. 
- I know. That was those twins. 
They said it. - They're not twins. - Well, whatever they are. 
The girls with the... 
The twinsey-type girls said that and I didn't feel it was my place to correct... 
Oh, so you just lied. 
Look, it seemed like they needed to hear that, you know, that he really loved you guys. 
And I may not have been around to hear it firsthand, but I knew Sam and, you know, I... 
He was a dedicated man, and I'm sure whatever I said was entirely true. 
I'm going to tell you something, all right? 
He didn't fall off that roof. He jumped. 
He wasn't a hero or a martyr. 
He just... 
He gave a little too much love, and he couldn't take it back. 
To whom? 
To you? 
Why don't you ask Lucy? 
Lucy knows why he's dead. 
Second house on the right. 
- Is that your... 
Your dad's waiting for you... 
- That's not my dad. 
Tess? 
It's Uncle Rick. 
It's okay. Your dad's asleep. 
Come on, honey. 
Open up. 
18, 17, 16... You remember? 
I remember. 
So take teenagers as this subpopulation, these desperate thrill-seeking beasts. 
Sexuality practically oozes out of them. 
They're potent. 
Then take the rejects, the disturbed, the misunderstood, the unteachable, and you set them apart, isolate them from their peer group. 
- Are you with me? 
- Isolated, potent rejects. 
Gotcha. 
Okay. Then along comes a teacher, an almost-priest, who says, 
" In my classroom you are free from those repressive societal constraints." 
He says," You can do whatever you like without fear of being judged," 
and they accept. 
And maybe the teacher feels like a god for doing this, or maybe he feels like he's gone too far and he can't find his way back. 
Maybe this almost-priest thinks he's Jesus, and who can blame him with such loyal and lusty disciples? 
- Where's the Christa connection? 
- Well, that's it, isn't it? 
It's the murky side of heroism. 
It's the anti-Christa. 
These kids have been touched, they're unshackled. 
It's not really a newspaper article. It's more like a novel. 
And that doesn't help you, but you're getting the condensed version. 
And what about Angela, the articles? 
Are we done with that now? 
- lf that's your decision. 
- She's just one woman, you know. 
I mean, it must've been pretty exhausting reading about herself every night. 
- I'm not fighting you. 
- Fine. But I want to see a draft on the Christa article by tomorrow. 
Okay, but that is the Christa article. 
No, it's not. 
Tomorrow. 
And then you can dance with the devil all you want. 
Mr. Babbitt? 
- Mr. Babbitt, I hope I'm not disturbing you. 
- No, no. Because I was feeling very guilty about how rude I was to you this afternoon. 
- Don't mention it. 
- Oh, you're very kind. 
I have something for you. 
His family, they're in California. 
They asked me to give away his clothing. 
- Oh, no, no. I couldn't possibly. 
- Don't be silly. That jacket you were wearing sure won't be able to tackle a New Hampshire winter. 
Why don't you try it on? 
Try it on. If it doesn't fit, I will have to give it to someone else. 
- Okay. Sure. - Put it on. 
Let's see. Turn around. 
You're just his size. 
Warm. 
Those kids, they just... 
I lose my dignity when I'm around them. 
They know all my secrets. 
Well, you know that Sam demanded his students be completely honest with him. 
It went both ways. 
- I don't think Sam would... 
- I know he did. He told me he did. 
To earn their trust, he had to be completely honest with them. 
You knew that Sam and I were engaged, didn't you? - No. 
I mean, no... I don't think he... 
- Really? 
He never told you? 
Yes, he mentioned it. I remember. 
Well, a mention. 
This is a nice room. 
I used to have this room. 
Sam used to visit me here. I'm sorry. 
It's just so hard to take in sometimes. 
- It's all right. - Thank you. 
It's okay. 
Thank you. 
I need a hug. 
Oh, God. You've been very kind. 
Hey, Campbell Babbitt! 
Hey. 
What's happening? 
- Jim stole the coffin. 
- Mr. C's coffin, with Mr. C in it. 
We left one in there. 
It was from the showroom. We even put a stop sign in it. 
- For weight. - Yeah. 
So, where's the coffin? 
- Did Jim do this by himself? 
We helped. So you all stole the coffin? 
Must've been tricky. 
It's got handles. 
- Nice coat. 
- Thank you. 
Well? 
- Well done. 
- Yeah? 
Yeah, sure. 
- Isn't he going to rot or something? 
- It's on ice. 
- Oh, my gosh. That's right. 
- Well, that's a fucking load off. 
- Do you have a... 
- No, I'm good. 
Did you ever used to smoke grass with Sam? 
Well, I think Lucy did one time, right, Jim? 
Yo, man, you got a light? 
He was irreplaceable, you know? 
There's no one like him anywhere. 
No one could take his place. 
No one's trying to, Jim. 
As much as we might want it. 
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night 
Bring me my Romeo : and, when he shall die 
Cut him out in little stars And he will make the face of heaven so fine 
That all the world will be in love with night. 
Juliet. 
Mr. C was her director. 
Satellite. 
Hey, man. Want some? 
The sensei? 
Well, if you insist. I would love to. 
- Great. - Great. 
- What are you looking for, Ezra? 
- I don't know. 
I can't believe that McAuliffe chick gets to go up into all that. 
- Maybe she'll bump into Sam. 
- Maybe. 
I once said his name three times and it started to rain. I swear to God. 
Oh, can you put that in your story? 
Of course, I can. 
- We saw his face. - In a cloud. 
- He was smiling. 
- Perfect. 
- Do you think he might do it? 
- Take over for Mr. C? 
You look ridiculous. 
Hey, Lucy! 
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, one 
Attention all students. 
Due to cold water... 
Weather in Florida, the Challenger shuttle launch has been postponed, so consequently we won't be having a celebration assembly. 
However, I have it from very good sources that tomorrow will be the day. 
Please all stand. 
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands. 
One Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
On the Challenger... - I can't hear you! 
Very nice, Lute. 
- I fixed the spelling. 
I see. I see. 
Hey, Lute, can you come and sit down? 
I have to ask you a very, very serious question. 
This Mr. Babbitt, the reporter, I can't tell what he's up to. 
Turn. 
Has he been talking to any of the students, asking them questions? 
No. Lute, if you were to be my assistant choir mistress... 
Miss Little, I really don't know anything about it. 
Lute, when do you go in front of the judge? 
Is that tomorrow? 
This afternoon. 
Well, I wrote you a very glowing affidavit. Turn. 
Very glowing, despite what I told you I think of shoplifters. 
It was only a pair of jeans, and just that one time. I know. 
That's why I wrote it. But it's a... 
Turn... 
legal document that I signed, swearing to God that you're... 
Oh, that's your cue. Go. Go, go, go, go, go. 
" Sam Callalucci, Ethics Committee. 
" On receipt of this letter, you are informed of immediate suspension. 
"... inappropriate relationship with a student." 
Lucy and Mr. C were in love. 
How could that be inappropriate? 
Who would tell on them? 
Who would do something like that? 
- Some jealous dimwit. 
- Yes, yes, jealous, definitely. 
... on the beat! 
- Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. 
Listen to the beat. 
May I help you? 
Yeah, if I wanted to find a newspaper article, how would I do that? 
Do you know the periodical? 
Do you know the author? 
Yeah, I know the author. 
Doesn't say she died. 
Hi, Gina. 
I need to speak to Donna. 
It's Campbell Babbitt. 
Hold on, Babbitt. Donna will talk to you. 
- Hi. A bunch of us are getting together tonight at Peggy's, you know, the girl in the wheelchair. 
Her parents are out of town. 
She's got a heated pool and a hot tub. 
Get out of the cold and wet. 
You should come, you know, for the article. 
- Of course. 
- 842 Hemlock Drive. 
- You going to remember that? Yeah. 
How are you going to do that if you don't write it down? 
Half of eight is four, half of four is two and Socrates killed himself by drinking hemlock, so... 
- The Greek guy? 
- Indeed. 
-" Indeed." 
- No, I'm still here. 
I'm waiting. 
Why did he kill himself? 
Well, he was arrested and he thought the charges against him were a joke, so he did it as a kind of protest. 
- I bet you know why he was arrested, too. 
- Maybe. 
Two charges. 
Disrespecting the gods. 
They didn't like independent thinkers then anymore than they do now. 
The second reason? 
- Corrupting the young. - Indeed. 
Are you trying to educate me, Mr. Babbitt? 
Just in case your memory isn't what it used to be. 
842 Hemlock. 
- See you tonight. - Okay. 
Campbell? 
Campbell, are you there? 
Gina, I don't hear him. 
Campbell? 
- Oh, hi, Donna. 
Yes, listen... - Shut up and sit down. 
Are you sitting? 
- Yeah, sure. 
- We just got advance word. 
You, my dear, are on the shortlist for... 
Are you ready? 
- What? 
- The Pulitzer Prize. 
- The goddamn fucking Pulitzer Prize. 
- What for? 
What for? 
Angela. What else, you nitwit? 
- Um. - He said" um." 
Listen. Call me tonight, all right? 
You still have my home phone? No. 
Give it to me again. 
World newsroom. 
I need you down here first thing in the morning. 
We're going to hook you and Angela up to an interview with one of the affiliates. 
- No. We can't do that. 
- We can't? 
Angela wouldn't go for it. 
What happened? Did the two of you have a spat or something? 
- No. Fuck off. 
- I was bad. Yeah. 
Damn right. 
Listen, why don't you give me her number and I'll call her? 
Campbell, do you want to win this thing or not? 
- No. - No. God, no. 
Angela's not dead. 
I'm sorry. I don't know where you would have heard that. 
I see. Okay. 
Thank you. 
Oh, my God. 
- Hi. 
You must be Peggy. - Oh, lucky guess. 
You must be the reporter everyone wants to fuck. 
Hey. 
- Hello. 
- Hey, watch the trousers. 
- I didn't notice that. Sorry. 
Hi. - Okay. 
- You found it. - Yeah. 
This was his copy. 
I think he would have wanted you to have it. 
- Where did you find this? 
- It was in his desk. 
- Those drawers were locked. 
- I happened upon some keys. 
- I like your style. 
- I can't stay. 
- Why not? 
- I've gotta go back to New York. 
But what about the article? 
They don't guarantee they're going to print everything, so I don't have any control over that. 
Won't you just sit down for a minute? 
- Are you nervous about something? 
- I'm just antsy. 
You know, I want to get going. The weather's terrible, so... 
Look at Peggy. 
You know what happened? 
She got hit by a Yum-Yum Chicken truck. 
Made a bundle off the lawsuit. 
They put her in the Shed because it's handicapped-accessible. 
That really pissed her off, so she snapped or something and I guess they decided she really did belong there. 
What made you belong there? 
Too many mistakes, I guess. 
- Don't worry about it, Fenster. 
- Okay. 
Hey, you know you've got a real sleek wheelchair, Peg. 
Some of them have got no style and stuff, but yours has got real lines, you know? 
My grandpa, he actually, like, invented stuff for handicapped people, like crutches and walkers, and... 
You told me he was a movie director. 
Yeah, he did that first. 
Hey, that must be you from... 
- Fenster, come on. 
- Yeah. Coming. 
They've all just forgotten him already. 
Of course, we have you now. 
The question is, what are you going to do with us? 
I really have to go. No, you can't. 
You haven't interviewed me. 
Do you need a hand with that at all? 
Keep talking, Fenster. 
Tell me about your grandmother or something. 
Okay, yeah. 
She was friends with everybody, you know, like, everybody in the neighborhood, like, presidents and famous guitar players and... 
She spoke Latin and she liked horses a lot. 
She actually had a couple of horses, and she could drive a blimp. 
Yeah, she was actually one of the first to ever do that. 
Fenster, 
I need you to do me a favor. 
- Like? 
- Like... 
- Why me? 
- Because no one will ever believe you. 
- I need you to... 
- Okay. Yeah. 
Sure, Peg. Okay. 
- You run like a girl. 
Where's the reporter? 
He'll be back. 
What does it feel like, Fenster? 
I need to know what it feels like. 
- I don't know. 
- You don't know? 
- Good. 
- What do... What do you mean, good? 
- You're pulling my... 
- Good? 
lbuprofen. 
You-buprofen. 
We-all-buprofen. 
Mother's little helper. 
Hi, Tess. 
I know you lied about that woman, Angela. 
Remember? 
She's dead. You really fucked me up with that story. 
You really got us all feeling so bad for you. 
But she's not dead, is she? 
- So what, you read my articles? - Yeah. 
I went to the library. 
I was reading about this woman and her poor son. 
It doesn't say she died. 
You just killed her off, I mean, to buy our sympathy. 
I mean, what kind of asshole lies? - I didn't kill her off. 
- Yeah, you did. 
- You lied about Angela. - I didn't... 
You lied about knowing Mr. C. I mean, what... 
I didn't lie. 
What's wrong? 
Nothing, I'm fine. 
Are you okay? 
You have some... You've still got some stuff. 
It's this stomach virus that I have. 
Maybe you should go home, unless that's where you caught the virus. 
What's that supposed to mean? 
Just, you know... Just what I said. 
Fuck you. 
Seriously, fuck you. 
Don't think you know me. 
You don't fucking know me. 
- Hey, hey. Just... 
- You don't know anything about me! Hey, listen, just because you have problems at home... 
Fuck you! - Don't take it out on me. 
- Why not you? Well, okay. 
You know what? You know what? 
You're right. You're right... 
You're right about everything. Angela's alive and well. 
I used her, I lied, and you win. 
I'm out of here. 
Have a nice life. 
Just stay away from Lucy. 
No, don't... You don't know anything about me, either, sweetheart. 
There's nothing wrong with... 
- It's none of your business. 
- Yeah, well, I'll make it my business. 
I swear I will. 
That's interesting, because someone made it their business to notify the school there was an inappropriate relationship between a student and Sam. 
You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you? 
It's all right. 
I won't tell your friends, even though they'd be very unhappy. 
Yeah, well... 
Well, I saw them together, Mr. C and Lucy, having sex in the Shed. 
What was I supposed to do? 
Look, you may have done the right thing, but just be careful where you point that finger. 
- I'm not Sam. 
- Yeah, well, you sure fooled Lucy. 
- Lucy is a very confused girl. 
I'm just... - What, a nice guy? - Yes. 
- Yeah, and I've got a stomach virus. 
Well, Reverend Father, we hear you, but we Americans believe with you that even the humblest... 
He's got really great hair. 
... to be free. 
My fellow citizens, Members of the House, let us not take the path of least resistance in Central America again. 
- Hey, Campbell. - Hi. 
Get us some beer? 
I... I... I have to go back to New York, yeah, so... 
It's been great meeting you guys, and I'll see you. 
Come on. We can take my car. 
No, what I really need now is a push. 
I don't push. 
Jim and Ezra are inside, but after that rude exit of yours... 
- You know, you made Sue cry. - Jesus. 
I'm just saying it'd be a lot better if you came back with some beer. 
Jim! Jim, wait up. 
We figured it out. 
We just wanted to let you know. 
- It had to be Miss Little who told on them. 
- We know who it was. 
- Who else? 
- Who else? 
- She was jealous. - Lucy and Mr. C were in love. 
But she's not going to get away with it. 
Do you want to hear our plan? - We have a plan. 
- It's really good. 
- Not really, no. 
- No? Maybe later. 
She's not coming back, James. 
Don't call me James. 
What? 
Do you think those keys you found would open Mr. C's apartment? 
- Don't you want to? 
- No. 
Maybe he meant for us to come here. 
You go first. 
No, no. No, I'll go first. 
Oh, my God. 
Did you find anything? No, no. 
I thought I might find this gold necklace that I gave him. It was a cross, but... 
I'm... I'm going to go on the roof and take a look. 
You want to come? 
No, you stay here. 
I'll be back later. 
Stupid. 
Yes? 
Oh, my God. You're never going to believe what just happened. 
This neighbor woman came in and thought that I was his niece, so I said," Thanks for the coffee cake. 
Really sweet of you." 
Just like I thought maybe his niece might say. Lucy. 
Lucy. 
Lucy. - I want to see. - No, no, no. 
No. 
Come... Come here. 
Let your passions overwhelm your fears. 
Is that what he said? 
He said it to me. 
Look, Lucy, you are a very, very, very beautiful young woman. 
But this would be... 
- A mistake? 
- Yes. Is it Angela? 
- No. 
- I understand. 
You're afraid to love again. Me, too. 
It hurts so much. 
Even when it's right, it hurts. 
But if we were afraid of it, it would be so sad. 
We would be just like everyone else. 
I can't... 
I... No, no, no. 
Let's not... Stop. Look... 
You're very young. I'm 17. 
It's not like it doesn't happen all the time. 
Yeah, well, you know, be that as it may, there are boundaries. 
We... Actions have consequences. 
We can't just flit around saying we're gonna keep the dead from dying. 
We can't, okay? 
I'm sorry if I led you on, but let's just come out and say it, right? 
Sam's dead. 
Angela's dead. 
I'm not Sam and you're not Angela. 
Okay, answer me this. Why did Sam jump? 
Perhaps he crossed a line with you that he couldn't come back from. 
That's not what happened. You can't... 
No, you don't know that. 
You know, it's not really love when... 
It's never a mistake. 
Lucy, let's not... Let's not do this. 
You don't think that he loved me. 
- I think he was confused... - Shut up. 
Just... 
Please. 
I went swimming once at this quarry, 
and everyone was jumping off this kind of cliff thing, and I got in line and jumped. 
It was high enough that I had time to think, to think, like," I'm still falling, I haven't landed yet." 
Do you think that he had time to think? 
I guess he did. 
You think he was thinking about me? 
No. 
No? 
I thought you understood. 
My God. 
God! 
Someone help! 
What do you want? 
- Oh, my God! Where did you find that? 
- It was on the roof. 
Throw it. 
I was wrong. 
He was thinking about you. 
I thought he was jumping, but he must've been going for the necklace. 
Campbell, maybe you were right. 
- Maybe we shouldn't... 
- Don't... Don't say that. 
You know, he was torn from your life. 
The ground opened up beneath you. 
What are you supposed to do, float? That's bollocks. 
You reach out and you flail, try and grab hold of something or someone. 
You know, you reached out for me, and I didn't take your hand, and I... 
You know, it's... You need it and I need it. 
And it doesn't matter how crazy that looks on the outside. 
I'm not outside, I'm... 
You know, metaphorically speaking. 
Obviously, you know, I'm... 
Actually... 
Where are you going? 
Campbell. 
Campbell, what the fuck are you doing? Hey. 
- My parents. 
- Just... Just to talk. 
We've said so much already. 
We don't have to talk. 
I just... Look, I just know that I needed to see you. 
That's all I knew. 
Campbell, no. 
Please. 
- Look, I'm sorry. 
- No, I know. 
- Look, I know that you would never... - I didn't mean to... I would never, you know... 
I'm not... 
I just thought that if... That maybe I could... 
If I could be whatever you wanted me to be... Oh, my God. 
Are you okay? 
- Yeah, I'm fine. 
- Be careful. 
Look, I'm sorry, okay? This is... 
I'm going to go. Yeah. 
Are you still going to New York? 
There's nothing there for me. 
I can't stay here. 
Hey, what about tomorrow? 
Tomorrow? 
Yeah, tomorrow, after school. 
Maybe we should talk. And we can meet at the lake. 
Well, I don't want you to feel... 
I want to. 
- You sure? 
- Aren't you? 
You do my thinking for me, okay? 
Okay. 
- Mr. Campbell, what are you doing? 
- I'm just going to my room. 
I rented your room this morning. 
You told me you were checking out. 
Fine. 
It's very late. 
I do have... 
And that woman, Donna, she keeps calling for you. 
Don't worry about her. 
Not for a grown man, but... 
No, no, it's great, really. 
He's in military school now. 
Well, they can be so... 
So restless at that age. 
Well, at any age. 
" You shall go to the ball." 
We have to seek before we can find, find out what God meant for us to be. 
Don't let them beat that out of your son. 
No, I won't, Mr. Campbell. 
Campbell is my first name. 
What's yours? 
- Barbara. 
- Barbara. 
Lovely. Thank you, Barbara. 
No, no, thank you, Mr... 
Campbell. 
- Night-night. 
- Good night. 
Fuck. 
Fuck. 
It's okay. It's okay. Okay. 
It's all right. Okay. 
He... 
He was choking. He was choking on Mars. 
Remote. Little. 
Remote. 
- Hello? - Fenster. 
- Hey. 
- You going to school today? 
- No. 
I don't like it there. - Right. 
Can I come over? 
Yeah. 
Yeah, definitely. 
- Okay. 
- Okay. - Bye. 
- Bye. 
I'm sure I'm speaking for all of us when I say that we were really looking forward to this morning's excitement. 
I spoke with my man at NASA, and she assures me and urges us all to keep our chins up. 
So, the celebration assembly will have to wait for another day. 
However, tonight's musical salute to Miss McAuliffe, 
Blast Off, produced by Miss Penelope Little, is good to go. 
Lucy, can I ask you a favor? 
Are you sure? 
Because I... I bought condoms. Yes. 
I can't get pregnant, okay? 
Ever. 
- That must make you kind of sad, huh? 
- Yeah, kind of. 
- Let's just do this. 
- Okay. 
The one that smells good. 
- Fenster, honey! 
- Fenster, honey! 
Fenster up there. 
Well, you know, it's kind of complicated with you. 
And what would you have me do? 
I don't know. Like, moan or... Or something? 
Get off. 
Get off. I want to get up. 
Fenster! 
God. 
No, no, no. 
Just a second! 
Fenster! Fenster, help me up. 
Just a second, Mom! 
Fenster. I'm stuck. 
Hi, Mrs. Itsky. 
You've been shopping? 
Mr. Campbell... 
Mr. Babbitt... 
You have a phone call. 
- Take a message. 
- She said it was urgent. 
Tell her I'm dead. 
Tell her I quit and I'm dead. 
Mr. Babbitt, I don't think that I would feel very comfortable telling... 
Fuck. 
- Do you think you could take the phone? 
Gina, get me the thing. 
No, the other thing. 
Babbitt. 
Hey, Fenster, have you seen Lucy? 
What are you doing now? 
Well, the whole sex thing is kind of weird, but I'm not really sure because I don't really have much to compare it to. 
Know what I mean? 
Wait a minute, that was your first time? 
Don't tell Peggy. 
Well, I doubt any experience is going to prepare you for sex with Peggy. 
Yeah. 
It's a whole different ball of wax. 
But, you know, if you stick enough lubricant in just about anything, you're good to go. 
Second entrance on the right. - Sure. 
- I used to use mayonnaise a lot. 
Mayonnaise is good, except it makes your thing smell like a sandwich. 
The thing is, with Peggy... 
The thing is, I think I love her. 
- What's her name? 
- That's Lute. 
What's she doing? 
Shit. 
Lute? 
Hey! Have you seen Lucy? 
- Lucy? 
- Yeah. No. 
What is that? What are you doing? 
My punishment. 
The judge said I do this, and it won't go on my record. 
What did you steal? 
Do you know Antonio Calvache? 
- What, jeans? 
- Everyone is wearing Calvache. 
Calvache, Calvache, Calvache. 
And I swore I'd never... 
Hi, Fenster. I'd never do it again. 
Well, you're done. - What? 
But... 
- You're done. 
- Okay. - Come on. Get in. 
My mom's picking me up. 
You'll probably find Lucy at the musical. 
Musical? When is that? 
- 7 : 00. 
- Okay, fantastic. 
I have to be there at 6 : 00. 
I'm the assistant choral mistress. 
Got somewhere to be? No. 
I'll catch him later. 
Is it going to hurt? 
Tess Sullivan? 
Sit with me? 
Great. 
Ten minutes till curtain. 
Articulate and project. 
And remember, it's all right if they don't understand the show as long as they... 
- Understand the words. 
- Understand the words. 
Where have you been? 
I've been looking all over for you, Lute. 
I drove by Good Shopping earlier and I didn't see you. 
What is going on? 
I'm not doing it anymore. 
I said I was sorry and I gave the stuff back, and besides, Mr. Babbitt says I've suffered enough. 
If I were you, Lute, I would steer very clear of Mr. Babbitt. 
He is part of the problem. 
He is not part of the... 
You know what? I don't even know why I'm wasting time with this nonsense! 
I have a show to do. 
Places, everybody! 
Places, everybody! 
No. Miss Little, I think you're wrong. 
And if that makes me part of the problem, too, then I guess that's just fine with me. 
We are here tonight to celebrate heroism. 
And now, I'd like to introduce the real creative juice behind tonight's festivities, our choir mistress and volleyball coach, Miss Penelope Little. 
We would like to dedicate tonight's performance not only to our beloved teacher in space, but also to the next generation of heroes. 
They could be our neighbors, or one of our fellow students. 
The young man I wish to honor tonight is both. 
He's one of our students, and he's my neighbor. 
He came upon our little Gustav choking in his cradle and he screwed his courage to the sticking place and came to the rescue. 
And so, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present tonight's Exemplary Citizenry Medal to James Arneson Lement. 
Jim, you're a hero! 
And now, let's blast off! 
And when you find what you're looking for 
Up there in the stars 
Don't forget why you went so far 
So far from our hearts 
You are going to tell us what you see 
You will enlighten us 
Better we will be 
Take me ashore. 
Are you sure? 
We don't have to. I'm feeling optimistic. 
Fenster! 
It's a miracle. 
Hey. You can breathe. 
I'm okay. 
You know, I just want you to know I don't have any expectations. 
I don't really expect... 
Why didn't you come to the lake today? 
I don't know. 
- You have a change of heart? - No. 
I was... 
I was with Tess. - What were you doing? 
- Helping her out with something. What is it? 
What's wrong? 
- I'm fine. 
- No, you're not. 
What did she say? Did she talk about me? 
No. 
Why would she? 
This wasn't about you. 
Well, I'm sorry. 
But, you know, Tess is very angry. 
She has her reasons. 
I know she does. 
- What do you know? 
- She's pregnant. 
Not anymore. 
Why did you go with her? 
Because she asked me to. Jesus. 
Yeah, but why you? 
She needed a friend and she asked me to sit with her. 
What, through the whole procedure? 
Yeah. 
I didn't know you two were so close. 
Well, we're a lot closer now. 
I'm a bit surprised. It must have been disturbing. 
No wonder you're so distant. 
- What is your problem? 
- I don't trust her. 
You don't need to protect me. 
You know, actually, I think I do. 
It was Tess that turned Sam in. 
- What are you talking about? 
- You. You and Sam. 
She saw you together in the Shed being intimate. 
That's not possible. 
Well, maybe it wasn't the Shed, then. 
Well, whatever. 
She saw you. 
Look, it's not possible that she saw anything between us. 
Not possible? 
- We never... - Never what? 
Tess lied. 
- You never what? - What do you want? 
You know, right now, the truth would be really fucking great. 
We never did it, okay? 
We never had sex. 
Well, okay, fine. 
Maybe she saw you doing something else. 
He was my teacher. 
That's all. 
So what are you telling me? I'm sorry. 
I'm trying to understand. 
- What about the necklace? 
- What about it? You gave it to him. 
He reached out for it. It was... 
We all gave it to him. 
It was from all of us, okay? 
I picked it out. 
- You lied. You said you were in love. 
- I was. 
- And that he loved you. 
- He did. Come on! 
You know what... 
You know what everyone was thinking, what everyone believed, what I believed, and what Tess clearly believed. 
Tess was lying. 
It seems like everyone was. 
Didn't anybody ever assume anything about you before, and you just let it stand? 
And when he was gone, even if it was a lie, that's all I had left of him. 
Can you understand that? 
Is it a crime? 
It can be. 
What do I do? 
You correct it. 
You tell the truth. 
I'm sorry. I have no right. 
I have no right whatsoever. I... 
- I lied, too. 
- I don't want to hear it. 
Sam and I... 
Angela. 
I don't want to hear it! 
Hey. 
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... 
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six five, four, three, two, one! ... five, four, three, two, one! 
- Countdown! 
- To a higher place 
- Countdown! - Countdown! 
Yeah, we're talking about space 
- Countdown! - Countdown! - To the Blast Off Challenger Show 
- To the Blast Off Challenger Show 
- Countdown! - Countdown! 
- To a higher place - To a higher place 
- Countdown! - Countdown! 
- Yeah, we're talking about space - Yeah, we're talking about space 
- It was you, wasn't it? 
- Miss Little? 
Don't you fucking deny it! 
How could you? After all I've... 
Hi. 
Is there a Campbell Babbitt staying here? 
How the hell did you ever find this place? 
- Donna. 
- Campbell. 
You never called me. 
Yes. 
No, I'm sorry. 
Well, if the mountain doesn't come to Mohammed, Mohammed comes to the mountain. 
What? 
You won the Pulitzer, the goddamn Pulitzer. 
Congratulations. 
And there's no time for navel-gazing. 
You have an interview with NBC in the morning, pre-launch coverage. 
They needed filler, so they're gonna squeeze you in between NASA geeks and Christa's Aunt Bitsy. 
- What do they want me to say? 
- They want you to talk about heroes. 
You're an expert now. 
Here, I bought you a suit. 
Well, I guess I'm gonna have to do it then. 
Good. 
Maybe I'll finally get an update on Angela. 
Angela. 
An update from you. 
- Yes, no, you will. 
- Good. 
Then I'll take you back. 
You don't have to do the Christa thing. Fuck it. 
- I was just trying to shake you up a little. 
- Yeah. 
Okay, well, I have a few details I have to wrap up for the morning. 
- So, I'll see you at 8 : 30? 
- Okay. 
Cam, you could at least... 
All right. 8 : 30. 
Don't be late. 
- I'll be early. 
- Right. 
Well, congratulations. 
Donna, could you have someone deliver this for me, please? 
Kerry, is the water coming like I asked? 
Jesus, I hope that doesn't keep up. 
So it's going to be to camera. 
Tom's in New York on a live feed through your earpiece. 
Kerry, where's his earpiece? 
You okay? 
Yeah, you're okay. 
- I thought you were leaving. 
- Not yet. 
You got your souvenir. Now get the fuck out of here. 
- I mean it. - Don't... 
Don't do that. 
What, am I ruining that king-of-the-mountain feeling you must be having right now? 
- Tess. - I just hope you wore a rubber. 
And listen, nothing happened. 
- Fuck you. 
- All right, then. 
A lot happened, more than it should have. 
But not what you think. 
Is that makeup? 
What are you doing? 
- I'm doing a TV interview. - Great. 
Look, before I... 
Before I tell the world... 
What... What are you talking about? 
Can I... Look. 
Come here, come here, please. 
TVs are set up, we're gonna watch Christa go, go, go! 
Tess. 
I want to talk to you about Angela. 
You know... 
I know. 
No. 
No, no, no. She... She killed herself. 
This is the truth. 
When I told you all she died, I didn't mean to be honest. 
The first article was the truth. 
She lost someone so dear to her, more precious than her own life, and I loved her. 
That's the truth. 
At least that's... That's how I felt. 
And the second article and the ones that followed, she was already dead. 
And now I'm being given an award for illuminating a life which she chose to end. 
I don't know if it's my fault, maybe, or... 
Come on, people, settle down. Take your seats. 
She was in pain. 
It was her choice. 
But I rejected her choice, and she deserves better. 
And I don't know what I deserve, but it's not a fucking award. 
What do you want from me? 
- Sam's dead. 
- I know. 
Thanks. 
I'm really not confused on that. 
And you didn't see him with Lucy, except perhaps in the way you wanted to see him. 
- You weren't there. 
- I know. 
- You don't know. 
- Lucy knows. 
- She doesn't know. 
- Come on. What? 
You didn't see the way they were together. 
After-school Romeo and Juliet. 
It was the way that he looked at her. 
It's the same way that you look at her. 
You have that same look. 
And how close did you come, huh? 
I was protecting her. 
You lied, and that's okay. 
I understand you were hurting. 
You know, I don't need your forgiveness. 
Okay? You have no idea what I was feeling. 
Don't I? 
We both believed what we need to believe. 
I'm sorry that Mr. C is dead, okay? 
You have no idea how sorry I am. 
But what am I supposed to do, go on TV and apologize? 
To who? 
He's the one that I need to apologize to, but he's not here to forgive me, is he? 
No, he's not! 
And it just makes me so mad. 
Not at him. 
Not at him, just at the way things are. 
At the way that things just disappear. 
Did you love her? 
Yes, I loved her. 
So, then why are you going to kill her again? 
So you can get something off of your chest? 
Well, what about the rest of us? 
The TVs aren't working. 
We're well aware of the problem. 
And please, please, settle down, everybody. 
She's so fair and beautiful, a true Juliet. 
I especially love when she turns a pirouette. 
In ten, nine, eight, seven... - Are you ready? 
- Yes, I'm ready. 
Yes, Tom, I am. 
Of course, no story is without its omissions. 
No journalist is completely objective. 
Because, Tom, the truth is... 
The truth is... 
What did you tell them? 
I told them. 
I told them she died. 
I told them she died a hero. 
We need as many as we can get, wouldn't you say? 
Hey, what about your award? 
- Award? 
- Yeah. 
Did you give it back? 
Well, you see, we can't all be heroes, you know? 
Some of us have to just sit on the curb and clap while they go by. 
Did you just make that up? 
Think so. 
See you. 
Okay. 
Good. 
Nine, eight, seven, six... 
We have main engine start. 
Four, three, two... 
When Jesus died, 
God guided the Apostles' pens and gave us the gospel truth... 
Excuse me Hey there! Mom! 
Do you mind? 
Emergency exit's 13D sweetie. 
Great, got it, thanks Dad 
Excuse me Bonjour Three chardonnay's please 
- No, nothing for me. I always remain alert in flight. 
- Me neither thank you 
Just the three then. 
I am so proud of you sweetie. 
A lot of women who just got dumped 
Would have backed out of this vacation but not you - Thanks Dad, but I didn't get dumped 
It wasn't quite like that it... - It was mutual 
Yes, they agreed to part ways 
When he dumped her 
I thought it was because he needed space? - No he just didn't find her spontaneous enough 
Too safe? 
Predictable. 
I am sitting right here. - I can hear you He tried to get you to go 
Bungie jump but you wouldn't do it 
I have a thing about heights and a rule about vomiting in public. 
I think that's perfectly reasonable Too many rules dear. 
There's nothing wrong with being cautious sweetie, 
- Safety is sexy 
The first time your mother and I made love we managed to keep our seatbelts on the entire time. 
OK Dad! 
What did I just say About vomiting in public? 
Change seats 
And the emergency exit is...? 
- 13D trust me, I know where it is. About to throw myself out of it.

Yeah, yeah, I will have his final bill ready to go 
You have my wife and I on the second floor - And my daughter on the third 
When I specifically booked adjacent rooms. 
I assure you your room is lovely Mr.... 
Lovely and adjacent are not the same thing 
She's a single woman Always alone Recently single. 
- I am not always alone. 
Dad, the room is fine can you just... 
Do you know how many push in robberies happen in hotels sweetie Third floor. 
- We'd like an ocean view. Always the same things with the rooms. 
Let Daddy do his thing. 
The little Frenchman will cave 
He's a weasel face like" you know who" 
Richard, I'm talking about Richard. 
I know Mother. 
We're not discussing him anymore - Remember? Right, right 
He's dead to us. - Yes! 
So it never bothered you that he had kind of a womanly butt? 
What? 
No he did not! 
Forget I said anything 
- I do not speak French 
Excuse me. 
- we have resolved the problem 
I'm gonna go check on my room You and Dad figure this out. 
You want a Maalox for the road? 
Wouldn't it be easier just to humour me? 
" bonjour" -" bonjour" 
Descente? 
I don't speak French. 
Yeah, no I got it the first time 
Why were you pretending back there? I don't know? 
Why did you follow me? I was already going to the beach

Just going to go to the restroom 
It's a crush Spence It happens 
Go shoot some guns And screw some models You'll be good as new Then what? 
Kill some more people 
They're enemies of the state. Not people 
Are you sure about that? 
Cause five years ago Levedeaux worked for us 
And then the NSA and god knows who else. But this week he's the enemy 
What the hell's wrong with you? 
You go and screw Polly Anna for a week And suddenly your life's work's out the window? 
She's normal And I feel normal when I'm with her. And maybe I... 
Wake up! Her world only exists because of people like us. 
And I'm sorry if people change sides Sometimes a friend becomes an enemy And you have to take them out. 
She trusts me. And I'm not willing to compromise that. 
These jobs are not optional Spencer. You don't get to just walk away 
Watch me. 
You are who you are Spencer! 
You can't change that 
I think the best part is you're finally with someone Who's genuinely attractive 
I know I know 
I keep thinking I'm going to build up some kind of tolerance to his.. Physical, Godlike Perfection 
Which just hasn't happened yet 
I'm Okay It's a little early Mom. Ha ha! 
( laughter ) Early... ( laughter ) 
Do you think they're all right up there? 
Oh, as long as Daddy doesn't shoot him We're good 
So I hear you're jobless. 
Corporate consul ting's a tough business sir. 
Jen and I were talking about putting some roots down. I might open up my own firm here. 
Look at my shoes They're Edward Greene. 
I picked them up 20 years ago When I was still flying the London route 
If you have something of great quality And you take good care of it. 
You'll have it forever. 
I know you're worried about Jen. 
Why would I worry? 
I am confident 
That you'll never hurt her. That's a nice shot. 
Thank you I was an Eagle Scout 
They really let you shoot stuff In the Boy Scouts? 
So do the Marines 
Semper Fi That was yours. 
I'm sorry I... You would have learned that in the Boy Scouts 
I was in 4H 
You know, Jen's not some fragile China doll. 
She's funny, and she's sweet. And she's smart 
But in this kind of an off kilter kind of way where one minute she could be talking about the strategic value of Nice in WWII 
And the next she's telling me that Carey Grant dropped acid. 
Which I... ( stuttering ) My point is... 
It doesn't matter what she says I can trust her. 
I depend on her Sir. It's not the other way around 
With your blessing 
I'm going to marry her. 
Welcome to the family Spencer. 
Thank you Mr. Cornfield Please...

Stick with us here at" Good Morning, New Jersey". Oh, my God. 
- Nice shot, Fred. 
You're a stud. - No problemo. 
Rain will fall when you go to the mall 
Later will clear, the sun will appear 
- Hi. Hey, I talked to Raymond in HR. 
He said the company's reorganizing all the stations and they've budgeted us for a new senior producer. 
They pulled your employment records. 
You're getting it, Becky. 
You're finally getting the job. 
Hey, kiddo, can you, uh, come by my office after the show? 
- Oh, me. 
- No, not me, you. 
Yes. 
What? 
What's going on? What is that? 
We thought you might need this. 
That better not be a box of condoms again and I didn't even use the old one. 
No, you're gonna use this. 
Oh, my God. 
- Congratulations. 
- Congrats. That's so sweet. 
Becky, we have to let you go. 
I'm really sorry about this, kiddo. 
Corporate wants us to reduce our overhead. 
We're having to make big cuts and they want me to hire a senior producer with more business experience to manage the contraction of the show. 
But wait a second. 
You told them you can't do that, right? 
Because I... I've been here so long and I've worked so hard. 
His name is Chip. 
He's... 
Chip starts Monday. He has an M.B.A. and a journalism degree from Columbia. 
They're grooming him to run the whole station in a few years. 
In the meantime, I can't afford to keep you both. 
- Becky, look, I'm really... 
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit. 
Shitty... Becky, I... 
I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry. 
- I fought them as hard as I could. - There's lots of terrific opportunities out there, you know? 
I mean, look at... 
Chip. 
He got one. 
So, maybe this is just the push I need, you know? 
So it can get me to the next level, maybe even to... to a network or... - Yeah. 
- I mean, it's... it's not like it's my whole life. It's only work, right? 
Did you get any severance? 
There were some budgetary cuts last year, so they weren't really offering. 
But I have feelers out. 
Lots. Yeah, great. Honey, you think the" Today Show" 
is gonna call you up and hand you a job, and you have since you were eight, - and it's not gonna happen. 
- I don't, I know that, I do, I get it. 
This is partly my fault. 
I... I let your father get your hopes up. 
He was not a happy person, let's face it. 
When he saw you aim high, he started to feel better about himself, 
- so I never said anything. - What are you saying? 
You had a dream, you know? 
Great. When you were eight, it was adorable. 
When you were 18, it was inspiring. 
At 28, it's officially embarrassing. 
And I just want you to stop before we get to heartbreaking. 
On my BlackBerry, it shows that you got my e-mail, so I was just wondering if... 
Yeah, it shows when someone's opened it. 
Hello? Becky Fuller. Yeah. 
I just wanted to make sure that you got that... resume that I e-mailed you. 
You did. Great. 
Becky Fuller again. 
Um, I was just wondering if... 
Yes, I did call yesterday, but I updated my resume last night and thought you might... 
I'm calling... because I was checking up on the position and I was wondering if it had been... 
- Hi. 
Becky Fuller. 
- Hi. Oh, hi, this is Jerry Barnes calling from IBS in New York. 
How are you? 
- Uhh, good. 
- Terrific. 
Listen, I'm calling cause I received your resume, all five of them, actually. 
And it just so happens, uh, that we're looking for somebody at the moment. 
I'll take it. Well, wait, I haven't told you what it is yet. 
- Sorry. 
- Well, our morning show - has a vacancy and so... 
- I'll take it! 
So, we're interviewing a bunch of people. Maybe you can come in 
- and we can have a talk. - Sure! 
Absolutely. Just tell me where to go and who to talk to. 
Okay, I'll get you e-mail with the details of where we are in the city. 
- Sorry! 
- And shall we say 3 o'clock? 
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you! 
Oscar says you're very talented and you work incredibly hard. 
Says you're the most promising producer that he's ever fired. 
Oh, well, that's, that's good. 
I... think. Uh, so, you're a fan of our morning program? 
- Oh, eah, I think it has so many... 
- Yeah, yeah, we know it's terrible. 
Perpetually in fourth place behind the" Today show"," Good Morning America" 
and that thing on CBS, whatever it's called. 
It's a source of constant humiliation. 
Last year, in the network softball league, the CBS team wore hats that said" At least we're not Daybreak." 
The anchors of the show are difficult and semi-talented. 
- Oh, I think Colleen Peck is a pro. 
- Heinous. - Paul McVee is a fine reporter. 
- Foul. 
Okay. Is" Daybreak" a shitty show? 
Yes. But it's on a network. 
And not just any network. 
This is one of the most legendary news divisions in the entire history of television!" Daybreak" just needs someone who believes in it, who understands that a national platform is an invaluable resource, that no story is too low or too high to reach for! 
Are you gonna... sing? 
Look, Mr. Barnes. 
Jerry. " Daybreak"' s facilities are antiquated. 
It's understaffed, underfunded. 
Oh! And the pay. 
It's awful, about half of what you made at" Hey, How The Hell Are You, New Jersey?" 
You've never been an executive producer. 
You're too young. 
Nobody's ever heard of you. 
And here, your education, three, not four years, at Fairleigh Dickinson in Teaneck, also known as Fairly Ridiculous. 
" Daybreak" needs what I need, someone who believes that it can succeed. 
Trust me, I know you don't have any reason to believe in me, but I work harder than anyone else. 
I'm in first, I'm out last. 
I know a shitload more about the news than someone whose daddy paid them to smoke bongs and talk semiotics at Harvard and I devote myself completely to my job. 
It's what I do. 
It's all I am. 
I... 
Well, that's... embarrassing. 
Okay. 
Thanks for the tour, and, uh... thanks for, uh... for... 
It's these buttons right here. 
Oh, oh. 
Lobby. Yes, thanks. 
Good day so far? 
I don't think so. 
I talked too much. 
Ruined it. 
Damn it. 
Sir... 
I am such a huge admirer of yours. I'm a... 
I'm a big, huge fan. I... 
Oh, my whole family watched you, growing up. 
I... Of all the anchors, you were, by far, the greatest reporter. 
I mean when-when-when-when you were in Kosovo, I was in Kosovo. 
- She work for you? 
- No. 
I'm just here to teach her how to use the elevator. 
Are you done? 
Yes, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
May I? 
Oh, God, sorry. I... 
Of course, of course. 
Oh, my God, I can't believe I just met the... 
- Wait a second. You know him. - Yes, I do know him. 
He's the third worst person in the world. 
- Hello? 
- Becky Fuller. 
- Yes? - You sure you can do this job? 
Yes. - You start on Monday. 
- Thank you. 
Yes, I am calling about the, uh, one-bedroom. 
Yes, I'm moving into town. I've got a new job. 
I'm extremely neat and tidy. 
In summer camp the kids used to pay me to make their beds. Yeah. 
Sorry, that was an overshare. 
No loud music. 
No kids. I don't even have a boyfriend. 
Just me. I'll take it. 
I'll take it, I'll take it. 
Sorry! 
Also, we'll have more on the flooding in Iowa. 
Finally, some good weather news on the way for those folks. 
So please, join us tomorrow and thank you for spending 
- your morning here at Daybreak. - Take care, everyone. 
- Are you interviewing at" Daybreak"? 
- Goodbye. Assistant? 
Intern? 
Uh, no. 
Actually, I'm the new executive producer. 
Another one? 
Don't unpack. 
Miss Fuller? 
Lenny Bergman, senior producer. 
Yes. I-I... I know who you are. 
You started out at WABC. You were at CBS for two years 
- and, uh, here for 13. 
- Yeah, wow. 
- Here, let me, let me give you a hand. 
- Oh, uh, I just have one question. Um... - Sure. 
- Why haven't they bumped you up? 
It's not for me. I did it for a couple of weeks once, but they put me back at number two. 
Apparently, the crying was distracting. 
You'll love it, though. It's a great job. 
- Oh, our morning meetings are at five. 
- Isn't that kind of late? 
- Late? 
- I mean, well, it's just that... I'm, I'm used to, uh, early hours, so... 
Well, maybe we should try better doughnuts. 
Excuse me. Uh, at the" Today Show", the... senior staff is usually... 
Hi.... in by 4 : 30... 
We're just like the" Today Show", except, you know, without the money, - viewers, respect... 
That's... that's one of our good doorknobs. 
I'll take care of this. Colleen Peck has been here forever. Don't... don't mention that. 
But McVee is paid more. Don't mention that, either. 
They hate each other. Don't mention that. 
But that's because Colleen hates everybody. Don't mention that. 
And she used to sleep with McVee, who threw her over for her assistant. 
Do not mention that. 
Got it. - After you talk to Colleen... - Yeah, yeah? 
Make sure you get me before you talk to McVee, so I can go with you. 
- Why? 
- I don't... Just trust me, okay? 
- Okay. 
- Okay. - Okay. - Good. 
- Can I just... - Sure. Okay, you ready? 
- I'm ready. 
Do you know how many EP's I've had in the past 11 years? 
- Um... 
- Fourteen. If they're stupid, they get fired, and if they're smart, they quit. 
And now... look what I get. 
Um, well, um... - It's a real pleasure... - You think it's fun being in last place? 
Do you think I enjoy working for a network that spends more on one episode of a dating show about a bachelor dwarf than our entire weekly budget? 
- And... I've never had - a decent co-anchor ever! 
- We're gonna change... 
Just a revolving door of cretinous morons. 
Our ratings are in the crapper. 
I mean, how long can this show limp along like this? 
I know that everyone's been through a lot, and-and I know that there's been so many challenges along the way. 
But, you know... You will fail like everyone else and then you'll be gone, like everyone else. 
But I will still be here, pulling the train up the hill with my teeth. 
You think it's fun getting your ass kicked? 
- No... - Welcome to" Daybreak". 
Enjoy the pain, Gidget. 
No! It's okay. 
I have it! I've done this a zillion times and... 
- I'm gonna fix that and... 
- See you later! 
Good-good talking to you. 
Paul! Hi! I'm... 
I'm-I'm Becky Fuller. 
Your new EP. 
Thrilled to meet you. 
Uhh, I was just thinking maybe we could go over a few ideas. 
I was thinking maybe we could, uh, get you on the street and do some remotes. 
Yeah, I don't like to leave the studio. I like climate control. 
But, uh, if you want, we could discuss this further privately. 
- What size are your feet? 
Hm? - You wear about a six and half? 
Seven? - Pardon? How do you feel about having them photographed? 
Good? Feel good about that? 
You should. I keep' em very classy. 
I... don't... 
Can I show you my blog? " Sexy Feet"? 
- No. - Yes? 
No. 
- Well, I met Paul. 
- You talked to him alone? - I told you to come see me first. 
- I know, but... What was I gonna do? 
Hi. Hi, everyone. 
Hi, I-I-I'm Becky. Hi. 
Good morning. 
Oh, God, look who's here. 
I mean not here. 
McVee. 
So shocking, huh? Yeah, well, Mr. McVee doesn't always come to these things. 
Oh, um... Could you tell Paul that we need him, please? 
Thanks. 
Um, okay, so let's just dive in, shall we? 
Who-who wants to start? 
Tomorrow Rocco DiSpirito wants to make lasagna. 
I told him we did that last week with the Barefoot Contessa, 
- but he's insisting. What do I do? 
- For the segment on miniskirts, - do you want all size models? 
- Next week, I want to do a piece on juice cleanses. 
All the celebs are doing them and they have amazing powers of rejuvenization. 
My idea is that I get a juice cleanse and then we can, like, 
- measure my toxins... 
- For the Carville interview... 
I'm sorry, Lisa, do you want the living room set or the stools? 
ABC says we can't have Eva Longoria until two weeks after 
- she does G.M.A. What do we do? 
- On psychic animals, would you prefer a parakeet or an iguana? 
I'd like to do a piece on weathervanes. They are fascinating. 
Like, did you know the word" vane" comes from the Old English" fana", 
- which means flag or weathercock? - Friday, for cooking with squash, - inside or on the plaza? 
- Okay, they're offering us the third lead in the new Patrick Dempsey movie. 
Do you want him? 
Great story out of Tampa about a retirement account scandal. 
But we gotta move quick. Should we send a team or just local talent? 
... control room's on the fritz. 
Ten grand to fix it. 
For that piece on baby food, do we want an actual baby, and if so, white, black, Hispanic, Asian, blonde hair, brown hair, teeth, or no teeth? 
I have a black baby at home. 
I'm sorry, I can't hear what you're saying. I... 
Hello! Hi, hi. 
Someone wanna tell me why I had to log off 
Asshole. 
Tell Rocco if he insists on making lasagna, he will be bumped. 
Yes, all size models, but skirts not too short. 
Toxins? Who said that? Yeah. 
They can't be measured. And" rejuvenization," not a word. 
Tell Longoria's people that she can't plug her next film unless we get her within a week of G.M.A. 
Parakeet. Ernie, weathercock? 
Seriously? The plaza for squash. 
I want Patrick Dempsey. 
Tell his people we'll run him in the first hour and he can talk about whatever his thing is. 
Tampa Bay, definitely local talent. 
And we've got to fix that sound board. 
Find ten grand in the budget somewhere. 
The hair and makeup numbers, those were too high. 
So, Colleen, could you share your hair person with Lisa? 
That'd be great, great. 
Okay. Asian baby, no teeth. 
- Lesbian parents. - Okay. 
Did I miss anything? Oh, Paul! 
Uh... you're fired. 
- You're adorable. 
I'm sorry. That was unprofessional. 
Congratulations. 
The first day, you flushed your anchor and you got no money to pay for another one. 
He was lowering the morale of the show. 
How is that possible? 
Look, you must have someone under contract. 
A local anchor, a reporter. 
I'll find someone. I'll-I'll promote from within. 
That'll be great for morale! 
Go nuts. Find somebody great. It just can't cost me a penny. 
What if I gave them one of my three pennies? 
Whatever it takes. 
Just get the ratings up. 
Lenny, hi. 
Yeah. Very positive. He thinks we have terrific options. 
... plunge 200 points right before closing. 
- Analysts fear that this... 
- He's not bad. 
Yeah, he's okay. Put a saddle on him, he's good to go. 
-... are not happy. 
- Should we watch 86 again? 
I gotta get home, see the kids, or the wife is gonna kill me. 
You have kids? 
What? 
No. 
No? Husband? 
Boyfriend? 
Me? 
What? 
No. - No, I'm sorry. Stupid question. 
- Um, you know... 
- You're hideous and repulsive. - You know what? Forget 86. 
I think that we should watch the Miami guy again,' cause he was, I mean, you know, he was a little bit tan, but I think... 
I think that we could just wipe that off, it's probably just one of those self-tanner things. 
I could, you know, fix that. 
Good night. 
Hey, look. It's Mike Pomeroy's fangirl. 
... Hello. - Hey. 
That was you. That was really embarrassing. 
I may need to have you killed. 
I'm... I'm Becky... 
Fuller. Sorry. " Becky Fuller" Becky Fuller? 
The one who took out McVee? 
You're a legend already. 
- Uh, thanks. 
- I'm Adam Bennett. I'm a producer upstairs at" Seven Days". 
- Hello. 
- So, you lookin' for a new anchor? 
- Yes. 
- Oh, not that guy. 
You can't use that guy. That's the horse guy. 
Oh, he's not too bad. I mean, as long as we leave our hand flat when we feed him a carrot.... 
- Well, good luck, Becky Fuller. 
- Thank you, Adam... 
Bennett? - Need any help? 
- Uh, no. 
I'm good. Thanks. 
The sports guy from St. Louis is not bad. 
Let's watch him again. 
No, we need some gravitas. 
We need... we need people to trust us. 
I mean, you know, if news breaks on the air, we need to be able to cover it credibly. 
What, do you actually think that we can cover breaking news? 
- God, that's adorable. 
- Thousands gathered today to see if the tiny buck-toothed creature would spot his own shadow. 
But the sad truth is, according to Punxsutawney Phil, this bitter winter is far from over. 
Back to you, Mike. 
What? 
Yesterday, the Secretary of State held a top-level 
- State Department security brief... 
- What's funny? 
- You put Seabiscuit back in? - But we agree that Hezbollah has shown a willingness to continue to attack. 
- Becky? - Can I call you back? 
... Israeli incursions. 
What steps are you taking to limit these Hezbollah retaliations? 
You have Pomeroy under contract, right? 
Yeah. He was supposed to do stories for one of our magazine shows. 
- Yeah? - We couldn't use anything he pitched. 
- Nothing? 
- An eight-part story on the United Nations. 
An interview with a Pashtu warlord. A piece on microfinance in Asia? 
It's all been so tempting. 
- Jerry! - So we're just paying him to sit there. 
Wait. But he must have millions on his contract. 
You have a world-caliber news man with nothing to do! 
- Becky, this is... - No, Pomeroy has reported on every major story of the last three decades, with integrity and courage! 
I mean, he was the only anchor to go down to Ground Zero on the day. 
His Q ratings, I looked at them, they're unbelievable, 
- and you're already paying him. 
- I have to go. 
We'll discuss this. 
I... I wanna look at his contract! 
I'm sorry. 
Hi. I wa... I need your approval to look at his contract. 
Please. 
Hi. Hi. 
I'm Becky Fuller and, uh... 
And what the hell are you doing here? 
I'm the producer of" Daybreak" and we're actually looking for a new anchor. 
Then why are you here? 
Well, it's funny that you should ask. 
Go... away. 
Okay, just hear me out, because the show actually has a lot of potential. 
We're starting over basically, and with an anchor as esteemed and respected as yourself, sir... 
You've been a journalist your whole life, ever since, um, your elementary school paper, The Beaverton Bee. 
I mean, you've gotta miss it. You... News breaks, it must just kill you 
- not to be out there. - Morning shows don't do news. 
Jesus," Daybreak". 
Half the people that watch your show have lost their remote. 
The other half are waiting for their nurse to turn them over. 
If I wanted to come back, I could have any job I chose. 
But you can't work on another network for another two years. 
So I'll continue to enjoy my life on IBS's dime. 
All right, all right, I didn't wanna have to do this. 
I really didn't. 
- I looked at your contract. - What? 
- With the lawyers. 
- My contract? 
And you're right. They do have to pay you through the last two years of your contract. 
Unless six months have elapsed without you appearing on the air in any capacity. 
Then, if the network offers you an official position and you don't take it, they can terminate your contract and the six million dollars that you have left on it. 
So, here's me with an official offer. 
Mike Pomeroy, the IBS network would like to offer you the position of co-host of" Daybreak". 
- You're joking. 
- No. 
Do you have any idea what's going on in the world? 
And you want me to do stories about baked Alaska? 
After the career that I've had? 
You just need to have an open mind. 
- Open mind. - I mean, yes, the morning news 
- has a wider range of stories... 
- A wider range? 
! Your program is in the news department, you cretin! 
News is a sacred temple. 
And you're part of the cabal that's ruining it with horseshit! 
That's not actually fair. 
Because the first half hour of a morning show is a damn fine news broadcast. 
Sure, we cover the news and entertainment... 
That's everything a newspaper has ever done. 
There's nothing wrong with that. 
Think of it this way : We're like a well-informed neighbor, coming over to chat with people in the morning. 
You know, Brokaw did the morning news. And Charlie Gibson. 
Walter Cronkite did it at the beginning of his career. 
I mean, he co-hosted a morning program with a puppet named Charlemagne. 
Well, then... get a puppet. 
It's inexpensive and uses things you already have around the house. 
You can make... globes, hats, especially pinatas. 
Now, macher means" to chew" in French, but we're not actually going to be eating any of this, right? 
Of course not! No. 
Coming up next, you've heard her sing. 
Well, today, you're going to hear about her sweet tooth. 
Join us as we bake brownies with Celine Dion's personal chef. 
All that and more, coming up on..." Daybreak". 
- We're clear! 
- Oh, my God, will somebody please get this off? 
- Thank you very much. - Okay, so, we don't have time for the sit-down, so we're just gonna run the package, all right? 
- You okay? 
- What? 
Don't beat yourself up. 
He was never gonna do it. 
Pomeroy? 
- How did you know that? 
- Mike was never gonna come to work at this little dog and pony show, especially not working for somebody 
- like, well, I'm sorry, but... you. 
- Okay. Like... yeah. You. 
Not in a thousand years. 
I mean, obviously, don't get me wrong, 
I would've... I would've welcomed him with open arms. 
Oh, my God. 
I've won eight Peabodys. 
A Pulitzer. Sixteen Emmys. 
I was shot through the forearm in Bosnia. 
Pulled Colin Powell from a burning jeep. 
I laid a cool washcloth on Mother Teresa's forehead during a cholera epidemic. 
I've had lunch with Dick Cheney. 
You're here for the money. 
That is correct. 
Five, four, three... 
Oh, fuck! 
Welcome back to" Daybreak". God, does he cook? 
Does he do... 
I don't know, fashion segments and gossip? 
Does he have three-year-old octuplets barf all over' im like I did last year? 
Well, unfortunately, in the' 80s, someone gave him story refusal rights, so no. 
I don't care. Does he know that this is called morning television? 
Yes, and I think that after a little bit of time, he's really gonna want to do a mix of stories. 
Face it! 
I'm going to end up making turkey meatballs with Mario Batali 
- for the rest of my natural life. 
- I need the new titles ASAP. 
Okay, let's move it. Single malt. 
We've got the hand soap, we got the mixers, the papers, the tropical fruit. 
Here we go. Whoever heard of mangosteen? 
- Apparently, he has. 
Colleen's dressing room and... - This is... 
She's so looking forward to seeing you. 
Good. Great. Glad to hear it. 
And, uh... this is mine? 
Yes, but Colleen is, uh... 
You got me the newspapers? 
The mixers? 
The tropical fruit plate. 
All stipulated in your ten-page rider. 
- Nice of you. 
- Yes... 
Colleen wants me, I'll be in here. 
Okay. 
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
- Okay. 
- What the hell is that? 
No hurry. 
No, no and no. 
Okay. Did you tell her I have papaya in here? 
He gets a tropical fruit plate? 
That is just so pathetic. 
That guy might be our only hope. So I suggest you just man up and get in there! 
Ooh! That is such a good speech! 
Guess what? 
I'm... not going. 
So, we'll be shooting Mike's promos all week and then, uh, we'll finalize the format of the show on Friday. 
And then we'll rehearse Mike's openings and some segues. 
Excuse me. 
Who is going to say goodbye? 
- Pardon? 
- Well, at the end of the show? 
Oh, uh... 
It doesn't really matter. I mean, Mike, you don't mind if Colleen says goodbye? 
Well, who do you think the public would rather hear from last? 
Someone who's won every broadcast award on the face of the planet or the former Miss... 
Pacoima? It's Arizona! 
In case you're interested, I was Miss Arizona! 
We can't both have our arms folded. 
And I am the female here, I think. 
- Colleen on this side. 
- Of course, I'd be more than happy to. 
Can you just step away, just for a second? Thanks. 
Hello? ! - Is that better? 
- What's next? 
Bubble bath? 
- Hi. Hey, I just came to... 
to offer my condolences on hiring the third worst person in the world. 
Thanks. 
Yes. I... Um... 
Who are the other two? 
Oh, Kim Jong-Il and... Angela Lansbury, actually. 
- She knows what she did. 
- Okay. So, I, uh, I gather that you worked with Mike at the nightly news. 
Worst year of my life. 
The entire time we worked together, the only thing he ever called me was Senor Dipshit. 
It's not funny. 
- I'm sorry, that's not funny. - No. That's terrible. 
That is terrible, actually. Yeah, so, um... 
So now is an excellent time for you to take up drinking. 
And I came by to say that sometimes after work, a few of us go over to Schiller's on Madison, so, um, you know, if you're... ever around... And, uh... 
- Around. 
- Yeah, available. 
Oh, okay. 
Yeah. Um... Uh, that, uh, would be nice. 
Yeah, I... 
I don't, I don't really go out very much, but, um, if I'm in the neighborhood, - I will definitely stop by and say hi. 
- Well, like tomorrow. 
- Around eight. - Okay. Yeah, sounds good. 
- All right. 
- Sure, yeah. - Bye. 
That's not too shabby. 
You got a new anchor. 
Somebody asked you out on a date. 
Things are lookin' up. 
Um, that was... 
He... Not asking me out on a date. 
I think it was. 
I was standin' right there. - Uh, no, no. - Yeah. 
I mean... 
Oh, come on, please, I think I would know if I was being asked out on a date. 
- It's a date. - So, we've got the bird whisperer - confirmed for... 
Tuesday? - Yes. Great. 
And, uh, Al Green on the plaza Wednesday. 
- Two songs. - Okay. And Colleen, do you wanna do the interview between the songs? 
No, let me. 
Yeah, I'll do it. Okay. 
Mike, so, we have this great story on children's water safety. 
- That's the... - Not my thing. 
Okay, how about a rundown of the new shows on fall television season? 
The boom in organic farming. Very hot topic right now. 
That's newsy, right? 
What do you want me to do? 
Fire another anchor? Then we're gonna be stuck with that guy who counts with his hooves. 
Colleen can't do every story that's not hard news. 
It's Mike Pomeroy. He's a legend. 
You know, what am I supposed to tell him? 
- There she is. 
- What...? Oh, hi. 
Interesting. Jerry hired you. 
No polish. No pedigree. 
Those bangs. 
What was he thinking? 
Just wondering. 
- He's a peach. 
- Yeah. 
Coming soon to" Daybreak" : 
one of the most legendary newsmen of all time. 
Soon, he'll be bringing his experience to morning television. 
Let Mike Pomeroy show you the world over your first cup of coffee! 
- Oh, for Christ's sake. 
- What? 
What, what, what is it now? It's embarrassing. 
I mean, wha-wha-what's in the briefcase? 
- What do you mean? 
What? - Special anchorman papers? 
- It doesn't matter. 
- My lunch? Where am I going? 
- We've been over this eight times! 
- I'm running to nowhere. - I look like a jackass! 
- No... Yes, you do. 
You know, whoever gave you promo approval was smoking crack! 
- I want to meet that person. 
- I was mopping the floor - with Peter Jennings at the time. 
- I want to have words with... I could have had hookers and eight balls written into my contract. 
- How nice for you. 
-... over your first cup of coffee. 
Why do we have to mention that first cup of coffee? 
Why not just say " Watch Mike Pomeroy before your morning dump?" 
So for the fashion segments, I think it's important that we interpret runway trends for our viewers because they're not all six foot and size zero. 
- Man, he's cute. 
- I went to Yale with him. 
- Shut up. 
- You did not. Everyone was madly in love with him. 
Actually, just me and every single person I knew. Yeah. 
- Can we just...? - His dad was editor of Newsweek. 
His mom's family is rich as hell. 
They own like Tupperware or something. 
He rowed crew for Yale when they won the national championship. 
Hi. 
- You know him? - No. 
Yeah, well, yes, I mean, I... 
- Yes. - Don't you think he's smokin'? 
- Smokin'. 
- Yeah. I don't know, I don't know. 
Let me see. I... 
I don't know. - Not a hard question. 
- He's walking away. 
So... jeans and... belts. 
Well, you know, I asked him to do a piece on Trump. 
And he actually picked up my Diet Coke and hurled it across the room. 
- Wow, he picked it up. 
- Just missed me. 
He did. 
I asked him to cover a bumper crop of cranberries and he slapped me in the face. 
- He did? 
- It's true. - Really? - Of course, he was drunk off his ass. 
Adam! - Hi. 
- Oh, hi. How are you? - I'm good. 
- Hi. - You never called me! 
- Uh... I'm sorry. 
We, uh... I was... I've been workin' a lot. 
Well, uh, maybe I'll see you at Barton's regatta party on Saturday. 
- Great, great. 
- Okay, great. 
- Sorry, I was just... 
- Oh, that's okay. 
Absolutely fine. That's fine, fine. 
- Bye. 
- So, um... anyway, the reason that I came by, uh, tonight, was, uh, because I don't really know that many people who know Mike, and I thought, that, you know, I could get, uh, your professional feedback. 
- My feedback? 
- Yeah, you know. 
I mean, cause I'm actually new in town and I don't... 
- Come on. - Oh, no, please. 
... have that many work contacts, so... 
Great. So... we'll be contacts? 
Oh, that would be great. 
Well, you can never have enough of those. 
No, you can't. So, uh, definitely be seeing you around. 
- Okay. 
- Okay. 
Shit. 
Okay. Good rehearsal. 
Good stuff. 
So, uh, let's just alternate the voiceover intros of the headlines. 
- Okay. - And then ad-lib. 
So, let's say, for example, we're doing a story about, I don't know, 
- a midterm election. 
- But we won't. 
Because the morning shows don't do news. Pompous. 
That's really interesting. 
That's a different color for you. 
That's, uh... 
Okay, and you two should just sort of, you know... banter back and forth a little bit. 
Banter, from the Latin word, meaning" to gibber like a moron"? 
Just, you know, talk about the headlines. 
That's... that's what I mean. 
I'm not gonna sit here and rehearse like I'm in summer stock. 
I've been on the air for 40 years, for Christ's sake. I think I know how to... ad-lib. 
The spill began when the tanker was damaged in heavy seas outside Galveston. 
Knock, knock. 
Oh, can I come in? 
Uh, I just, uh, wanted to say, you know, um, good luck. 
Colleen's Pap smear. 
A television classic. 
Uh, are you... drunk? 
Insufficiently. 
- to contain the... - That's my chair. 
What? 
That's where I belong. 
... authorities have asked the federal government... Took it away from me, those motherfu... 
I-I think maybe you should just, you know, go home and... 
- See this? -... rest. 
Yes. What is that? 
Forty-year-old Bruichladdich. 
I only drink this when I'm practically suicidal. 
Okay. 
Oh, you're-you're very funny. 
Uh, uh, well, I'm gonna see you tomorrow... right? 
I thought that I might swing by to see if, uh... 
What are you working on? Uh... 
Well, we're working on a piece on the communist rebels in the Philippines. 
Good. 
That sounds great. So I went to the bar the other night to see you. 
Yeah, I could tell. By the way you ran in the other direction. 
Your arms, pinwheeling. 
Yeah. Okay, fair, true. 
I think that you're sort of... comically great. 
And I thought it seemed so promising so I bungled it, because that's what I do. 
I bungle things. 
I bungle and I ramble, and that's kind of like what I'm doing right now, talking about it. 
You threw me off guard. 
You, with your... And the... and the, this... 
And the... 
My working on a loom? 
- My, my... 
- No. -... double-handed craps. 
- I... - My Jazzercise. 
- Rowing. Rowing. 
- Rowing? 
- Championship? 
I never would have got that. 
You know what I mean. 
That I didn't think that you... 
liked me. 
But I do. 
Oddly. You're... different. 
And a deeply terrible mime. 
Well, I asked you out. Then when I saw you at the bar, 
I practically tackled you to the ground. 
What part of that was confusing? 
Here, here, here, sit down. 
Look, my-my radar for that kind of thing is so bad. 
I-I mean, I don't know if a man's interested in me until he's naked. 
I mean, the pants come off and then I'm like, " Oh, I guess you don't really want to see my CD collection 
- or talk about... 
Kerouac." - You're nuts. 
Okay, look. Let's start over. 
Let's go out to dinner like... regular people. 
Just take it slowly, just... see where it leads. 
- How does that sound? 
- That sounds... perfect. 
Oh, God, I should go home. 
Oh, it's eight! 
It's eight already. 
- I know. 
- It's Mike's first day tomorrow. 
- You should definitely go. - What's the big whoop? 
I mean, you know, he's done this like a million times before. 
- Yeah. - And he knows exactly what he's doing. 
- So... It's fine. 
He didn't open a bottle of 40-year-old Bruichladdich, did he? 
How do you know that? 
What? 
When I was working with him, if there was something that he didn't want to do, the Oscars, the Olympics, something that people might actually get a tiny twinge of pleasure from, the night before, he would go on a bender. 
Call in sick for work the next day. 
No. 
No, no. This is ridiculous. I-I'm not... 
I'm not going out there and chasing him around. 
If he wants to screw this up, that is his problem. 
- Start at Elaine's. 
- Oh, God, thank you. Thank you. 
I'm sorry. 
We'll do it again sometime. 
Thanks. 
- Pomeroy? 
- Yeah. He was here. He left about an hour ago. 
Oh, no. The little woman. 
- Incoming. 
- Jesus Christ, Pomeroy, they're getting younger and younger. 
Mike. I need to talk to you. 
Why? 
Is the baby mine? 
I will have you know that this show is very important to a lot of people, including, but not limited, to me. 
My ass is on the line here. 
Actually, your ass is irrelevant. 
You're just a footnote. 
It's my ass, my reputation, my integrity. 
Mine! 
" Mine!" You're such an egotistical, selfish person! 
I'm on-air talent! 
Get in. 
Okay, I'm home. You can leave. 
Oh, no. No. 
Oh, my God. 
Is-is that a real...? 
Of course. 
You're alone tonight, huh? 
- Makes sense. 
Let me guess. 
You meet a guy. 
You have about three dates. Spend the whole time talking about your job. 
He loses your phone number. 
Aside from your... 
obvious father issues, what'd he do? 
Leave you? 
You've got this... repellent moxie. 
Look at all the stories you could be doing here. 
About art and hunting and fishing... 
I mean, you have grandchildren. I-I didn't even know you had kids. 
Look, we could be doing parenting segments. 
You should invite them down to the show. 
The ungrateful little bastards. 
I don't think so. 
Well, the little tour's over. 
Time to go back to your sad little life. 
I'm not going anywhere until we are on the air. 
Well, please don't snore. I'm a light sleeper. 
I'm not going to be sleeping. 
Good night. 
- Good night. 
- Good night. 
Let's go, girl. 
- What are you doing? 
- Have you ever seen a real egg? 
These are from pastured hens in Maryland. 
- Yeah. We have to go. 
- I have them delivered once a week. 
We have to go. 
Now, the beauty of a frittata is that it can be made with any ingredient. 
Anything that's in your refrigerator. - Good. 
Get dressed. - What? You want me to starve? 
I've got to be in tip-top shape. 
I'm going to appear on national television in front of... 
- what? Six or eight people. 
- Mike, come on. 
Coffee? 
What few people know is that the frittata was meant to be eaten at room temperature. 
- It was invented in Italy... 
- Come on. 
-... for the afternoon repast. 
- Look, guess what? 
I don't really care about your epicurean breakfast, okay? 
I just need you to walk faster, because we are going to be late. 
- Hello, there. - Where the hell have you been? 
- It's a long story. 
She spent the night at my place. 
Oh, come on, everyone. 
I slept on the couch. 
Until I woke her up with my... African rain stick. 
All right. Okay. It's Mike's first show, so it's a really big day for us. 
- Fire me today. 
Okay. What are they promoing on the" Today Show" today? 
- What aren't they promoing? - What? 
Crap. No. Vieira scored that interview with the... drunk-driving Playboy Playmate? 
What's on G.M.A.? 
- Well, she's doin' Clooney. 
Yeah. - Bitch. 
Try not to bore the nation into a coma with your dull news crap, okay? 
Yes, certainly. 
Oh, and, uh, suck it. 
Well, they look great together, so that's promising. 
Oh, heavenly ghost of Edward R. Murrow. 
Okay, the Jewish guy is crossing himself, so we're confident. 
Thirty seconds to air. 
Everybody ready? 
- They know about the cake? 
- Mm-hm. Everybody does? Stage manager's got that covered? 
Good. 
- I want the double matte through both names, both names. - Cake is good to go. D-Day. 
Great. 
Okay, stand by all... 
Stand by, ticker. 
Stand by, Deko, that's great. 
- You ready for this? - I'm ready. 
Are you ready? Stand by, announce. 
Here we go and roll nine. Take nine. 
- We're good so far. 
- Stand by to go on four. 
-... on Daybreak. - And go on four. - Seven. 
- Reveals four. - There they are. - Five. 
-... and Mike Pomeroy. 
- Go dissolve to Mike and cue them. 
Good morning, everyone. 
Uh, before we begin, today is a historic moment here on" Daybreak". 
Today's the day that... 
Mike Pomeroy joins our little show. 
We are so lucky to have a journalist of your caliber here with us, Mike. 
We're just... what can we say except, welcome, welcome. 
Yes. 
- He said yes. 
- That's it? 
- Yes? 
- Yes. - He said yes. - You gotta be kidding me. 
- That's great. 
- That's all it is. - Hey, bring on the cake. 
- We have a little surprise for you. - Push in the cake. 
- Happy First Day to you - Happy First Day to you. 
- Happy First... 
- Thank you. 
- Now on to today's top stories. - Go, take it. 
In Texas today, severe weather continues to plague the Gulf Coast. 
He's not buyin' it. 
Okay, all right, very good. So far, he's a cozy blanket. 
I need 22. 
Great. 
... sexual offender is a Caucasian male in his late thirties, approximately six feet tall. 
He apparently works alone, gaining access to homes through unlocked windows and doors. 
- Stand by to change. 
- Local police in Milwaukee are asking anyone who recognizes this sketch to contact them immediately. 
- Change your graphic. And change it. 
- In other news, former President Jimmy Carter continued his campaign 
- for human rights in Beijing this week. 
- Hey! Hey! 
- What? - Guys, the-the... 
- The graphic. - Are you...? 
- Change the graphic! 
- See, the-the-the thing on the... -... on the graphic. 
- Lose the graphic! - Guys! 
- Lose it! Get the... the font on the graphic, like the type on the... 
- Please. - China has been accused 
- by detractors of backsliding... - You just... 
Yep, yep. Yep, yep, yep. 
Stand by to change. Deko in. 
Stand by for the weather. Now, for first look at weather, here's Ernie Appleby. 
Thanks, Colleen. 
I'd like to take a moment to welcome Mike Pomeroy to his first broadcast. 
As one hurricane said to another, I have my eye on you. 
And lookin' across the country today, you'll see we still have that high-pressure system comin' out of the Midwest. 
We'll dissolve to tape. Tape, stand by. 
And go two. Dissolve to Mike, and cue them. 
And ticker in. 
Tomorrow on" Daybreak", we'll show you eight things you didn't know you could do with potatoes. 
Ooh. 
Should be fun. 
Also, we'll talk to some relief workers who say the international community 
- has abrogated its duty to protect... 
- What the hell is abrogated? 
That wasn't on the teleprompter. - Ready to widen on two. 
- And that's our show for this morning. 
Uh, welcome to the" Daybreak" family, Mike. 
- And thank you... 
- Thank you, everyone. 
Goodbye. 
Goodbye. 
Goodbye. 
Goodbye. 
- Goodbye. 
- How many is that? - Goodbye. 
- Three each. 
- Bye. 
- And we're out! - Fade to black. 
You know what you are? 
Excuse me for saying this, but you're an asshole, okay? 
- Becky! What's her last name? 
- You said you would banter! 
No, no, no, no. 
You said I would banter. 
I said I would anchor a news show. 
That's what my contract calls for. 
And that's what I'm going to do. 
But, Mike, you can't just go out there and give monosyllabic answers 
- and talk about... natural disasters! 
- Are you sure? 
Cause I think that's what I just did. 
Anyway, what are you doing here? 
You have to get back to your office and wait for your phone call... from Jimmy Carter. 
- What? 
- Jimmy Carter," sexual offender". 
Now, go away, I'm busy. 
- But Mike, can you just promise... 
Go away. I just go away! 
Hey. It wasn't that bad. 
I don't wanna talk about it. 
Okay. 
- There's a plan. - Mm-hm. 
Sorry, just... Hey. 
I may need to see who that is. 
- Okay. What if... what if something happens? 
- Then someone else will cover the world's biggest pumpkin. 
- That's not fair. 
- No. No. Because you work for a magazine show. 
- Yes. - And you do one 15-minute story... - That's right. 
And we are doing 15 stories a day, none more than three minutes each, 
I mean, maybe three and a half, if it's the President or they're nude photos or something... 
How reliable is your alarm clock? 
- is that the winds have come in... 
- What's goin' on? Fire out west. 
They're looking for an arsonist and they think that he might have set the fire, like, three weeks ago? 
I mean, he could be a serial offender. 
- It's the middle of the night. 
- I'm sorry. 
I... have had such a lovely time. 
I really have and, um, I... 
- I'm so glad that we... - Go. 
- What? 
- You want to go. 
You should go. 
Are you sure about that? 
Get out of here. 
Thank you. 
" Good Morning America" got the mother of the arsonist. 
What? 
Oh! Ass! 
Don't. 
All right, I need an arsonist spouse or something. 
- So you're gettin'scooped like every morning. - Damn it. How come? 
I mean, do you have any kind of plan? 
Yes, the show will still... need some fine-tuning... 
Fine-tuning? 
Really? Can you tune something when nothing is working? 
Mike Pomeroy is the key to making this show work. 
Well, at the moment, he's ruining your show, and to be honest, you haven't got much time for fine-tuning, right? 
- Yeah. I'm not worried. 
- You're... Really? 
I'm... I'm not worried. 
How about profiles? 
We're doing a piece on Daniel Boulud. 
Does it end with me in the kitchen making profiterole? 
No. 
Cornish hens. 
Okay, forget that. 
Uh... How about an interview with Tim McGraw and Faith Hill? 
Either one of them becomes president or cures cancer, let me know. 
Oh, but I do have one good lead. Yeah? 
Yeah, really? 
- I hear you're dating Senor Dipshit. 
- Uh... 
What? - How did you make that happen? 
- Who told you that? 
- Him and you, really? 
- No, I'm... 
Because usually, you know, he dates girls that are sort of, you know with... 
Taffy pullers with... heavy meatballs? 
There's a developing story coming out of Albany, though. 
The governor's tax returns are being audited. 
Oh, for God's sakes, you're killing me, no! 
- I want people to get to know you. 
- No, you don't. 
You want me to pander so you can sell erectile dysfunction medication. 
- Oh, no, I don't. - Well, I won't! 
Oh, my God! It's you! 
You're that guy! 
I just saw you this morning and everyone was eating stuffed zucchini, and you were cranky about it. 
I was like" Oh, my God, there's that guy!" 
You used to do news, right? Like a while ago? 
It's... 
Please, remove your hand from my person. 
Thank you. 
Oh, this is great! 
Thank you! 
I can't believe it! 
Dan Rather! 
- Dan Rather! 
- See? 
People want to like you. 
You're, uh... 
you're in their home every day, and-and, you know, it's an honor and, you know, why can't you just do stories people might enjoy? 
We're in trouble. I'm in trouble. 
Help me, please. 
Dan Rather. For Christ's sake. 
I have a great idea for a segment. 
Get ready for this. 
Past lives. 
If we could find out who celebrities had been in their past lives, I think that would be terrific, don't you? 
I mean, what if Justin Timberlake had been Abraham Lincoln? 
Many actors have changed their names to be taken more seriously. 
Ricky Schroder became Rick. 
The Rock became Dwayne Johnson. 
And Portia de Rossi's name used to be Amanda, but she changed it so as to sound more like the car, which she felt sounded more impressorial. 
A new name has become the latest, hottest accessory for celebrities, like a Birkin bag or a baby. 
Back to you, Mike or... Michael. 
- Dissolve to Mike and ticker in. 
- How did she get here? 
- Don't ask. 
- What? Is she sleeping with someone? 
Pardon me? 
Thanks. 
- Have you seen these? 
- Yes, but... 
You wanna make the ratings worse? That's why you came here? 
Well, no. 
Mike is still... getting up to speed. 
- I'm working on a couple elements. - Gettin' Mike up to speed? 
- Yeah. - You're circling the drain. 
You rarely book anybody decent. Because of the ratings. 
- you're not gettin' any big interviews. 
- We just need more time. 
- Just a little... - God, you're, you're more naive 
- Excuse me? 
The network wants to cancel the show. 
They wanna run game shows and syndicated talk instead. 
For a second, I thought you might have a shot, especially when you got Pomeroy. 
But the joke's on me, cause it turns out you failed even more completely than the network could've thought. 
In six weeks, they cancel the show. 
So, not only will you have significantly weakened our news division, you will have presided over the demise of a show that's been on the air for 47 years! 
Nice work. 
Why don't you go over to PBS and see if you can kill Sesame Street. 
Go. 
You've wasted enough of my time. 
We have six weeks. 
Can you... just not tell anyone yet? 
Because morale isn't exactly at a peak. 
Fine. Tell' em when what you want to. 
It doesn't really matter, does it? 
Piper, get Phil Griffin on the phone. 
Tell him if I don't hear from him by 5 o'clock, those Super Bowl tickets go to Phyllis McGrady! 
- We're live at five, people. - O-kay. 
Feathery, fleecy, flocculent? 
- Oh, for Christ's sake. - What? Wha-what's going on now? 
Mike is offended by a word in the next story. 
He's offended. It's about Easter chicks. 
I'm not saying the word" fluffy". 
It's bad enough I have to do these ridiculous stories. 
Hey, you know what, buddy? 
Guess what? Last week, 
I had to use the words" rectal" and" moisture" in the same sentence. 
- Well, first dates can be awkward. 
- Mike! 
- Becky... - That's it! 
- Becky, Becky, what are you doin'? 
- I've had enough! 
- Mike? I need to talk to you. 
- Becky, we're back in 60. 
I'm sorry, this'll just take a second. 
I've looked up to you all my life. 
You know that? I actually idolized you. 
My dad and I used to watch you on TV. 
So just, you know, imagine my surprise when it turns out that you're actually the worst person in the entire world. 
- Not the third worst! The worst! 
- What's goin' on? 
Pomeroy. 
He broke the latest" Daybreak" EP. 
... how lucky we all are to have these jobs, - how quickly that can be taken away. - We're back in... 
And there's this guy, this really kind of great, smokin' guy who can actually stand me long enough to have sex with me. 
And you know what? 
It's all just a big mess. Because of you! 
You know, nobody... nobody can do their jobs well around here because you can't be bothered to do yours at all! 
And we're back. Welcome back to" Daybreak". 
And now, with a check of the weather, - here's Ernie. 
- Take Ernie on the plaza. 
Thanks, Colleen. 
Surprisingly toasty day out here, isn't it, folks? 
Good day to break out the bikini. 
I know I'm wearing mine right now. 
All right. 
Well, what do we have here? Goodness, honey. 
- Coke? Diet Coke? - No, I don't want a Diet Coke. 
Step aside! 
- Jerry, I would like to talk to you. 
- Now, you're gonna bust a cap in my ass? 
What if I get the ratings up? 
We've got six weeks. 
What if I move that needle just enough? 
- You won't. 
- We'll, you're... you don't know that. 
- Becky. - There's gotta be some number 
I can hit that will give us a shot, that would give us an extra six months, 
- something. - Sure, if you got over one point five 
- or something absurd like that... 
- Done! So, I've got your word? 
I get those ratings up more than three quarters of a point, 
- you give me more time? 
- It won't happen. 
We'll see about that. Oh! 
And your girlfriend, Lisa? 
Can you get her a dictionary and stick her on somebody else's show? 
Cause she's killing me. 
Wow, well, look who the wind blew in! 
What happened to you? 
Well, we're gonna change a few things. 
- Okay. - Is Ernie in place? 
Yes, he is. 
He'll be interviewing people as they come off the coaster. 
No, he won't. 
Not anymore, he's not. We're gonna put him on that coaster. 
We're gonna strap a handheld to the car in front of him and then go live. 
Boom. It's called" picking up the game", people. 
Okay? 
So, from now on, every single story that we do, it's gonna have to be sensational! 
We're gonna be more aggressive. 
We're gonna work harder. 
And we're gonna do it right now. 
- Are-are you gonna...? 
- I'm not gonna sing! 
Why do people ask me that? 
So, the big question is, are we gonna be able to hear his mike? 
Yes, we will. 
If he has a heart attack, we'll be able to capture every heart-rending scream. 
- Really? 
Great. 
- Cue her. 
Thrill-seekers have something to look forward to this summer as Six Flags unveils a brand-new roller coaster. 
The" Manhandler" is the fastest coaster in the U.S. 
- with speeds up to 130 miles an hour... 
- Stand Ernie by. 
Here we go. 
... ninety-five degrees. Our own Ernie Appleby is getting a sneak peek at this amazing new ride, isn't that right, Ernie? 
- Standing by. Open his mike. 
- Ernie, can you hear us? Yes. 
Yes, I can. And so far, it's a beautiful ride. 
Uh, quite an amazing view from up here. 
Mostly blue skies. Cumulus clouds on the horizon, always a good sign this time of year. 
Might be heading into our first dip. 
Oh, my. Oh, my. 
Oh, fu... 
Oh, yeah. 
No, this is a great idea. 
- Please, make it stop! 
- Take two. 
What are you gonna do to him next? 
Strap electrodes to his balls? 
I actually felt sorry for that animatronic puppet asshole. 
Hey, look, we got 80,000 hits on YouTube already. 
And Ernie is absolutely thrilled. 
Oh, and by the way, we had another bump in the minute-to-minutes. 
- Becky, good stuff. 
- Thank you! 
Lighten up, Mike. 
You know what I've noticed? 
People only say" Lighten up" when they're gonna stick their fist up your ass. 
Well, you know what? 
I hate to break it to you, - but the fact is... 
Thank you. The world has been debating news versus entertainment for years and guess what? 
Mike, your side lost. 
- You know what? - What? 
You're wrong. 
People are smart. 
They want information. Not junk, which is all you're willing to give them. 
- Junk. 
Sugar, sugar, sugar. 
- Excuse me. 
- Oh. Okay. - And more sugar. 
Yeah, well, wha-wha-what would you have them do, Mike? 
Uh, uh, eat, ooh, ooh, bran all day? 
Fiber, fiber, fiber? 
We have to get the ratings up, Mike, or we can have a lot of high-minded ideas and not be on the air. 
This show may go down, but it's not because I'm not trying my hardest. 
You hear me? 
I don't care what you do, but I'm not giving up. 
Eh-eh. I wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to you right now about Ernie. 
- Oh, my God, you, too? 
- Yes. Why is everyone worried about Ernie? You know, he's a grown man. 
- Worried about Ernie? 
You kidding me? - He signed release forms. 
He's a hack. 
Look, I see what you're doing. 
I think it's great. 
It's exactly what I've been waiting for, so just, you know, sign me up, coach. 
Put me in. - Whatever you want to call it, all right? 
- Really? Yeah. 
Do you have any preexisting conditions? 
Are you kidding? 
Look at me. I'm a rock. 
Would you like to hold him? 
I would love to hold it, dear little thing. 
Watch it carefully. He doesn't go in there. 
Can you get it out though? 
Mike wanted to be here for this. Mike Pomeroy. 
You know how he is. He loves animals. 
Have you just... You... And then... 
Those are frog lips. Does a frog open its lips ever? 
Ready four, take four. 
Ready one. Take it. - I would never do that. 
- Kiss it. 
How about a big kiss, sucker? 
That's a little, that's wrong. 
That was so good. Do it again. 
Fitty, Fitty! Mr. Cent? 
Hi! Uh... fan. 
Big fan! 
Take you to the candy shop 
- Whoa, let you lick 
- I heard the song. 
I'm a producer for" Daybreak" and we would so love to have you on our show. 
We would give you twice as much time as the" Today Show". 
And you could play four songs from your new record. 
Just think about it. 
Ready one, take one! Ready two! 
On the rabbi story, do you want the transvestite prostitute - to be dressed as a man or a woman? 
- A man. 
- Man. - No, a woman. 
No, have him / her start the segment as a woman and then, boom, after the break, he / she comes back as a man! 
- Yes. That's it. - Yes. 
Back to you, Colleen. 
- All right! 
They've cut! - Both. 
Emphatically. Here are the ratings. 
I-I know, I know. 
Yes, yes. 
And when we come back, we'll tell you about new ways to cope with menopause. 
New doorknobs. 
Okay. - And am I doing it right? 
- Yes. 
Oh, good. How do you know? You're not looking. 
Or... we could do a whole series on senior weight loss. 
We could get that health expert, you know, the one with the... 
It's good, it's good, it's good. 
I'll do it. 
Wait! 
Wait, look. 
The week-to-weeks are better and total viewers are up by five percent! 
And those are not good enough! 
Turns out the burger patties were contaminated with E. coli, which can cause cramping and diarrhea. 
- Lose the ticker, music in... - We'll be right back on" Daybreak". 
Dissolve the logo. And... mark. 
And we're out. 
Great, a story about uncontrollable shitting and look who gets it. 
Well, it's not my sort of thing. 
Can I just say one thing? That's our job. 
I know you think you're above it and, of course, you... were above it before you got fired. 
But now, guess what, you're down in the muck with the rest of us, Mike. 
And yet I still have standards, unfortunately for you. 
- Suppose I don't have standards? 
- Sure you do. 
When you got your Pap smear on air, you wore a silk robe. 
- Okay! 
- Classy touch. - We're back in five... 
- That is it! I've had it with you! I've had it! 
- Three... and two... - Go, two. 
-... one. 
- Dissolve and cue. 
Tomorrow on the show, Colleen will make the British classic bangers 
- and mash, with chef Gordon Ramsay. 
- That's right, I will, because you refuse to do it, Mike. 
Guess... it's beneath you. 
Well, that and it's tough to get between you and a sausage, so... 
Sausage, that's a good one. 
Yes, and also you are... a fatuous, pretentious idiot, 
- so there's that. 
- A fatuous idiot who makes 
- three times what you make. 
- Well, that's our show for this morning. 
See you tomorrow, folks. 
Goodbye. 
- Goodbye. - Goodbye. 
- Goodbye. - And goodbye. 
- Goodbye. - Bye. 
- Yeah, no, no, no. - Bye. 
This is yesterday, - after she insulted his tie. 
- Right. After he asked her if she cries ice cubes. Huge spike. 
They love it! 
We're so close. 
I mean, we need this. We're-we're-we're almost there. 
Coming up in our next hour, we'll be talking to people who successfully completed this innovative rehab program. 
Might wanna pick up a few tips there, Mike. 
Do they have rehab programs for bitter beauty queens with self-esteem issues? 
I wonder about that sometimes. 
Sometimes. 
Well, coming up next... 
But they are... way better. They're-they're-they're way up from last year. 
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm almost there. 
So many people rely on this show. They believe in it. 
You still have until Friday. 
That's the deal we made. And those are still not good enough. 
-... to help folks if necessary, Kitty. - What? 
Sorry. 
I mean, our demos are getting better. 
But our overall numbers, they're just not where they should be. 
We're just missing... something. 
Well, maybe it's time for another eight-part series on the orgasm. 
Do you think so? 
I mean, I don't know what else we would possibly talk about. 
- Oh, you're making fun of me. 
- No. 
Never mind. 
Just, uh... doesn't matter. 
I'll just, uh, deal with it in the morning. 
You look at me like there's something wrong with me... all the time. 
- And I can't, I can't do it. 
- What? 
That is the most ridiculous statement you have ever made. 
I can't let my guard down for one second, you know. 
I-I-I don't look at my BlackBerry and I miss getting the next big story. 
And I'm tired of feeling guilty about my work. 
I ca... I can't. 
Becky, wait a second! 
Yeah. Okay. Look, that information's a matter of public record. 
I have a right to see it. You know that. 
You want me to come on down there and I'll bring a crew? 
Better yet, a subpoena. 
Okay, and I think we should end the segment with Ernie being tarred and feathered in honor of the anniversary of the Boston Tea Party. 
Or I could do my good story on weathervanes. 
No! 
Okay, so, great job, everyone. 
Excuse me, excuse me. Just one-one moment, please. 
I have a story I'd like to do. 
Sauerkraut. 
Sauerkraut? 
Big annual Sauerkraut Festival upstate. 
They, uh, bowl with cabbage, make a big sauerkraut cake. 
They, uh, have a competition for the best sauerkraut. 
You want to do that? 
What? Do you have a problem with that? 
Uhh... No. 
It's okay? I'm-I'm doing the kraut? 
Right? 
- I-i-if you, if you want to. 
- Good. Good. 
- Hi! - Don't really have to go, you know. 
I want to. 
Oh, my goodness. I wouldn't miss this for... 
- Get in. - All right. 
Say hello to Joe. 
- Joe, Becky. 
Becky, Joe. 
Go. - Hi, Joe. Wait. 
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
This isn't the way. 
No, no. 
- Mike, where are we going? 
- To cover the news. 
- What? 
- At 8 a.m. this morning, 
- I'm going to cover a story. - Mike. 
- A real story. 
- Are you kidding me? 
- Where are you? 
- I don't know. 
- What do you mean you don't know? 
- Well, he won't tell me. 
He's kidnapped me. 
He's gone around some kind of bend and I need you to get Colleen ready with a backup story, please! 
- What backup story? 
- Let Ernie do the weathervane thing. 
- No, no, no, no. - I need something when Mike's story tanks. Jesus. 
You know, you're a terrible person! 
You baited me with sauerkraut. 
That's so low. 
I mean, what the hell is this story, Mike? 
- The governor. 
- What governor? 
We're not even anywhere near Albany. No, we're not. 
It's up here a little further, Joe. 
- Oh, my God, this is the governor's country house. Are you out of your mind? 
You're experiencing a psychotic break. 
Well, I-I won't be dragged down with you. 
You're gonna get us arrested and fired. 
I get fired, I never work again, you lunatic. 
I'm not gonna run it, Mike. I won't, you can't make me. 
I'll run Colleen getting her bikini line waxed before I run it. Mike! 
They're gonna cancel the show! 
If we don't get our numbers up by the end of this week, we're toast. 
We're gonna be replaced by soap operas and... game shows. 
Come on, Joe. 
- Lenny, are you ready? 
- Ready? 
- Ready? 
- Check, check. 
- Hey. You'll know when to go live. 
Get out of my shot. 
Go live with what? 
Pomeroy! 
- Gary, how are ya? 
- What the hell are you doin'here? 
I need the weathervanes, Lenny. 
- I need' em, need... 
- So, we're goin' with weathervanes. - Yes. 
- Specifically, we'd like to know how you feel about the Attorney General's filing racketeering charges against you this morning. 
- Charges of corruption... 
- No, wait, wait. 
-... and steering government contracts. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
- We cannot wait! 
- Hold your horses. 
And there's a hooker or two... in there as well, isn't there, sir? 
- Oh, my God. 
- Becky! - What is going on here? 
- Comin' through! Mike, I don't know where you get your information. 
You know I like you. 
- Stand by to go live. - What? 
... but if you don't leave, I'm gonna have to call the police. 
- I don't think that's gonna be necessary, sir. - Wait, wait one second. 
Becky! 
Live! 
Live! Live to Becky, now! 
- Up on rem two! - Now taking you live to Mike Pomeroy for a special report. 
Federal authorities have been planning this raid for weeks. 
This reporter has learned that the indictment contains 15 counts of racketeering and using undue influence. 
My sources tell me authorities have tapped phone calls, and incriminating e-mails. 
Mike Pomeroy," Daybreak". 
Back to you in the studio. 
- Take two. 
- Thanks, Mike. 
Partly cloudy skies this afternoon with slight chance... You know, you could have told me. 
I might have covered it anyway. 
Liar. 
Look, I get it. 
Nobody really cares that I can do this job, but, uh... 
But I can. 
I wanted you to see that. 
That was a great story, Mike. that was better than a great story, that was great television. That was... 
I mean, that was... bran with a doughnut. 
A bran doughnut. 
I've got a grandkid. 
Did you know that? 
Alexander. 
I haven't seen him since I got fired. 
I was embarrassed... 
after all I'd accomplished. 
And then to... come back to the news... 
The truth is, I'd... I'd screwed up with my kids... 
way before I got canned. 
Anyway, I... 
I was never at home and... when I was, I took every phone call, watching TV out of the corner of my eye... 
Why am I telling you this? 
You're worse than I am. 
You'd sleep at the office if you could. 
Let me tell you how it turns out. 
You end up with... with nothing. 
Nothing. 
Which is... 
which is what I had... till you came along. 
Wait a second. 
Did you just say something nice to me? 
I told you I could banter. 
They're not... awful. 
How much longer can we get? 
Well, I have to check with upstairs, but, uh... with these I can get you a year, a comfortable year. 
I underestimated you, Becky. 
Oh, that's... that's very, very true. 
NBC called. 
NBC? 
Wanted to know how much time you have on your contract. 
The" Today Show" wants you. 
Well, that's very flattering. I... 
Is that what you want? 
They were gonna cancel the show. 
- Okay. 
- Yeah. And somehow, we saved it. 
And, you know, the thing is... 
is that the second I knew that everything was gonna be okay, the person that I wanted to tell was you. 
The" Today Show"? 
That's huge. 
Yeah, yeah, it's-it's-it's incredible. 
But I-I have to think about it. I... 
- What? 
- Oh, yeah, I mean, I... 
Well, the thing is-is that, at" Daybreak", everyone's really starting to click. 
You know? Everybody's pitching in and doing what they're best at. 
- No story too high or low. 
- No, hold on, you can't say no to this. 
When you get an opportunity like this, 
- you have to grab it. 
- Even Mike is almost happy. 
And that's a good enough reason to give up the best job in broadcasting? 
We're... 
" Daybreak" is a... family now. 
Becky, I've known Mike a long time. 
I... It doesn't matter how happy he is. 
He's not just gonna suddenly change into a different person. 
Well, I think you're wrong. 
I know what I'm doing with him now. 
I do. 
It's gonna be great. 
So, we've got the Supreme Court Justice hearings at the top of the hour and then, uh... 
Ooh! I forgot to tell you, Anthony Bourdain 
- wants to do a segment with you! - Bourdain? 
Love' im. Not doin' that. 
But say hi to Tony. I owe him a bottle of Patron. 
- Um... what...? - What? 
We do one good story together and suddenly I'm your bitch? 
Don't think so. 
Sorry. 
Wait. 
Wait, wait, wait. You can't do one story for me? 
Oh, my God, what is wrong with me? 
What am I doing here, beating my head against this wall? 
I might as well go to the" Today Show" where you don't have to poke -... 
Matt Lauer with a stick... - The" Today Show"? 
- Yes, they offered me a job. 
- Of course. - But you know what? 
I said... 
- Time to move on. 
You'll love the" Today Show". 
You and Vieira can do menopause stories every week! 
You know what's really ridiculous? 
Is that until about ten seconds ago, 
I'd actually considered turning my back on the best job I've ever been offered. 
Isn't that totally absurd? 
What's keeping you? 
Okay. 
You know, if you'd ever treated me with some kind of friendship or loyalty, or.. or trust, these things that you seem incapable of... you miserable, lonely, egotistical, selfish asshole! 
- Hey, Becky. 
- Hi. They called again." Today Show". 
Thanks. 
Becky Fuller. 
Obviously, we have a long track record of success here at the" Today Show", but, uh, we're always looking to stay current, to get out of our comfort zone, and, um, we want the show 
to have that... youthful energy. And we are so impressed with what you have done with" Daybreak". 
Oh, well, thank you... very much. 
I-I appreciate it. 
Everyone is talking about it. You must know that. 
I mean, you have done an amazing job of revitalizing a show that many people had just completely written off. 
Well, thank you. Thanks. 
And we're out! 
You did this. 
They're gonna hire her. 
Yeah. She's at the" Today Show" right now, ding dong. 
Do-do you have any idea, you know, what you've done here? 
Because we had a decent producer, a decent show and, 
God forbid, anyone around here should be happy, but... you had to have this happen, didn't you? 
All right, stand by, folks. Here we go. Three, two, one. 
And dissolve two. 
And cue' em! Cue' em! 
- Welcome back to" Daybreak". 
- Oh-ho, what-what is wrong? 
... a look at the nation's crumbling infrastructure. Go to Colleen. Jesus, jump off Mike. 
- Where the hell is he going? - Take three, three. 
Cue over to three. Swing her to three, please. 
Come on, Jane, over to three. 
Sorry, the... this segment's usually a two shot of Mike and Colleen and Mike's not there. 
They've probably just changed something. 
Sorry. 
I don't know. Where is Mike? 
- I need eggs. - You need what? 
You know, from chickens. 
Eggs! 
Really don't enjoy this job. 
Chinese people, move, move, move! 
Thank you! 
Celery. Peppers. Cheese. 
Yeah, thank you very much. 
We, uh, wanted to know what your plans are for sports coverage. 
Oh, sports. Great, okay. Uh, great. 
I... love sports. 
Come on, move, move! 
Let's go, let's go! 
- Get it in there, slide it in! - Mike, tell us what you need. 
I need a cutting board, good knife, nice plate, bowl, whisk. 
What is this, rubber? 
Get me a real bowl. - Where are my eggs? 
! - Cue over to three. 
- Where are my goddamn eggs? ! - Eggs for Mike, please! 
In respect to sports, I think that it's really important to reach out to women through their kids because, you know, it's not that big of a step to go from being a soccer mom to, you know, a... 
Oh, my God. 
What is he doing? 
Sorry, I just... This is... 
Mike Pomeroy is having a nervous breakdown... on air. 
That's kind of big news. 
... a meal for their afternoon repast, something they could make using whatever ingredients 
- they had available. 
- Holy shit. 
I've been making frittata for about... 20 years now, ever since I was taught how to, on a naked weekend with a beautiful Italian movie star, who shall, of course, remain... nameless. 
Occasionally, I make them at home. 
But only for people that I... 
People I really care about. 
Now the key to a great frittata is a very hot pan, because that, my friends, 
is what makes it... fluffy. 
- Dash of pepper. - I'm sorry. I, uh... 
You watchin' this? 
- Becky? 
- Yes, I... yeah. 
He is not gonna ask you twice. 
Bye! 
Thanks! 
Stand by. He's goin' back to the oven. 
Ready three. 
A lot of people like a glass of di Gavi. 
Gavi di Gavi, perhaps. 
I, myself, like a... Barolo. 
I'll just free up the edges. 
Next week on the show, I'll show you how to make a fantastic beignet, which the rabble like to call... doughnuts. 
The old bastard. 
You know, he's still the third worst person in the world. 
Yeah, I know. 
That's good. 
That's really good. 
I want a tropical fruit plate. 
" His gravity leavens the silliness of morning TV, making for an incongruous but somehow perfect match. 
Turns out that after 40 years in the business, the real Mike Pomeroy has finally arrived." 
Not bad. 
By the way, I'm getting my prostate checked next week. 
I thought I'd take a crew with me. 
- That's a great idea. 
We... - Jesus, I'm kidding. 
No, seriously, they-they have these little teeny, tiny cameras 
- that go right up your... 
- No, no, no. What if we got you a body double? 
- No! 
- No? Not in a thousand years. 
You know, I do a shit load of reading and studying and praying and I've come to a few conclusions I wanna share. 
People look at politicians and celebrities on the TV and the newspapers... glossy magazines, what do they see? 
" I am just like them." That's what they say. " I'm special. I'm different. 
Well, guess what? 
You can't! You know why? 
Cause in reality, mediocrity's where most people lived. 
Mediocrity is the elephant of the room. 
Mediocrity's in your schools, it's in your dreams, it's in your family. 
Those of us who knows this, those of us who understand the disease of the dull, we do something about it. 
We do more because we have to. 
The deck was always stack against us. 
You're either a big leader or you're a slave clawing your way onto the sea train. 
Some people said Jack Abramoff moved too fast, Jack Abramoff cuts corner. 
Well, I said to them, if that's the difference between me and my family having a good life and walking the news in the subway everyday... then so be it. 
I'll not allowed my family to be slaves. 
I will not allowed the world I touched to be vanilla. 
You said I'm selfish, fuck you! 
I gave back, I gave back plenty. 
You said I've got a big ego? Fuck you twice! 
I'm humbly grateful, for the wonderful gifts that I received here in America... the greatest country on this planet. 
I'm Jack Abramoff, and oh yeah, I worked out every day. 
Mr. Sprague? Susan Schmidt of the Washington Post. 
- Find it alright? 
- Yeah, thanks for seeing me. 
I've got a lot of questions for you. 
- Jack Abramoff, right? 
- I hear he was charging the tribe an exorbitant fees. 
- 30 million or more. 
- So, I guess you've met his partner Mike Scanlon too? 
Oh yeah, he's a real cowboy. 
Looks like they might be in some troubles. 
- Jack? - Honey! 
- Jack? ! - Dad... 
- Mikey. Hey, I've been calling you all day, dude. 
- Where are you? 
- I'm in L.A. What the fuck are you doing in L.A.? 
Our world's collapsing here. 
Wait! What have you heard? Are you going to be indicted? 
Like a federal marshall is looking for me, okay. 
- I had a hundred media calls today. 
- We're under horrific assault from the - workforce, that isn't our culture. - I know... 
I know, Hey, you're the only one that returned my call. 
The president probably destroying every picture he ever took with you. 
Well, you're no one in this town until you've met us. 
That isn't funny, Jack. 
Don't fucking mess with my qi here. 
I'm serious. We're super fuck here, okay. 
They're calling us the new Watergate, Jack! We're about to be on the nightly news. 
Step up to the line. 
Dear Mr. President, I write you this petition with hope and prayers. 
As a man of faith, I've come to see God moves in mysterious way. 
After we're born, he gave us the choice of two paths. 
- Please don't smile. 
- I am not smiling. 
Accept the world the way it is. 
Or see it for how we might want it to be. 
I need a right. 
To me, the choice was obvious. 
How long you'll be holding me here? 
You can get that information from your lawyer. 
I do get my own cell, right? 
I only eat kosher, okay. 
You do serve kosher! 
Mr. Abramoff, this is a federal holding facility. 
It is not kosher. 
Jack Abramoff. 
Snake. 
What are you in for, Snake? 
Assault and battery, resisting arrest... chicken shit... things like that. 
How about you? 
Oh me? 
I work in D.C. 
- I am a lobbyist. 
- Lobbyist. That against the law? 
Lobbyists - Noun 1. 
A person who tries to influence legislation on behalf of a special interest. 
A person who tries to influence public officials to take a desired action. 
Two Years Earlier... 
Next to God, faith and country, nothing's more important than influence. 
Political influence. 
Influences with the powerful is like the influence with God. 
Without it, there's only eternal hellfire, damnation and congressional log jam. 
Here, the influence we wield is more important than the air you breathe. 
As a licensed lobbyist I'm legally allowed to accept money from special interests in order to influence Congress on their behalf. 
I'm essentially a conduit to motivating sleepy lawmakers into getting bills passed and legislations done. 
The reality is, without lobbyists the wheels of WA would come to a grinding halt. 
How much do you looking to requisite about? Can you tell me that in dollars term? 
Because the most powerful Members of Congress relied on lobbyists like me for information to guide them on how to vote and how they vote sometimes required taking them on facts finding mission. 
Like House Majority leader Tom Delay we brought to the Northern Mariana islands in the South Pacific. 
A U.S. territory, where my textile clients produced American-made designer clothes without having to pay minimum wage. 
Well, these folks seems happy. How are you? 
- I felt good, thank you. 
We should be able to vote favorably on this, Jack. 
For example, your top of the line stone-wash jeans can stay on sale for $ 19.95 - 
Simply because labor costs in the Marianas remained low. 
Jack's pushing Mr. Delay hard to make sure the minimum wage legislation stay off Congresses shecdule. 
Hey, you troglodytes, will you make sure that Delay gets the latest export numbers from Willy in case the Senate tries to kill this thing. 
Lobbying is nothing more than American style democracy in action. 
And the more influences we have - the bigger the smile on our kid's faces. 
Good morning, gentlemen. 
Grover, what brings you to locker room? 
Don't even bother trying to pitch him on our new client, he has issues with helping our native's people. 
Just with natives American, Jack. 
What do they have to do with American for tax reform? I need your help on this one, Grover. 
I need the Congressional friends in your organization to understand there are certain American Indian tribes that need help. 
Jack, United States from day one was founded on the basis that you could be or do anything you want to. 
You're in charge of your own future. There is no ceiling, there is no floor - 
You want to be a bum, you can be a bum. 
You want to accomplish great things, you can do that too. 
So, natives American chose to live in third world conditions, why is that my problem, huh? 
- Are those pistachios? 
- Yeah, genuis. 
Listen, this is perfect for you, Grover. 
It is philanthropic. 
I mean - The money we're saving them is essentially paying for their health clinics and schools. 
- Help them help themselves. - Yeah, come on! 
There's no one on the stand as persuasive as you are. 
- You are a Harvard man, dude. - Yeah... yeah! 
The man with the crimson tongue. 
Grover, all we are trying to do is help these people empowered themselves. 
Jack, I've known you for 25 years. 
Why do I think your social gravitates is more than just about health connections-schools? 
- Veuve Clicquot, sir? - Thank you. 
You're welcome. 
- Ice tea? 
- Thank you. 
- Merlot with three ice cubes. 
- Thank you. 
Seriously, I think I once got a lap dance from her on" Nexus Gold." 
- I wouldn't know, Mikey. 
I'm married. 
- I thought I recognized her too, si. 
I liked the good lord would prefer I have deaf ear on this one. 
- We all set? - Check! 
18 holes, St. Andrews, 5 stars hotel. 
Hugh Fraser, the British Open champion on hand to give a lesson lolly fucking doll. 
Restaurants tour in Edinburgh, two days stopover at the Hyde Park Oriental in London. Oh... 
VIP tickets to The Lion King for Tom. 
Nice soft grip, soft hand. Take a whack at her. 
Great shot! Great! Now I gotta sandbag my drive so Ponchos doesn't spew on his shoes. 
Ponchos been prime to arrange that he got his picture taken with Bush. 
Three years ago, his tribe is weaving pine needles and selling key chains. 
Now he must be able to drive a Hummer and buy condos in Hawaii. 
You tell me why these clowns get to own casinos and made 20 millions a year? 
Well, I don't know? 
Maybe 300 years of genocide, that's not good enough reason for you, champ? 
- Are you part Mohawk now? 
- Yes indeed, Kimosabe! 
- One of the lost tribes of Israel. 
- Yep yep. You tried to play Indian. 
- No wonder they liked you so much. 
You know what blows my mind? All these Indians are so damn rich and still acting like Wal-mart shoppers. 
He is a multi-millionaire, Jack, with a $ 10 watch. 
Listen, if you and I could accessed some of that liquid, - we would be running D.C. in no time. 
- What are you suggesting? 
I'm suggesting that they pay us a ridiculous amount of money, okay. 
And then, you and I can split the fees 50-50 under the table. 
It's a little tough on the Chippewa, not to mention is it legal? 
What are they gonna do? Cancel my membership at the ACLU? 
You know, I've got a limit on what I can charge. 
Shucks for you but I'm freelance, Jack! 
I'm grass root, baby. 
You're always complaining about living hand to mouth 
You know what? 
You deserve better. 
And Chief Shack-a-lot there, is our ticket out of our leady health. 
- That's it, chief. - Okay, put together a pitch for Tonto, - let's see what he says. 
Look, I've handled the Coushattas, the Tiguas, the Aguas, Caliente's... and I tell them all the same thing, chief. 
I know what it feels like to be a persecuted minority. 
Yeah, well it's about time you guys in Washington finally did something good for Indian people. 
Like give America back? 
You've got a real sense of humor, Jack. I like that. 
Look! The casinos are a plus if it's profitable. 
But in reality the gaming industry is very competitive. 
You know, the Jena tribe, they want to open up their own casino now. 
- They're just one state away. 
- Yeah, I know those guys. They can be brutal. 
They can shut you down mega fast. 
No more Chippewa casinos. 
You need our help, chief. 
- You heard Mike's proposal? - It's a tough call. 
It's a hell of a fees you're asking for. 
- But think of the billions that you're gonna saved. - Kind of a record, isn't it? 
I can guaranteed you that goddamn Jena tribe casino will never opens. 
And before you know it, the Jena tribe gonna be back selling moccasins. 
You know, Mr. Abramoff, we can't afford to lose this one. 
You won't. 
Swear to God! 
Give me five! 
I told you, team Abramoff! 
- To giving America back to the Indians 
All hail to Washington - biggest retainer. 
- Fucking A! You're no one in this town, if you haven't met Jack fucking A Abramoff. 
- Take it easy, Bill. 
Jack, you know I believe my fiance Emily, 
- everybody from the Bush's inaugural. 
- I'll never forget that night. McCain was in his office pounding Bush bills :" We lost!" 
It's very sincere moderate believe from every voters. 
Amen to that! 
Hey, Jack. 
Those Polynesian factories you wrapped to make the blue jeans on the Mariana Islands... 
- Yeah, what about them? 
- Words on the streets, is they're goddamn sweat shops and rape camps. 
Oh, all you guys from the Washington Post wants to be Woodward Bernstein. Fucking pathetic. 
That's so? The Labour department just fined your client $ 9 million dollars. 
Must be for something. 
Hey listen, bad breath. 
The mistakes will happen but the truth is you can't tell me those immigrants are making more money than they would in China - sending it back to their families. 
- That's right, we are greasing the wheels with American dollars, baby. 
- Capitalism at its finest. - Doing the Lord's works. 
Dosen't sound much like American democracy to me. 
No democracy, no fucking capitalism. No capitalism, no fucking democrary. 
Chrissy only goddamn communistist slave-driven Bolshevism. 
- Thank you, Joe McCarthy. 
- Fucking elitist. - What? 
- What's wrong with you? Calm down. 
Someone called 911. Scott is a hemophialic. 
You just hit a hemophialic reporter from the Washington Post. 
- It's okay. It's fine. Did you see that? 
This is not good. 
- Enid, get Delay for me, will you? 
- Should I remind him of Bible class Thursday afternoon? 
- Bible class is Thursday? - Yeah... 
Jack. 
Remember I switch it with your golf game. 
Well... Enid, you know sometimes even those of us who occupied the oval office can have our senior moments. 
Yes, Mr. President. 
Oh Jack... Mr. Rouvelas is here. 
Make sure I see it before it goes out, okay! 
Manny. 
- Let's grab a coffee. 
- Hey listen, if it's about the Jarrell incident, no worries... I fired him yesterday. 
The guy was a loose cannon. 
It's not like The Post is an important paper in this town. 
- Yeah, can we saved this for later? 
- Bear with me, it's important. 
Alright, Manny. So, where's the fire? 
We hired you because the partners felt we needed someone who have friends in the Bush administration. 
It's not about friends, Manny... it's about ideas. 
Then you guys on the right used to have ideas. 
But now that communism is gone, all you think about is money. 
So you invite me out for an iced vanilla cha just to remind me that I'm a right wing fascist, that's kind of beneath you, isn't it Manny! 
? What's beneath me... 
Jack, are the clients you dragged into my shop. Bottom feeder in the rag trade in the Mariana Islands. 
You know there's an upside for the poor Chinese. 
They get to send money back to their families in the mainland. 
And look at all the great works we're doing for the Choctaw, the Chippewa...
